1
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,912
The tension mounts, hits the roof
and falls to earth with a bang...

2
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,409
I'd like some prawns.

3
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,608
Prawns? I'm afraid...

4
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,243
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

5
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:05,994
- I'd like a salad then.
- With Parma ham? Parmesan cheese?

6
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,397
And then?
We have salmon... cheese.

7
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:15,596
It sounds lovely,
but I'm afraid I can't afford it.

8
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:20,739
Can we afford a mineral water?
Or shall we use the faucet?

9
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,978
- A mineral water.
- A mineral water. Certainly.

10
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:48,464
Your salad. Bon appetit.

11
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,868
Come along.

12
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,780
- No.
- Yes, come along.

13
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,784
No, no.

14
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,635
- Stoffer, pick that up!
- Klaus is coming.

15
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,580
Hi!

16
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,249
Hi, hi!

17
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:36,414
Stoffer, I don't think
they think it's funny.

18
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:47,031
There's nothing to be afraid of,
nothing is happening.

19
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,432
Nothing is happening.

20
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,371
- Hi, hi.
- Hi.

21
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,409
Hi.

22
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:01,273
Hi.

23
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,849
- Excuse me...

24
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,953
You must keep him under control.

25
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,555
- He won't do anything.
- I must consider the other diners.

26
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:23,430
Henrik, Henrik,
where are you going?

27
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,469
- Where are you going?
- Klaus is coming.

28
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,908
Let's sit down again
like the waiter wants.

29
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:32,570
Shut up!

30
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:38,573
- It's... it's his birthday.
- Happy Birthday, but it won't do.

31
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:42,349
Stoffer, come on, we're going home.

32
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,979
- No!
- Easy, now.

33
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,187
Stoffer, Stoffer, easy now.
Nothing's going to happen.

34
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:55,292
- Shut up.
- It's no good us being here, right?

35
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,500
Come on, Christoffer, we're going.

36
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,805
You and me?
Shall we go outside together?

37
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,073
- Would you?
- If he'd like to.

38
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,909
You'd be most welcome.

39
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:18,549
- Klaus is coming.
- Yes, he may be outside already.

40
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,027
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye and thank you.

41
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,793
OK, Stoffer, let go now.

42
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,429
She's not coming any further.
Let's go now.

43
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,702
Stoffer, let go.

44
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,767
- It doesn't matter.
- Let go! The lady's not coming.

45
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,673
Stoffer, let go.
I've had enough.

46
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,428
I've had enough.
If you're going to be like this.

47
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,249
I don't think it's funny.

48
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:23,448
- Sorry, Susanne.
- Yes, sorry.

49
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:27,755
What the hell could we do?
That lunch would have cost a fortune.

50
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,992
- You do have the fare, don't you?
- Of course.

51
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,370
They're just...
Don't mind them.

52
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,671
Don't worry.

53
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:54,780
Karen was the last to join the group.

54
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,722
She was really nice.
It wasn't that.

55
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,783
Karen was really nice,
but she was also...

56
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,387
I think she'd have joined anything.

57
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,987
I don't know how she came
to the factory, but she did.

58
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:11,828
I don't know...
I don't know what she thought.

59
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,897
She was right when she said,
"You're poking fun."

60
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,141
Yes, we were poking fun.

61
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,048
Hi, Stoffer.

62
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,282
Hi.

63
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,315
Now we get out of the car again,
right?

64
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,590
Are you the person I talked to?
Welcome to the factory.

65
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,788
Oh, you've brought a wheelchair?

66
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:50,142
Don't leave her behind.

67
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:05,280
It may sound a bit... a bit dull.

68
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:13,823
But when you get to know it,
it's actually a fascinating product.

69
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:18,530
Hey, no, no!
You mustn't do that.

70
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,562
Watch this.

71
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,804
I'm going to stop the entire
production of Rockwool in Denmark.

72
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:32,047
- And it stops.
- No!

73
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,855
- No!
- Don't worry.

74
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,156
Hey, you! Come over here!
Don't be frightened.

75
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,596
Press the green button.
Do you see it? Come on!

76
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:01,178
It's fireproof, as you see.
Nothing's on fire.

77
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:04,741
Don't be frightened.
Nothing will happen. Wait for the bang.

78
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,821
Shall we have a soda?
Yeah...

79
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:15,692
Don't press that...
Just let it hang there.

80
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:26,098
Now, you've heard about
Rockwool and how it works.

81
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,737
Now, I'll ask you...

82
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:33,006
which of these houses
is insulated with Rockwool?

83
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:37,273
Yes?

84
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,717
Come on up...

85
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,914
That was almost right.

86
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:48,655
Those who think this one is insulated
with Rockwool put your hands up.

87
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,862
Rather a lot...

88
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,635
I think I can hear your minibus.

89
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,506
I think they're leaving.
Don't get left behind.

90
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,000
There.
That's the best place, almost.

91
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,845
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

92
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,873
That's the lot.
Give us a hand, Karen.

93
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,488
Who... is he driving?

94
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,460
Responsibility does them good.
No, not...

95
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:43,380
- Is that really a good idea?
- No harm done, he's doing fine.

96
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,807
Reverse, reverse!

97
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,519
Thanks for coming.

98
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:02,459
We have a driver
Who is a nutter

99
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:07,234
At our camp
At our camp

100
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:12,301
We have a driver
Who is a nutter

101
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,836
At our camp
Where we are...

102
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,110
What do you think?

103
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,519
I don't think it was very funny.

104
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:26,218
Why not?

105
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,351
You poke fun.

106
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:43,506
- They're the ones who poke fun.
- Stoffer, cool it.

107
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,221
Anders speaking.

108
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,461
Is that you, Karen?

109
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:27,773
Jeppe copped out right in the middle
and it pisses me off.

110
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,804
He didn't cop out.

111
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,849
- But you think so?
- He wasn't there.

112
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,820
It was written all over his face.

113
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:40,224
You should fucking well play along.

114
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,023
Leave him alone.

115
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,190
Did you think I was bad too?

116
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:51,034
I wasn't watching anybody.

117
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:55,034
I was trying to feel it for myself.

118
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,634
Surely that's allowed?

119
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,873
I can't say whether
you were good or bad.

120
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:09,588
What are you writing?
That I was good or bad or...?

121
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,252
I write that you were...

122
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,257
Bad.

123
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:33,601
You can sleep here if you want.
There's enough room.

124
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,010
I'm not going to sleep here.

125
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,074
I'd just like to sit a while.

126
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,319
I thought Jeppe was good.

127
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:50,420
- Where the hell was Jeppe good?
- He was good by the machine.

128
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:54,592
He did fuck all by the machine.
Fuck all.

129
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,431
I know.
That was what was so cool.

130
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:01,098
A quick summary of what we were at?

131
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,906
No, an understandable summary.
I've heard 17 different versions.

132
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:08,843
A quick summary? They wanted
to fuck as many as possible...

133
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,975
as quickly as possible.
Isn't that so, Axel?

134
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:19,053
Axel says it was his idea.
I think it was Stoffer's.

135
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:23,425
It was my idea,
but it was Stoffer...

136
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,431
who wanted
to do something about it.

137
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:30,231
That's funny. None of the others
say it was your idea.

138
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,533
How come? None of them!

139
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,768
Would Stoffer
also say it was a game?

140
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,711
No. I don't think so.

141
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,908
- But it was?
- Yes, it was, really.

142
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,970
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Honey.

143
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:18,408
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

144
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,975
Axel, you have a visitor.

145
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:26,515
- Actually, it's Katrine.
- Oh, shit.

146
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,958
- Hi.
- Hi, Katrine.

147
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:34,925
Is there something I've got wrong?
You didn't go to Jutland?

148
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,094
Sure.
I've been to Jutland.

149
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:41,368
Because I thought
this spassing about was pathetic.

150
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:45,343
- So what the hell are you back for?
- I've changed my mind.

151
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:48,642
- "Changed your mind"?
- Yes. Is that wrong?

152
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:52,981
You might have come
to get me back again, right?

153
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:56,954
What the hell would I see in you, man?

154
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:00,618
- Oh, Katrine...
- You think very highly of yourself.

155
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,422
Quit touching me.

156
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,624
Your lies are pouring out
of every hole in your body.

157
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,690
- What's your problem?
- No problem.

158
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,294
If that's the way you feel,
come on.

159
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,965
You want to go outside? Fine.

160
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,034
Stoffer!

161
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,401
Axel is telling me to beat it.

162
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:23,711
Pretty weird
when I've come to spass.

163
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,719
- She's come back to get at me.
- Who has?

164
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,722
Three guesses.
Say something to her.

165
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:37,161
Katrine, have you come to spass
or have you come to get Axel back?

166
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,721
I've come to spass.

167
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,734
What are you doing, Jeppe?

168
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,108
I'm tying this up...
First round the lake.

169
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:57,377
No, out of the lake,
round the palm tree, into the lake.

170
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:01,682
I'm not coming if anyone's
going to be rough or silly.

171
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,985
It's slippery and dangerous
and you can fall and get hurt.

172
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,017
You mean it's slippery
at the public pool?

173
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,825
Axel, are you going to be rough?

174
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,391
- Round the lake...
- Don't look at me.

175
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,231
I know fuck all about knots.

176
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,436
- Heck!
- There's a knot in it.

177
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,998
Why all this scout shit?

178
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,980
Who is minder today?
You're minder yesterday.

179
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:34,042
- Round the palm, into the lake.
- The palm? What's that?

180
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,249
- What do you think?
- Listen up!

181
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,781
It's crazy if I'm the only one
who ever minds.

182
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,487
It's unrealistic.

183
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:46,589
- Josephine can't even mind herself.
- Thanks a bunch!

184
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,827
Karen, what about you?

185
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,265
Would you?
- Yeah, Karen!

186
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:05,214
Why are you undoing it again?
Stop... stop it!

187
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,810
I'll tie it up.
Get into the car.

188
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,118
Round the damned palm
and out of the bloody lake.

189
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,783
No, into the lake.

190
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:16,124
- Right then.
- It's not very tight.

191
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,521
You're driving me fucking bonkers.

192
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,534
- They're going.
- Round the lake...

193
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:26,561
Out of the lake, round the palm tree,
into the lake again.

194
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,750
I'd rather not help poke fun.

195
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,839
Hey lads, will you lend me a hand?

196
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,778
- Has it broken?
- I can't figure it out.

197
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:16,654
Katrine, we've got to talk.
I've a wife and a kid.

198
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,656
It won't do.

199
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,716
What do you want?

200
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,728
Maybe I bought it a size too small.

201
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:28,461
In the boutique, it fitted like a dream.

202
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:37,700
You want me?
Out of the question.

203
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:42,442
- It's impossible.
- Give her the ball.

204
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,312
That's right.

205
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,375
You are the most vicious cunt
I've ever come across.

206
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:54,556
Hey! Stop trying it on.

207
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,653
- I felt you feeling up my back.
- I wasn't.

208
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,425
You were too.

209
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,160
If I do this to you,
can't you feel it?

210
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:06,160
Ped? Ped? They're... Ped?

211
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,901
Don't make passes at me
or I'll call my husband.

212
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:26,080
Go to the men's changing room
at the other end.

213
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,293
Stoffer, let go.
Let go, all right?

214
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,620
Yes, it's Stoffer's willy.
Turn round, Stoffer.

215
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,287
There.

216
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:05,785
When I think about Karen,
I think of...

217
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:14,000
How do you say it in Danish?
A puppy? A little animal.

218
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:20,135
Maybe she stayed out of defiance.
I don't know.

219
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:26,048
It turned out that Karen
really needed us badly.

220
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:34,983
- Why do they do it?
- That's a bloody good question.

221
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:39,396
They're searching
for their inner idiot, Karen.

222
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:45,063
What's the idea of a society
that gets richer and richer

223
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:48,004
when it doesn't make anyone happier?

224
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:54,604
In the stone age, right?

225
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,547
All the idiots died.

226
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:03,086
It doesn't have to be
like that nowadays.

227
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,924
Being an idiot...

228
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:13,194
is a luxury
but it is also a step forward.

229
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,631
Idiots are the people of the future.

230
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:20,133
If one can find the one idiot
that happens to be one's own idiot...

231
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,841
Miguel, right?

232
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:28,869
He is a happy idiot.
Because he is a happy man.

233
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,384
But there are people who really are ill.

234
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:43,093
It's sad for the people
who are not able like us.

235
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:54,568
How can... how can you justify
acting the idiots?

236
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,372
You can't.

237
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:09,313
I would just like to... understand.

238
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,821
- I mean...
- Understand what?

239
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:20,531
Why I'm here.
Why I am here.

240
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:26,367
Perhaps because
there is a little idiot in there...

241
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:30,535
that wants to come out
and have some company.

242
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,873
Don't you think?

243
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,834
Got the sun lotion?
Did you bring it?

244
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:10,709
- No... you think it'll tan today?
- It always tans.

245
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,352
Thanks.

246
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:29,698
After the steps,
it's downhill all the way.

247
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,498
How's the wind?

248
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,712
That way!

249
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:46,239
Your style, Jeppe!
Yeah!

250
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:01,989
Stop! I'm not having it.
Look how far down it is.

251
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:05,764
- Now, Jeppe, now!
- Stop it, Miguel!

252
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,236
What did you feel for Jeppe?

253
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,045
Very nice.

254
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,225
Would you like to phone him?

255
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:39,526
- Now?
- Yes. Have you talked to him since?

256
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,533
- No.
- Would you like to?

257
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,900
I don't know,
I don't talk to any of the others.

258
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,134
From the group.

259
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,801
Why not?

260
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:58,243
Yes, they were a family.

261
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:04,721
I... Yes, they were, damn it.

262
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,750
I was on the outside.
But not emotionally.

263
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,387
Because I loved them all.
And they know it.

264
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:15,729
Maybe we just weren't so strong
together as we thought.

265
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:22,603
Stoffer, damn it.
Axel is smashing the shed windows.

266
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:27,812
Let him. Sheds are bourgeois crap.

267
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:32,408
Smashing windows is obviously
part of Axel's inner idiot.

268
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,918
There is also a man.

269
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,547
- What?
- A man.

270
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,216
Fine, Miguel.

271
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:43,660
- He says he is your uncle.
- Svend?

272
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:46,664
- That's what he said, yes.
- When did he arrive?

273
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,758
- Just now.
- Has he met anyone?

274
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,998
- Were they spassing?
- No, everyone's asleep.

275
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,165
Thank God. It's his damned house.

276
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:58,073
I thought it was yours?

277
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:03,069
Well, it is in a way.
I'm borrowing it till it's sold.

278
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,984
Hi, Svend.

279
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,853
These floors, right...

280
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:21,127
They were waxed every day.
Every day for fifty years.

281
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,294
- Every day, pal!
- Wow. bloody hell.

282
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:27,964
- Are they living here?
- Living? No...

283
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,975
- But they're asleep.
- I invited them.

284
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:34,308
To help shine the place up a bit.

285
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,677
They're qualified craftsmen.

286
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:41,812
How interesting...
that you know so many craftsmen.

287
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:46,313
What snobbery, uncle! Craftsman's kids
attend the best schools now.

288
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,222
- That's Jeppe.
- Yes?

289
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,252
He does the garden.

290
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:59,701
- And the flagstones.
- The flagstones too?

291
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:11,381
- Did you get the For Sale sign?
- Yes, it was just what we needed.

292
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:18,053
Know what?

293
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,990
You'd better take this seriously.

294
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,153
Or I'll find someone else to sell it.
You know that, right?

295
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:27,892
- What kind of craftsman is he?
- A glazier.

296
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,731
Luckily, as a couple of the shed
windows are broken...

297
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:36,298
We're thinking of putting hardened
glass in all the way round.

298
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,106
- Drive carefully.
- Not on your life.

299
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:08,765
We're so happy here.

300
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:14,911
I have no right to be so happy.

301
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,574
Oh, you have.

302
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,745
Of course, you have.

303
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:30,225
You're allowed to be here
and you're allowed to be happy.

304
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,857
- Do you believe me?
- Yes.

305
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:55,418
Hello, we're from a commune for
the mentally handicapped up the road.

306
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,395
Hello... is your mummy in?

307
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:13,061
Hello, we've some
Christmas decorations for sale.

308
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:19,138
- Want one?
- No, thanks.

309
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:22,613
How much are they?

310
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,581
Ped, how much are they?

311
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,377
$80.

312
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,548
- And five cents.
- They're not cheap.

313
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,990
What shall we say, then?

314
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,892
- $600.
- And five cents.

315
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:48,234
- They cost $2.
- And five cents.

316
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,774
Let's hope it lasts.

317
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,280
Look, we made $2.

318
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:07,917
- And five cents.
- Yes, and five cents.

319
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,691
We've debased ourselves enough
in this shitty district.

320
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:22,997
You'd better come outside,
there's been an accident in your drive.

321
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,875
- Is it serious?
- I think you may say so.

322
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:31,871
The retards were out selling
and they fell over.

323
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:35,977
You're in a spot.
Your running stones aren't flat.

324
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,045
- "Running stones"?!
- Yes.

325
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,319
They're far too high.

326
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:46,825
- Yes, but...
- Sulked... sulking...

327
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,731
- A bloody mess.
I hope you are insured.

328
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:52,930
Insured?

329
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,836
Is anybody hurt?

330
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,340
"ls anyone hurt"?

331
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:06,316
Well, I mean...

332
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,109
Are you sure it was the cobbles?

333
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,349
Are you saying they drag their feet?

334
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,723
- That they're clumsy?
- No, no...

335
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,957
That they're too clumsy
to cross your cobbles?

336
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,830
- Sulk...
- Shut up, Jeppe.

337
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:26,435
Nobody will buy these now.
They're completely fucked.

338
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,365
You've spoiled things
for the retards.

339
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,171
- How much are they?
- $4.

340
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,974
- Each.
- And five cents...

341
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,976
Society doesn't pay to keep them...

342
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,454
so they can bust their tails
on your running stones.

343
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:46,150
You've forgotten one.

344
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:50,290
Man... man... man.

345
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:54,494
Why Christmas decorations?
Why the humiliation?

346
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,831
No wonder people
who are already head cases...

347
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,269
get a distorted picture of reality.

348
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,941
Would you rather make kites?

349
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:20,190
- What's this?
- Quite. What's this?

350
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:24,558
I'm Vibeke and I talked to your uncle
about the house.

351
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:28,292
It is this house that's for sale?
There's no sign...

352
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,527
and there's usually a sign?

353
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:34,026
It must have fallen down.
We must put it up again.

354
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,233
Unless I can sell to you.

355
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:39,300
It's a cute house, isn't it?

356
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:42,005
Though it needs a bit of work.

357
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:47,075
Who'd move into anything today
and not chuck in a couple of million?

358
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,676
That's true.

359
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,622
- This will be removed.
- OK. It's not a fixture and fitting?

360
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,786
- No.
- We should be so lucky.

361
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:57,852
Stop it!

362
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:01,922
There is one little minus.

363
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:05,197
- Oh? What can that be?
- I have to mention it.

364
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:08,967
There is an institution
just down the road.

365
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:14,645
- An institution?
- An institution for the retarded.

366
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:22,212
I thought Soelleroed Town Hall
had a policy in that respect?

367
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,517
A policy?

368
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:29,458
Of not mixing residential areas and...

369
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,553
...institutions.

370
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:36,031
I just thought... I don't know...

371
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,865
My husband and l
have been abroad a lot.

372
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,235
One comes home
and things have moved so fast, eh?

373
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:43,206
Of not mixing...

374
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:48,235
Residential areas, private areas
with institutions...

375
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:52,306
Oh that kind of policy?
No, it's a myth. I think.

376
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,944
- How little we know!
- It's not on nowadays.

377
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:59,150
No, no, goodness, no.
It's just a bit of old nonsense.

378
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:05,026
The other people who've been
to see the house seemed to object.

379
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:08,327
- To what?
- The institution down the road.

380
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:11,096
- Oh, yes.
- A peculiar way of thinking.

381
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:14,730
But one does meet such people,
even today.

382
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:19,368
- Most peculiar.
- It is rather an old house.

383
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,813
Where is it, precisely?
Is it far?

384
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:27,443
- It's next door.
- Your next door neighbours.

385
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,715
Yes... and they've been coming here
a bit...

386
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:33,349
while the house has been empty.
Of course, that can stop.

387
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:39,523
But the retards like picking nuts.
They pick nuts in the autumn.

388
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:47,402
But you have no objection to...
the mentally handicapped?

389
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:51,534
Objections to the mentally handicapped?
Of course not.

390
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:55,706
I think it's fascinating.
It's fascinating to follow...

391
00:36:55,746 --> 00:37:00,206
... to follow people like that.
I follow them a lot...

392
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,379
when I see there's a documentary
on TV...

393
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:07,482
it interests me a lot.
Their behaviour is far more innocent...

394
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:11,655
My husband had... at one time...
a cousin...

395
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:15,063
who married into a family with
mentally retarded. Or he had a...

396
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,659
Your cousin was married to a retard?

397
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:22,264
- No, no. He wasn't married to one.
- Would you like to meet them?

398
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,935
- They've come for a cup of tea.
- They're here now?

399
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:29,538
They do pop in now and then.
Wouldn't that be nice?

400
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,048
Damn it, yes.

401
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:37,678
- We'll meet a couple, then go.
- Susanne, line up the retards.

402
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:41,818
- Our new neighbors want to say hi.
- It's a lovely site.

403
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:46,660
- Come and say hi to the lady.
- Say hi to your new neighbors.

404
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,359
Finn has got a cousin who's a retard.

405
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,268
- So you know what it's like.
- Say hello nicely.

406
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:56,239
Actually, Finn's cousin is...
oh, never mind.

407
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,402
We could start by saying
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

408
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,934
- For what?
- For using the garden.

409
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:06,313
They so much need fresh air
and we haven't many possibilities.

410
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,818
Can we go on coming?

411
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:12,789
- Coming here, I mean.
- Yes, no problem.

412
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:17,089
- That's really kind of you.
- We didn't even dare to hope...

413
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,653
Did you hear that?
We can use their garden.

414
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,394
Use it like crazy.

415
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:28,997
Where zayn? Where zayn?

416
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,976
The Seine? The Seine's in Paris.
Nice meeting you...

417
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,207
I could fetch a bit of paper...

418
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:39,546
It's a bit soon for paper.
We've things to do first.

419
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,017
But we'll be seeing you, right?

420
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:46,046
We'll see you
before I can count to ten.

421
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,581
See you!Definitely!

422
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,423
Bye-bye!

423
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,159
Bye-bye, Vibeke.

424
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:59,636
- Well Karen, we've sold the house.
- Have they bought the house?

425
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,537
No, definitely not.

426
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,633
He's just having you on.

427
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:11,876
I thought they were all very nice.
Jeppe was...

428
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,908
Interesting to hear that they were nice.

429
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:17,819
The idea doesn't seem... polite.

430
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,585
No, but...

431
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,830
No, you could put it that way.

432
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,299
No, no, no, Ped!

433
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:38,239
- Hi.
- Hi. Smile, everyone.

434
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,402
What's your name?

435
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:50,883
Shall we find some sodas and stuff?
Would you like that?

436
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,946
That's a good idea.

437
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,752
- Well, old bean.
- You're still young.

438
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:04,165
Will you pass me a soda?
If there are any left?

439
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:14,075
Please leave me alone...

440
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:21,208
- It's a bit crooked.
- Would you like to buy one?

441
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,083
No.

442
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,329
What are you doing?

443
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:36,163
- I'm here on vacation.
- On vacation?

444
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,794
On vacation?

445
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,703
What the fuck am I meant to say?

446
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,908
- Are you on vacation?
- What the hell am I meant to say?

447
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,811
What's with him?

448
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:04,784
- All this sentimental crap...
- What's wrong with that?

449
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,956
It's lovely.
They're cute.

450
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:10,160
- Cute?
- Yes.

451
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,693
Cute? You haven't got
the slightest fucking idea.

452
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:17,764
About what? They're visiting
and they like it here.

453
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,072
What's that?

454
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:23,371
- A camera.
- What for?

455
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:26,383
I was wondering
if one might take a photo.

456
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:29,750
A photo? You want to take
a photo of them?

457
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:33,052
Hey, let's measure
their skulls and gas them.

458
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,617
This is great. It's just a pity
we can't capture their genes on film.

459
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,891
Henrik has a camera.
May he take a photo of you?

460
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,057
Yes!

461
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:45,933
Hold his hand.
He'd be so pleased.

462
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,804
You're all looking great.
Except you, Henrik. Smile!

463
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,398
Henrik, Smile.

464
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:06,314
Yes, they were highly credible.

465
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,918
They were really good at it.

466
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:15,455
One has to be able to look
other people in the face afterwards.

467
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:18,662
That one can...

468
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:24,165
That one doesn't take the piss
out of people the whole time.

469
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:31,178
Any retards out here?

470
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,543
Shut up, Nana.

471
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:41,250
Cooee! Miguel?

472
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:45,126
I get all jumpy without you drooling
over me all day.

473
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:50,122
Where's Jeppe the retard?
What's the matter with you?

474
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,568
They really got to you, didn't they?

475
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:57,033
Wow, it's great to be here.

476
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:15,053
Karen?

477
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,429
Oh, Karen, damn it!
Susanne?

478
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,768
Karen's gone into spass.
Karen's gone into spass.

479
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:47,652
Karen, come on, it's lovely.
Lovely water. Come on.

480
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:50,023
Is it lovely?

481
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,621
Look, you're floating
all by yourself.

482
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:42,506
Axel speaking.
I'm at baby swimming, damn it.

483
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:47,609
You can't fire me for paternity leave
when I'm actually on it.

484
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:55,790
You look like a dickhead in that, Axel.

485
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:57,851
Dressed to kill.

486
00:44:58,162 --> 00:44:59,993
When are we going to talk?

487
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:04,262
- I've got to pop into the agency.
- What for?

488
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:07,930
I've got to work on a pay-off.
A slogan.

489
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:11,270
I have to wear my best gear
to see the best people...

490
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,401
and win the best customers.

491
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:16,470
- I don't see why you have to go.
- To work.

492
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:18,242
We're trying to steal a client
from another agency.

493
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:22,946
Benedikte. Scandinavia's biggest
powdered food manufacturer.

494
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,477
When are we going to talk?

495
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:29,959
- When I'm through.
- When will that be?

496
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:33,656
When she slips of the hook
or when we land her.

497
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:36,996
- Any time you like, Babe.
- I would like...

498
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:41,061
But not now.
I'm just so fucking busy.

499
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:43,266
- When I get back.
- Promise?

500
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:45,275
- We'll talk all you want.
- Promise?

501
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:49,939
- Yes, I promise.
- But you have a wife and baby.

502
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,542
That's history. Can you imagine me
pushing a pram? I'd go crazy.

503
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,746
It's so fucking middle class.

504
00:45:56,787 --> 00:46:00,655
I don't want a wife and kid.
I want you.

505
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:14,736
Whoops. Here comes reality.

506
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,771
I'll be back in a jiffy.

507
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:23,506
Bye, Sugar.

508
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,310
Oh, Katrine!

509
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,955
You wade right into it,
with both legs.

510
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,624
What did he want with her?

511
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:49,264
To screw, shag, fuck, make love.

512
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:52,036
- All four?
- All four.

513
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:57,536
Katrine claims you held
some very anti-middle-class views.

514
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:01,244
- Or ideologies.
- I do.

515
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:05,380
What's up, darling?

516
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:11,258
Based on what?
Your ideologies?

517
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:13,286
- "Anti-middle-class ideologies"?
- Yes.

518
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:21,330
Mainly that there is something
more than meaningfulness.

519
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:24,272
And purposefulness.

520
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:28,870
Oh? She made it sound like
something to do with the family.

521
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:32,245
Katrine played a few tricks on Axel,
I've heard.

522
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,852
Yes, but damn it, they were...

523
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:43,622
more in the
land-him-in-the-shit genre.

524
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,064
A Corporation is a Religion.

525
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:53,092
"Child's Food".

526
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,931
What the fuck do you mean by that?

527
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:01,502
It's the pay-off.
Child's Food.

528
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,445
CHlLD'S FOOD

529
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:10,386
It means it's easy.
It's food...

530
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,413
and it's so easy that even a child
can make it.

531
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,483
I'd fucking well figured that out.

532
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:20,622
But the company does actually
make children's foods.

533
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:23,497
- I didn't know that.
- You didn't know that?

534
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:27,469
You should have checked
before coming up with such crap.

535
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:29,495
A pathetic slip of paper.

536
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:33,669
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
CHlLD'S FOOD

537
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,803
- Is it me personally you don't like?
- No.

538
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:40,510
They're using Hjart at the moment
and they know it's hopeless.

539
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,917
But you've stoked
Benedikte's fires nicely.

540
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:46,445
On the phone she sounds ready.

541
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:49,323
She's crazy for you.
For some reason.

542
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,886
I've made some flashy folders
with charts and all.

543
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,923
They're for another product,
and she won't look at them anyway.

544
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:01,370
But when you come up
with crap like that...

545
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:11,878
It's known as baby food,
not child's food.

546
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:15,043
So "Child's Food" can easily
be the pay-off...

547
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:17,986
for someone who makes baby food.

548
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,717
Quite sophisticated, really.

549
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,225
- Baby food, child's food.
- Baby food, child's food.

550
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:28,357
Bloody hell.

551
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:31,333
She's here.
I'll go and talk to her first.

552
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:35,236
Then you come in with Svendsen.
And Severin, to be on the safe side.

553
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:39,265
But whatever she says today,
keep your balls in the air.

554
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,836
"Child's food", for fuck's sake.

555
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,164
- Svendsen.
- Benedikte.

556
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,895
- Severin.
- And you know each other.

557
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:08,701
- No.
- We haven't had much time.

558
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:13,472
But sometimes that's what it takes.
A deadline...

559
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:17,543
Axel, will you show us what you've got?

560
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:22,210
Axel?

561
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,147
Problems?

562
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:32,960
If you're worried about taking
a client from another agency...

563
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:35,123
No, it's not that.

564
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:39,295
Axel, show us what you've got.
Even if it's provisional.

565
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:46,542
Ah, an itty-bitty wee thing.

566
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:49,443
Child's Food...

567
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,285
If I read you right...

568
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:07,695
you are favourably disposed
towards... toward Child's Food.

569
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:13,670
- I think it's... bloody good.
- Fine.

570
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:18,504
We have a luxury problem.

571
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:22,273
It could be too sophisticated.

572
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:25,440
It might be confused
with children's food.

573
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:29,277
- Children... baby...
- It's sophisticated.

574
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:42,228
- Would you like a glass of water?
- Yes, please.

575
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:49,230
Have you got a colour printer?

576
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:53,208
If you like these colours,
we'll keep them.

577
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:58,304
May I ask the kind of...
we... figure...

578
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:03,047
I mean how much money
are we talking about for the campaign?

579
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:08,683
20 million?

580
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,722
That would be with the buses and all.

581
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:18,700
No, the buses would come on top.

582
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,110
- Axel?
- Excuse me.

583
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:33,480
I think Benedikte and l
will take a stroll.

584
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:37,078
- Come along, Benedikte.
- Need any help?

585
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:45,194
Enjoying yourself?

586
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:47,321
I'm loving it.

587
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:49,229
Get out of here.

588
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:52,201
Phone and say you haven't the authority.

589
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:54,567
But not that the pay-off sucks.

590
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:57,573
But it does suck.
That tiny bit of paper...

591
00:52:57,607 --> 00:52:59,472
How the hell did you get in?

592
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:02,967
"Child's Food..."
How do you think these things up?

593
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:06,513
Is that what you do here?
I'm amazed.

594
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,885
- It's incredible
- Get out, Katrine.

595
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,788
OK, OK, I'm out of here.
Card, please.

596
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:18,188
- No way.
- OK. We'll continue the meeting.

597
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:24,257
See you.
is this the way out?

598
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:37,006
OK. We've talked about that now.
But why are you lying to me?

599
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,776
- I'm not.
- You are!

600
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:42,512
You say you didn't hump Katrine,
but I know you did.

601
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:46,181
If you want to be so liberated
and unprejudiced...

602
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:49,624
you have to admit
you humped the bitch.

603
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:53,322
- That's not what it's about.
- It is! You're lying.

604
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:55,354
It just isn't.

605
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:15,615
Hey, don't stare at strangers.

606
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:19,819
Excuse my brother,
he's soft in the head.

607
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:24,316
It's the tattoos, man.
He likes them.

608
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:29,221
Is it, Jeppe?
Is it the tattoos?

609
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:33,800
Look... Iook...

610
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,568
Would you like to sit down, Jeppe?

611
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:47,007
Would you like that?

612
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:50,014
Sit down.
You're allowed.

613
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:05,901
Good for you, meeting
such nice people, eh, Jeppe?

614
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:10,565
You'll really have a tale to tell
the other patients.

615
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:17,606
I have to use the cashpoint.

616
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:21,310
Would you mind keeping an eye
on my brother till I get back?

617
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:25,955
- Sure, that'd be OK.
- I'll only be ten minutes.

618
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:33,519
Watch that arm, Guv.

619
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:36,326
- Is he allowed to drink?
- Yeah.

620
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,868
- Easy does it.
- Cheers, Jeppe.

621
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:48,707
He may get beaten up,
you realize?

622
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,713
No, they don't hit retards.

623
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:54,046
They will if they discover
he's taking the piss.

624
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:57,850
He'll just have to play the part, then.
It'll do him good.

625
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:00,521
He may learn something.

626
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,437
Hey, Jeppe...
are you clocking Linda?

627
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:24,106
Eh? Have you taken a shine to Linda?

628
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:27,139
No... no...

629
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:37,125
Where the hell is he going?
... Hey, you!

630
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:41,153
Maybe he's just stretching his legs.

631
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:44,189
You've got to stay here.

632
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:49,770
- Where was he going?
- No idea.

633
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:52,070
Were you trying to escape from us?

634
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:59,438
- He needs a piss, that's what it is.
- He needs a piss.

635
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:03,479
Look...

636
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:09,124
Right, then.

637
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:20,200
Out with the bastard
so we can get it over with.

638
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,735
Not much going on there.

639
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,401
Of course.
They can't piss by themselves.

640
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:34,645
Maybe he needs a hand.

641
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,311
There.

642
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:41,883
- Right.
- Drain the spuds then.

643
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,888
Turn the tap on, it usually works.

644
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,295
Come on.

645
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,136
Come on.

646
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:00,273
Come on.

647
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,471
A man' got to go
when a man's got to go.

648
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:03,501
Not much action going on.

649
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:05,104
Come on.

650
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:10,049
Come on!

651
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,852
- And old trick.
- That's better.

652
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:25,467
Why are you washing his hands?
He never touched his dick.

653
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:31,463
I was beginning to think
you'd taken him for a chopper ride.

654
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:33,799
Maybe he'd like to ride Linda?

655
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:38,474
Say good-bye
and thank you to the kind people.

656
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,506
See you around.

657
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,347
Jeppe!

658
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:46,854
Come here! Jeppe!
Jeppe, damn it!

659
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:49,215
Come back!

660
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,759
Stoffer...

661
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:59,062
I thought you were horrid to Jeppe.

662
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:02,897
He's just being a dweeb.
He's always been like that.

663
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,537
Boring cunt!

664
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:07,242
Sorry...
Though I don't know why.

665
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:10,269
What you did was really mean.

666
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:14,545
I don't get it.
It's so lovely here.

667
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:18,454
Why is there so much
getting at people?

668
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:22,317
- What good does it do?
- Hear that, Stoffer?

669
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:25,685
Karen says all this
is just for getting at people.

670
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:31,657
Hey, aren't you having a hard time!
Why do you stay here, then?

671
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:40,835
- Yes, I am a real fucking bastard.
- Not compared to me.

672
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:44,170
You're not a bastard,
you're just egocentric.

673
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,849
I'm a bastard to everyone I know.
To Katrine, to my wife...

674
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,920
Oh, no!

675
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:00,596
You passed hard enough to spass
Iranian caviar off the shelf?

676
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:07,869
- I've seen it, thanks.
- 1 80$? That's insane.

677
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:09,732
Crazy!

678
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:13,203
Why are you poking at it?

679
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:17,805
We're in Soelleroed, damn it.

680
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:21,347
At least eat it
the way they eat caviar in Soelleroed.

681
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:31,184
If you can spass with yogurt
you can spass with caviar.

682
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:37,765
That's expensive stuff.

683
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,299
There are people starving...

684
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:47,037
There aren't any people starving.
... That's the whole trick.

685
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:54,372
- I'd like to borrow the phone.
- Stoffer, here's 70 bucks' worth.

686
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:18,799
Stoffer, there's a man from
Soelleroed Town Hall to see you.

687
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,135
From town hall?

688
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,607
Hello there.

689
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:28,844
I have a solution to your problem.

690
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,816
You have a solution to our problem?

691
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:35,087
What problem?

692
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:39,388
I don't know if
I've chosen the right words.

693
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,423
But to boil it down to its essence -

694
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:49,765
- we have an agreement with
a distinct across town, Hvidavre...

695
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:53,899
It might be advantageous to you.

696
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:57,208
Hvidavre?

697
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:04,081
I can't tell you officially
that I can promise you a grant

698
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:10,214
if you decide to transfer your
private home for the handicapped.

699
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,258
But the chances are good.

700
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:15,992
If we transfer our home
for the handicapped

701
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:23,638
from Soelleroed to Hvidavre,
we'll get a large sum of money?

702
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:27,902
- Not officially, but...
- But?

703
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:32,673
- Yes, you can count on it.
- You know what I think of that?

704
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:39,049
I think it's quite fantastic.
It's damned good of you.

705
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:42,190
Well, it's not me personally,
it's town hall.

706
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:47,720
Town hall thought out that
we'd run into financial problems...

707
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,194
Who doesn't?

708
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,901
And you drop in
like manna from heaven!

709
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:56,894
Hi, Miguel... say hello
to the man from town hall.

710
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:02,475
What's the matter with him?

711
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:05,010
He's suffering from delusions.

712
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:10,442
We've three Napoleons here.

713
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:13,215
- Does that still go on?
- Yes, sadly.

714
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:16,323
We've tried to eradicate it, but...

715
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:20,257
You can imagine how much
we spend on food alone.

716
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:26,825
What's he so sad about?

717
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:32,168
Miguel, can you tell the guy
from town hall why you're so sad?

718
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:36,607
Waterloo.

719
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:39,243
Waterloo?

720
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:47,249
We really appreciate
your coming all the way out here.

721
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:53,920
No! Axel, you're not pissing
on an official vehicle again?

722
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:58,692
I'm sorry: have you any
jumper cables I could borrow?

723
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:02,359
Has he pissed on
an official vehicle again?

724
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:04,869
I'm really sorry.
He doesn't mean it personally.

725
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:08,434
It's a cure we have.
We call it the Soelleroed cure.

726
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,476
He's got to learn.

727
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:16,050
The red one on the right, Ped.
The black on the left.

728
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:19,653
We'll give him shock therapy,
the fucking retard.

729
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,357
Rev up, damn it!

730
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:30,797
You'll need the police
and dogs to get us out.

731
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:33,765
Soelleroed fascists!

732
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:37,497
Fascist pricks!
Soelleroed fascists!

733
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,374
Fucking fascists!

734
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:45,609
Cock suckers!

735
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:50,217
Town hall bastards!
Soelleroed fascists!

736
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:55,421
Shithead!
Soelleroed fascist!

737
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:58,082
Fucking Soelleroed fascists!

738
01:04:58,294 --> 01:05:02,196
- You're stark raving mad.
- Fascist bastard!

739
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:06,128
Fucking fascists!

740
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:08,269
Calm down, Stoffer.

741
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:15,739
Get him into the bus.

742
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:18,971
Gently does it..

743
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:20,980
I think he's hurt.

744
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,846
Fucking fascists...

745
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:27,681
Stoffer, calm down.

746
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:31,053
That will fucking well do, Stoffer.
Come on.

747
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,933
Up to bed.

748
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,273
- You can't haul him up there.
- You're pathetic.

749
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:50,502
Are you putting me
in the padded cell?

750
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:55,140
You are so fucking pathetic.

751
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:58,945
You are really zinging.
You need to relax.

752
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:02,151
Nana, will you get him a blanket?

753
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:04,557
Can't we put him
in an ordinary bed?

754
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:10,131
- Stoffer, we have to tie you down.
- You think I've gone really mad?

755
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:11,960
Are you scared now?

756
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:16,164
- Listen...
- I won't hit anyone.

757
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:19,170
You did before.

758
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:23,108
I'm not the type who hits people.

759
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:26,440
- OK, OK.
- I don't hit people.

760
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:30,913
Want a drink?

761
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:35,286
Untie that one.

762
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:39,226
Fucking fascists!
Soelleroed fascists!

763
01:06:39,428 --> 01:06:40,986
Soelleroed fascists!

764
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:43,290
- Stop it!
- Where's the belt?

765
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:46,127
Out of the lake,
round the palm tree, into the lake.

766
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:49,065
- Surely it's not that difficult?
- Not so hard.

767
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:53,235
- Stop it, Stoffer.
- Fascists, man.

768
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:55,171
Chill out!

769
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:13,685
We'll loosen the flex
and leave him here, OK?

770
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:28,608
And you miss the family?

771
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:34,509
I do, as a matter of fact.

772
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:39,984
I don't know how I figured that
I didn't want to see them again.

773
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:49,826
I just think it's over.

774
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:56,097
I don't think we can...
find the same fine things

775
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:00,872
that we found there.

776
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,605
We can't find them again.

777
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:06,240
I was the one who was
with Karen on the last day.

778
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:11,614
And I was the one
who said good-bye to her.

779
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:14,716
Music and dancing.

780
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:19,224
Lots of flags
to cheer him up.

781
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:31,599
Did you sleep well?

782
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:38,141
You might at least have
tied me to a decent bed.

783
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:42,741
- What are you doing?
- Making a party.

784
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:49,319
- We thought we need a party.
- A party?

785
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:52,461
We're going to have a party?

786
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:55,825
- That's right.
- For me?

787
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:58,056
Yes.

788
01:08:58,234 --> 01:09:00,065
Because it's my birthday?

789
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,700
It's not my real birthday.

790
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:07,433
Well, we're not real retards, are we?

791
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,603
May we come in?

792
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,975
Are you ready?
- Ticket.

793
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:22,148
Wow, what a rave!

794
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:28,490
Jeppe, look at the ticket
and tear it in half.

795
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:34,397
I'll do it, then... frrrt.
Now you can go in.

796
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:38,870
Come on...

797
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:51,547
Jeeze, things are really swinging.

798
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:58,489
We're the ones
The others can't play with

799
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:01,958
We're the ones
The others can't play with

800
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:10,066
I think Stoffer should choose
what we do next.

801
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:12,399
Because it's his party.

802
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:15,375
Gang bang.

803
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:19,241
No, listen, we've got picture lotto,
spin the bottle...

804
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:21,574
- Gang bang.
- I'll go for that.

805
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:24,719
Gang bang! Gang bang!

806
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:29,417
Sure! I'd love a spasser fuck.

807
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:32,219
Gang bang!

808
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:49,706
Gang bang...

809
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:52,814
Hey, hey, hey!

810
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:08,029
No, I'm not joining in.

811
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:13,167
Susanne!

812
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:16,933
- Come on...
- No.

813
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:19,937
Yes... Gang bang!

814
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:22,872
- Susanne.
- They're my knickers.

815
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:27,674
Go over there.
I'll sit and... Stop it, Stoffer.

816
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:30,717
- I can't undo my...
- Can't you?

817
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:36,581
Stop it!

818
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:45,927
Stoffer, I don't want to.

819
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:50,170
I'll go home.
I'm not having this.

820
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:54,108
I'm running away.
Home.

821
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:01,978
Stop it!
I'm going home!

822
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:04,313
Go away.
No!

823
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:08,614
Good-bye.

824
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:12,693
- Gang bang... Gang bang...
- Yes...

825
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:23,371
I'll give you gang bang!

826
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:25,871
Yes, Suzanne!

827
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:28,599
OK, I'll just take these off, too.

828
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:38,742
I'm ready and waiting.

829
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:45,816
Katrine? Want some?

830
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:55,273
I love you.

831
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:00,912
I love you.

832
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:54,368
The room was full of style
till you brought those Lilos.

833
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:58,604
They cost 7 bucks each.
- A four-poster would be better.

834
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,976
Ped! There's no
getting away from it.

835
01:17:03,018 --> 01:17:06,818
He smokes like hell, and it's
getting worse as he gets older.

836
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:20,396
- It's my father.
- Hello.

837
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:24,198
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello, Josephine.

838
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:28,866
This is Katrine and Ped and Axel.

839
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:32,377
- Hello.
- Would you like a cup of tea?

840
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:35,277
- Sit down.
- Yes, please.

841
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:44,459
- I'm Jeppe.
- Josy's father.

842
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:48,054
Stoffer... have a seat.

843
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:54,196
You just happened to be passing?

844
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:57,205
We have a little group.

845
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:01,565
A tired group.

846
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:05,509
- Do you take sugar?
- Thanks.

847
01:18:08,884 --> 01:18:11,785
We are a bit tired.

848
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:18,991
Maybe you've heard of our group?

849
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:21,990
No...

850
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:27,795
- No.
- Oh.

851
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:33,869
You make it sound like a rock band.

852
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:35,874
Maybe we should form one.

853
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:38,308
That would be a great idea.

854
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:42,609
What do you think?
Of us?

855
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:45,013
- What do I think of you?
- Yes.

856
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:48,889
Well...

857
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:55,459
They're nice people.
They enjoy what they do.

858
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:58,827
I'm sure they do.

859
01:18:59,034 --> 01:19:02,697
We're really, really happy.

860
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:20,250
Maybe you've heard
about our little...

861
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:24,687
I'm not interested
in discussing what you do.

862
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:28,227
I couldn't care less.

863
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:47,642
Couldn't care less?

864
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:55,113
If you could see things differently
you might see the beauty of them.

865
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:58,850
In vino veritas...

866
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:06,027
What the hell do you mean by that?
I may be right.

867
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:08,802
It doesn't interest me.

868
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:11,932
- It doesn't?
- No.

869
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:13,802
Why did you come, then?

870
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:23,076
Obviously an outsider
can't see what it means.

871
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:28,047
You should see some of
the wonderful things we're shared.

872
01:20:28,223 --> 01:20:31,351
People are happy.
They're thriving.

873
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:35,121
- They are!
- I'm not going to argue.

874
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:39,358
We're not arguing.
Ask anyone if they're happy.

875
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:42,897
Josephine is happy here.

876
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:49,033
- It certainly looks like it.
- That's because you're here.

877
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:53,442
She was fine until you came.
But then you came crashing in.

878
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:58,975
I am really happy here.

879
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:08,055
- I've come to take you home.
- No... you can't do that.

880
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:11,859
Yes.

881
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:15,459
Yes, I can.

882
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:27,314
- You see, I can't trust you.
- What do you mean?

883
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:30,011
- Bullshit.
- What do you mean?

884
01:21:30,185 --> 01:21:33,052
You haven't been taking your pills.

885
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:37,180
- We'd agreed she'd...
- I have been taking them.

886
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:43,320
Damn it, Josephine...
the jar was in the drawer at home.

887
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:46,832
I can't look after you unless...

888
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:50,335
Why should she take
a load of fucking pills?

889
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:52,472
I can't.

890
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:59,837
- You're going through hell.
- I'm not... I'm not.

891
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:14,661
For the first time,
I'm feeling really great.

892
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:25,432
Can't we find a compromise?

893
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:29,835
Listen...

894
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:33,509
- We're fond of Josephine.
- Listen!

895
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:38,779
We don't like you.
If you left there'd be no problem.

896
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:44,219
She doesn't look as if
she wants to go with you.

897
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,154
Listen...

898
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,627
This may be a game to you.

899
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:55,134
And good luck to you.

900
01:22:57,472 --> 01:23:02,409
But it takes nothing to make
Josephine seriously ill.

901
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:07,740
Keep your shirt on,
I'm a doctor, I'd never permit...

902
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:11,377
I don't think you're a doctor
I'd choose to go to.

903
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:13,280
I don't think so.

904
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:17,555
Come along, Josephine.

905
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:22,891
No, I don't want to go.

906
01:23:23,064 --> 01:23:27,694
If you've any bits and pieces,
pop upstairs and get them.

907
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:32,066
- I don't want to go home.
- Did you hear what I said?

908
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:35,136
Josephine...

909
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:39,412
Answer me... have you any?

910
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:42,812
- Yes.
- Go and get them, and we'll go.

911
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:54,693
What the fuck can he do to you?

912
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:57,957
Stay here!
All you have to do is say the word.

913
01:23:58,133 --> 01:23:59,725
He can't hurt you.

914
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:05,499
What right's he got?

915
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:14,371
- Ped, what were those pills?
- I know nothing about any pills.

916
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:18,680
Aren't you a doctor, damn it?
You said you knew about it.

917
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:23,256
- So what kind of pills is she on?
- I don't know.

918
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:26,519
- You must know.
- She never mentioned pills.

919
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:28,594
And she doesn't need pills.

920
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:32,726
Josephine, just stay!
He can't do anything to you.

921
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:35,730
Stay here!

922
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,809
- We can't force anybody to stay!
- He's forcing her!

923
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:45,673
It's their business.
We can't cure anyone here.

924
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:50,579
- That's not our aim.
- Aim? Up yours, man!

925
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:55,178
Josephine...
There should be a law against it.

926
01:24:57,892 --> 01:25:01,521
Get out of here!
She doesn't want to go with you.

927
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:06,723
If you'd really been a proper father
she'd have been all right today.

928
01:25:10,171 --> 01:25:13,538
We can't force anyone to stay
against their will.

929
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:16,206
Jeppe!

930
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:24,551
Jeppe...

931
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:28,015
Jeppe...

932
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:45,836
You're insane.
Insane in the head.

933
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:57,479
You're insane.

934
01:25:57,652 --> 01:26:01,144
What are you doing?

935
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:06,359
- Move him!
- We'll move him, damn you.

936
01:26:07,395 --> 01:26:09,226
No!

937
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:11,426
No!

938
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:15,862
Go now, damn you!

939
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:29,048
Please get out of the way.

940
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,659
No!

941
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,800
Deep breaths.

942
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:52,663
All the way down.
On your feet, now.

943
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:54,969
Stand back,
I know how to deal with this.

944
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:59,705
- Stop being so aggressive.
- You've no fucking idea. No idea.

945
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,381
Jeppe, baby...

946
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:23,226
Is there any booze in the house?

947
01:27:23,471 --> 01:27:27,373
Is there any left over from the...

948
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:31,911
- There's vodka in the cupboard.
- And beer in the bathtub.

949
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:40,115
Please stop doing your nails.
It kind of stresses me out.

950
01:27:43,224 --> 01:27:48,389
Dr. Doolittle is scribbling away
... it must be interesting, eh?

951
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:53,893
Will it result in a doctorate?

952
01:27:54,736 --> 01:27:57,967
- Maybe.
- Got lots of pearls of wisdom?

953
01:27:58,006 --> 01:28:00,702
And how about Henrik
the art teacher?

954
01:28:00,908 --> 01:28:03,638
Do you think your work's any good?

955
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:05,938
...It was an experiment.

956
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:10,574
- An experiment?
- I like the top one.

957
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:15,654
And you feel you'll be more of an artist
if you go a teeny bit mad?

958
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:19,554
But not too much.
Just enough to be a proper artist.

959
01:28:21,696 --> 01:28:24,324
You've no bloody talent
at any rate.

960
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:30,335
- It isn't the way I'd imagined it.
- You'd imagined it?

961
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:34,771
Your pathetic little spassing bit
is the only thing that matters.

962
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:38,939
If you'd opened your mouth outside,
she would have stayed.

963
01:28:39,113 --> 01:28:43,174
- But now he's upstairs screaming.
- She's right, Stoffer.

964
01:28:43,351 --> 01:28:48,687
Ped, Henrik, Jeppe and Josephine
are just as good retards as you.

965
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:51,654
Oh, now I've put my foot in it.

966
01:28:51,693 --> 01:28:53,752
I have no faith in you.

967
01:28:53,928 --> 01:28:58,092
The moment it starts hurting
just a bit, you cop out.

968
01:28:58,299 --> 01:29:03,202
Tell us what you expect of us, then.
Tell us what you want!

969
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:09,003
For you to prove that you are really
into the whole idea, Axel, prove it.

970
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:12,441
Sod off home and spass.

971
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:16,514
Freaking out in Soelleroed
in no big deal.

972
01:29:16,551 --> 01:29:19,782
If you can go back
to your families or jobs

973
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:23,685
and still be a spasser,
I'll believe you're serious.

974
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:27,123
- None of you has the guts.
- Listen...

975
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:32,665
Stoffer is mocking us.
Mocking the idiots.

976
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:37,498
Of course we can go home
and spass. Or spass at work.

977
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:45,146
Otherwise it's worthless.
Either you're an idiot or you aren't.

978
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:50,847
Who's going first?

979
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:59,393
Come on.
Whoever the bottle points at...

980
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:05,863
will go somewhere where
the people you're with really matter.

981
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:07,798
Shut up, Susanne,
this is important.

982
01:30:07,835 --> 01:30:11,236
Aren't you in on it?

983
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:13,030
And Jeppe and Karen?

984
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:17,803
I've never heard Karen boast
that she was a great spasser.

985
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:22,746
That's Jeppe. If it points
over there... or here, I'm it.

986
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:47,938
Fine, I'll go back to Mona
and the baby and spass.

987
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:51,044
Or to the agency.

988
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:56,884
In fact, that would be
really, really awful for you.

989
01:30:56,918 --> 01:30:59,352
You just promised, man.

990
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:08,962
You want me to flush my whole
family life down the toilet?

991
01:31:09,063 --> 01:31:11,054
Nobody's saying that.

992
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:16,499
Your sow of a wife will just have
to learn to love your inner idiot.

993
01:31:24,111 --> 01:31:25,840
I can't.

994
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:30,140
I can't.

995
01:31:47,268 --> 01:31:49,099
Axel?

996
01:31:49,637 --> 01:31:53,198
Come here a moment, Axel.

997
01:31:53,441 --> 01:31:56,308
Axel!

998
01:31:58,579 --> 01:32:01,309
Another spin of the bottle, then.

999
01:32:17,398 --> 01:32:19,366
Yes...

1000
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,474
When?

1001
01:32:41,055 --> 01:32:43,182
This is for you.
Welcome back.

1002
01:32:43,357 --> 01:32:44,984
Thanks.

1003
01:32:47,295 --> 01:32:51,356
Henrik, I have a little question.

1004
01:32:51,532 --> 01:32:54,524
Have we done the obelisks?

1005
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:59,336
- The obelisks? Oh, the Odalisques!
- Is he going to spass or what?

1006
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:01,634
He's doing fuck all.

1007
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:12,043
I think it's time
for us to consider...

1008
01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:14,145
the calligraphy in Matisse.

1009
01:33:14,322 --> 01:33:19,385
Primarily I mean
"Les fleurs du Mal", 1944.

1010
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,494
Oh, them? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1011
01:33:21,629 --> 01:33:24,928
Whether Matisse was
completely aware of his...

1012
01:33:25,066 --> 01:33:27,796
effect on the bourgeoisie.

1013
01:33:28,002 --> 01:33:32,632
He was certainly provocative
and full of surprises.

1014
01:33:32,807 --> 01:33:36,675
Nobody could accuse you of that.

1015
01:33:36,844 --> 01:33:38,607
I need some air.

1016
01:33:38,679 --> 01:33:40,374
- Hello!
- Yes?

1017
01:33:40,548 --> 01:33:45,781
What's going on? Fuck all.
You love this middle-class crap.

1018
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:51,186
These old dames use more
make-up than the National Theatre.

1019
01:33:57,698 --> 01:34:03,034
It's lovely to have Henrik back,
don't you think?

1020
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:17,975
What happened?

1021
01:34:20,955 --> 01:34:26,018
We didn't come to hear about
a French faggot and his calligraphy.

1022
01:34:26,193 --> 01:34:27,956
It's too fucking bad.

1023
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:32,629
- I tried.
- You coughed three times.

1024
01:34:36,871 --> 01:34:38,805
- It wasn't that easy.
- No.

1025
01:34:41,842 --> 01:34:45,801
Stoffer is right.
It wasn't good enough.

1026
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:49,882
I had no pride in my inner idiot.
I wasn't good enough.

1027
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:53,111
You did try.

1028
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:55,380
I'm not coming back with you.

1029
01:35:06,767 --> 01:35:08,860
OK.

1030
01:35:30,257 --> 01:35:32,054
Ready yet?

1031
01:35:41,035 --> 01:35:43,697
Karen, my love.

1032
01:35:43,904 --> 01:35:45,667
Take care, now.

1033
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,535
Take care.

1034
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:52,570
Nana...

1035
01:35:55,015 --> 01:35:59,748
Let them go, Karen.
It was all lie.

1036
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,150
I have something I want to say.

1037
01:36:07,895 --> 01:36:09,795
I just want to say...

1038
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:14,897
how happy I have been here.

1039
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:23,267
Being an idiot with you is one
of the best things I've ever done.

1040
01:36:27,348 --> 01:36:30,579
Jeppe...

1041
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:34,949
who is almost like
a little child I might have had.

1042
01:36:37,391 --> 01:36:40,724
And Nana...

1043
01:36:40,895 --> 01:36:42,829
who is so sweet and funny.

1044
01:36:43,364 --> 01:36:46,492
And Miguel...

1045
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:50,092
who has such lovely eyes.

1046
01:36:50,337 --> 01:36:55,297
And Ped, who is such a clever man.

1047
01:36:57,845 --> 01:37:00,211
And strong, strong Katrine.

1048
01:37:08,255 --> 01:37:11,622
And Susanne,...

1049
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:19,392
who smiles at everyone so that
the very heavens shine down upon us.

1050
01:37:22,603 --> 01:37:25,436
I believe...

1051
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:28,502
I love you all...

1052
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:32,544
more than I have
ever loved anybody.

1053
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:40,985
Maybe with one exception.
But that was so long ago now.

1054
01:37:48,329 --> 01:37:52,993
- What day is it tomorrow?
- It's Saturday.

1055
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:58,201
Then it can be done.

1056
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:14,186
It is my turn to go home
and see if I can be an idiot there.

1057
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:19,891
I suppose I'll need
to take one of you along.

1058
01:38:21,795 --> 01:38:24,320
But there isn't room for everyone.

1059
01:38:31,238 --> 01:38:33,468
It may not be very pleasant.

1060
01:38:40,047 --> 01:38:42,481
I think I'd like to take Susanne.

1061
01:38:47,154 --> 01:38:50,988
Will you come?

1062
01:38:51,292 --> 01:38:52,987
I'd like that.

1063
01:38:57,331 --> 01:38:59,094
Good.

1064
01:39:03,337 --> 01:39:09,105
We'll see if I can show you
that it has all been worthwhile.

1065
01:39:35,002 --> 01:39:38,199
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Karen.

1066
01:39:45,312 --> 01:39:47,007
Come in.

1067
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:55,251
Shall I take your jacket?

1068
01:40:03,998 --> 01:40:05,989
Karen...

1069
01:40:07,634 --> 01:40:09,727
Where have you been?

1070
01:40:10,237 --> 01:40:12,068
We thought you were dead.

1071
01:40:14,074 --> 01:40:15,939
This is Susanne.

1072
01:40:17,111 --> 01:40:18,976
And my sister, Britta.

1073
01:40:25,519 --> 01:40:27,419
Louise?

1074
01:40:31,892 --> 01:40:34,827
Karen came back.

1075
01:40:37,331 --> 01:40:40,300
What do you want?

1076
01:40:40,467 --> 01:40:45,837
I just wanted to see how
you all here... This is Susanne.

1077
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:48,808
Anders is coming.

1078
01:40:48,976 --> 01:40:51,035
Yes, I suppose he is.

1079
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:56,843
Karen, is that you?

1080
01:40:57,017 --> 01:40:58,644
Yes, Grandpa.

1081
01:41:12,866 --> 01:41:15,733
We haven't seen her for two weeks.

1082
01:41:22,042 --> 01:41:25,876
Not since the day before the funeral.

1083
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:39,782
Anders and Karen
lost their little boy.

1084
01:41:43,497 --> 01:41:45,829
It probably hurt Anders most.

1085
01:41:48,302 --> 01:41:52,830
What with her just disappearing
and not attending the funeral.

1086
01:42:31,578 --> 01:42:33,443
My pet...

1087
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:53,800
That'll be Anders.

1088
01:43:00,874 --> 01:43:03,866
- Hello, Grandpa
- Hello, Anders.

1089
01:43:08,081 --> 01:43:09,810
Hello, Anders.

1090
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:13,376
Hello, Karen.

1091
01:43:28,602 --> 01:43:31,036
I'm sorry I couldn't come to...

1092
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:37,701
To Martin's... funeral.

1093
01:43:38,278 --> 01:43:42,180
It just means you aren't too upset.

1094
01:43:42,282 --> 01:43:44,341
That's fine.

1095
01:43:57,497 --> 01:43:59,488
