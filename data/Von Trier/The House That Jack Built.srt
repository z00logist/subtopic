1
00:00:41,097 --> 00:00:43,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May I ask you something?</font>

2
00:00:43,478 --> 00:00:46,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't promise I'll answer.</font>

3
00:00:47,655 --> 00:00:51,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">R... right, that's exactly
what I meant.</font>

4
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:55,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, are you allowed to speak
along the way?</font>

5
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was thinking
there might be rules.</font>

6
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me put it this way</font>

7
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:04,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">very few make it all the way
without uttering a word.</font>

8
00:01:04,223 --> 00:01:07,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People are overcome with
a strange and sudden need</font>

9
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to confess on these trips.</font>

10
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And not all of it
can be said to be</font>

11
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:15,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of great rhetorical quality</font>

12
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:18,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but do carry on merrily</font>

13
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just don't believe you're
going to tell me something</font>

14
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't heard before.</font>

15
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:36,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will tentatively
divide my tale</font>

16
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">into 5 randomly
chosen incidents</font>

17
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:41,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over a 12-year period.</font>

18
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:12,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I'm standing here
holding this jack</font>

19
00:02:12,084 --> 00:02:14,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">crap's not working.</font>

20
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:17,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you, uh, do you have a jack
I could borrow?</font>

21
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:19,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm sorry.</font>

22
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No?
- No</font>

23
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No?
- No</font>

24
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:28,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's odd,
I thought everyone had a jack.</font>

25
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:30,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't.</font>

26
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps you could
have a look at my car?</font>

27
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I don't have to
have a look at your car.</font>

28
00:02:37,903 --> 00:02:40,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The issue with your jack
is it's broken.</font>

29
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:42,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There.</font>

30
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:49,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, uh, what's a person
like me supposed to do?</font>

31
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I suppose</font>

32
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:57,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could, uh, drive over
to Sonny's repair shop</font>

33
00:02:57,405 --> 00:02:59,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and call for roadside
assistance.</font>

34
00:02:59,856 --> 00:03:03,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's about, uh,
5 miles from here.</font>

35
00:03:03,204 --> 00:03:04,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of repair shop is it?</font>

36
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:07,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's... it's..
Sonny's a blacksmith, very good one.</font>

37
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:09,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blacksmith.</font>

38
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:13,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe this Sonny can
repair the jack?</font>

39
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd have to talk to Sonny
about that.</font>

40
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:19,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps, I could entice you
to drive me there?</font>

41
00:03:19,772 --> 00:03:21,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Please.
- Um..</font>

42
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:46,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oops, that was a mistake.</font>

43
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mistake?</font>

44
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me getting in this car
with you.</font>

45
00:03:52,322 --> 00:03:53,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was it one's mother
used to say</font>

46
00:03:53,496 --> 00:03:56,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about not getting into cars
with strangers?</font>

47
00:03:56,809 --> 00:03:58,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well..</font>

48
00:03:59,018 --> 00:04:01,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't know what
your mother said.</font>

49
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might as well be
a serial killer.</font>

50
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:07,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry but you do kind of
look like one.</font>

51
00:04:09,028 --> 00:04:10,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd like me
to drive you back to your car?</font>

52
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:14,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.
I can take care of myself.</font>

53
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry,
were you offended</font>

54
00:04:18,797 --> 00:04:20,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I called you
a serial killer?</font>

55
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:22,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

56
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:27,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's of absolutely
no importance to me.</font>

57
00:04:30,464 --> 00:04:32,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe it's just the van.</font>

58
00:04:32,776 --> 00:04:36,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the kind one might expect
to be kidnapped in</font>

59
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:38,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or used to transport corpses.</font>

60
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if you really were
a serial killer</font>

61
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:43,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess the easiest thing
would be just</font>

62
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:48,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to bury my body back up there
by those trees</font>

63
00:04:48,965 --> 00:04:51,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you'd have to remember
to dig 6 feet down</font>

64
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so the foxes couldn't
dig up my grave.</font>

65
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:58,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would I do?</font>

66
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would I do to keep you
from getting away with it?</font>

67
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:06,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, I'd just</font>

68
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:09,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">pick up that jack and hit you
over the head with it.</font>

69
00:05:09,365 --> 00:05:11,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A jack like that can do quite
a bit of damage</font>

70
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">don't you think?</font>

71
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:16,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a medical examiner.</font>

72
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:18,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'd do quite a lot of damage.</font>

73
00:05:39,602 --> 00:05:43,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't forget this.
Good luck with Sonny.</font>

74
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:47,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, would it be too much to ask
for you to drive me back?</font>

75
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:49,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If this Sonny is as fast as
you say he is?</font>

76
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure Sonny is perfectly
capable of giving you</font>

77
00:05:54,202 --> 00:05:55,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a lift back to your..</font>

78
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:57,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As... as I told you before,
I don't like</font>

79
00:05:57,827 --> 00:05:59,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">driving with strangers.</font>

80
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:03,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm just as much of
a stranger as Sonny is.</font>

81
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, getting along just fine.</font>

82
00:06:04,903 --> 00:06:06,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll just go speak to Sonny,
just take a moment.</font>

83
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:20,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonny.</font>

84
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:23,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Jack.</font>

85
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:25,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's it going?</font>

86
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:26,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I was working
on Miller's tractor</font>

87
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:30,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but this lady is being
really persistent.</font>

88
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't say.</font>

89
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:44,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Big mistake.</font>

90
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:47,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The reason serial killers can
roam around free in our country</font>

91
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is that they have no connection
between themselves</font>

92
00:06:50,707 --> 00:06:52,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and their victims.</font>

93
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:54,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you just made
a big mistake</font>

94
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">letting Sonny see
the two of us together.</font>

95
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:11,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know..</font>

96
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:14,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...honestly,
I have more important things</font>

97
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:16,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be doing with my life</font>

98
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than messing around
with this crap.</font>

99
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:21,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You... you said
he was really good.</font>

100
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:23,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well,
I'm sure Sonny was just</font>

101
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:26,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">distracted by your
goddamned blabbering.</font>

102
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:29,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I have to go,
I have an appointment.</font>

103
00:07:29,263 --> 00:07:30,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Appointment,
what appointment?</font>

104
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:36,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's none of your goddamn
business now, is it?</font>

105
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:40,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not just gonna
leave me here.</font>

106
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:42,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact, yes, that is kind of
what I was thinking.</font>

107
00:07:45,106 --> 00:07:48,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure there will be another
serial killer passing by</font>

108
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who can give you a lift
back to Sonny's.</font>

109
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:56,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is, unless he decides
to kill you first.</font>

110
00:07:59,051 --> 00:08:01,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even if I was to beg you
to drive me back?</font>

111
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a last time?</font>

112
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:06,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty please.</font>

113
00:08:20,728 --> 00:08:22,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
I take it all back</font>

114
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what I said earlier about you
looking like a serial killer.</font>

115
00:08:26,078 --> 00:08:28,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no,
you don't have the disposition</font>

116
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:30,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for that sort of thing.</font>

117
00:08:31,532 --> 00:08:34,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're way too much
of a wimp to murder anyone.</font>

118
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:54,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, dear,
you are a dangerous man</font>

119
00:08:54,486 --> 00:08:57,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">smacked her with a jack,
did you?</font>

120
00:08:57,834 --> 00:09:00,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honestly, I've heard of
more murders</font>

121
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:02,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than I can count.</font>

122
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And by the way,
what does this ridiculous man</font>

123
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have to do with anything?</font>

124
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:09,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Glenn Gould</font>

125
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:12,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one of the greatest piano
players of our time.</font>

126
00:09:14,023 --> 00:09:15,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He represents art.</font>

127
00:09:20,616 --> 00:09:23,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So a jack in the face of</font>

128
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:28,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an admittedly unbearable lady
was great art.</font>

129
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that what I'm to make of it?</font>

130
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:34,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dear Mr. Verge,
please give me a chance</font>

131
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:38,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to cast some supplemental
light on the story of the jack.</font>

132
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:42,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The old cathedrals often have
sublime artworks hidden away</font>

133
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the darkest corners
for only God to see</font>

134
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:48,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or whatever
one feels like calling</font>

135
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:50,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the great architect
behind it all.</font>

136
00:09:52,302 --> 00:09:54,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The same goes for murder.</font>

137
00:09:58,343 --> 00:10:00,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I say cathedrals</font>

138
00:10:00,656 --> 00:10:05,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it is first and foremost the
gothic buildings we admire.</font>

139
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:08,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here elegant, pointed arches
have replaced the earlier</font>

140
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">more primitive rounded arches.</font>

141
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:15,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The art of engineering is first
and foremost about statics</font>

142
00:10:15,671 --> 00:10:18,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that is so things remain
standing in spite of</font>

143
00:10:18,466 --> 00:10:21,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the various forces that impact
the buildings.</font>

144
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:26,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In this way, the pointed arch
created a possibility to build</font>

145
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:29,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">much higher
and with much more light</font>

146
00:10:29,857 --> 00:10:33,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but most importantly
with less use of material.</font>

147
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I often say that
the material does the work.</font>

148
00:10:37,382 --> 00:10:40,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In other words it has
a kind of will of its own</font>

149
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:44,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and by following it,
the result will be</font>

150
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:45,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the most exquisite.</font>

151
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So the material was the jack</font>

152
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:53,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it jumped into the lady's
face on its own.</font>

153
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:56,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Art is many things.</font>

154
00:10:58,196 --> 00:11:00,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very convenient and unusual</font>

155
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:03,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the pile of bad excuses.</font>

156
00:11:03,477 --> 00:11:06,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But all of that
is of no interest whatsoever</font>

157
00:11:06,238 --> 00:11:08,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">unless you're an engineer.</font>

158
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:11,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am an engineer.</font>

159
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:22,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mother was of the opinion
that becoming an engineer</font>

160
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:26,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was the more financially
viable choice</font>

161
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:29,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but my really big dream
was to become an architect.</font>

162
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:37,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right before the lady
and the jack</font>

163
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I purchased a building lot</font>

164
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:42,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and since
I was my own developer</font>

165
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">due to a substantial
inheritance</font>

166
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no one could keep me
from drawing up</font>

167
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:50,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my own plans
for my own house.</font>

168
00:11:56,737 --> 00:12:00,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Engineer or architect</font>

169
00:12:00,258 --> 00:12:04,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what I see is an OCD patient
in full bloom.</font>

170
00:12:04,193 --> 00:12:07,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ordnungszwang Jack</font>

171
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:10,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to use a good German word.</font>

172
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, perhaps, it is
in any case true</font>

173
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:16,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I suffered from
compulsions as a child.</font>

174
00:12:16,412 --> 00:12:19,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was completely hysterical
about cleaning</font>

175
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:21,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and could never leave
a room that wasn't</font>

176
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:23,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">perfectly neat and clean.</font>

177
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:26,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A standard that was
difficult to maintain</font>

178
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:28,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the walk-in freezer.</font>

179
00:12:28,907 --> 00:12:31,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The walk-in freezer?</font>

180
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:34,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The walk-in freezer
on Prospect Avenue.</font>

181
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:37,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sign has been broken
for forever</font>

182
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:40,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so no one really knew what
the name of the street was.</font>

183
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:11,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bought the pizzas
from the former owner</font>

184
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the walk-in freezer.</font>

185
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He claimed it was a great deal</font>

186
00:13:16,023 --> 00:13:18,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but of course I never managed
to sell them</font>

187
00:13:18,474 --> 00:13:21,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so it all became
too much for me.</font>

188
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I only ate one of those
shitty pizzas.</font>

189
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:28,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pizza, pizza!</font>

190
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then there was a door
to another room</font>

191
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which I never managed to open.</font>

192
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:57,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A fucking neurotic riddled
with obsessive compulsions</font>

193
00:13:57,789 --> 00:14:00,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a pathetic dream
of something greater.</font>

194
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what about the police?</font>

195
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:23,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I imagine they started
coming around a lot.</font>

196
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, call it luck
if you will.</font>

197
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:34,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had attempted
to hide her car..</font>

198
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but to my great annoyance</font>

199
00:14:39,624 --> 00:14:43,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you could still catch a glimpse
of it from the main road.</font>

200
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:48,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, without realizing
where I had parked the car</font>

201
00:14:48,978 --> 00:14:50,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was a stroke of genius.</font>

202
00:14:50,704 --> 00:14:54,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, the small brook
defines the state border</font>

203
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:55,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the local police,
per definition</font>

204
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:58,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can't see across state lines.</font>

205
00:14:58,091 --> 00:14:59,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not their jurisdiction.</font>

206
00:14:59,747 --> 00:15:02,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I had no inquiries
from the police.</font>

207
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And by the way,
I don't even know if Sonny</font>

208
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">had told them about me.</font>

209
00:15:06,754 --> 00:15:08,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We met up quite
a few times since</font>

210
00:15:08,998 --> 00:15:11,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but never spoke of it.</font>

211
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:44,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on.</font>

212
00:16:48,304 --> 00:16:49,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

213
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:50,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

214
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:54,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

215
00:16:54,552 --> 00:16:55,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Police.</font>

216
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did something happen?</font>

217
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no, no</font>

218
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:03,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">luckily nothing exactly
has happened as of yet.</font>

219
00:17:03,664 --> 00:17:05,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand that
you are fond of</font>

220
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:09,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">shopping at
Carlson's Supermarket.</font>

221
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why? Did something happen
at Carlson's?</font>

222
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:16,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, uh, however
we'd like to, uh, prevent</font>

223
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:20,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">things from happening
to businesses in the vicinity</font>

224
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:25,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like Carlson's Supermarket.</font>

225
00:17:26,894 --> 00:17:30,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, may... may,
may I come in?</font>

226
00:17:30,036 --> 00:17:32,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to see
a police badge.</font>

227
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:35,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So would I.</font>

228
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:40,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unfortunately, that today</font>

229
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:42,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is going to be a bit of
a problem.</font>

230
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:44,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, ahem..</font>

231
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:47,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...I can tell by your expression</font>

232
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you think it's a bad thing</font>

233
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I don't have my police
badge on me.</font>

234
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

235
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:54,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm here to tell you that</font>

236
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's a, it's a good thing..</font>

237
00:17:58,236 --> 00:17:59,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...for the police department</font>

238
00:17:59,686 --> 00:18:01,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm not going to
lie to you, okay?</font>

239
00:18:01,688 --> 00:18:03,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It also happens to be
a good thing for me</font>

240
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on a personal level. Yeah.</font>

241
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:10,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see my... my badge</font>

242
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:13,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's, uh, at the silversmith.</font>

243
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's at the,
the silversmith.</font>

244
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're... they're shining it up
and, ah..</font>

245
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...adding a few additional
citations to it.</font>

246
00:18:25,436 --> 00:18:26,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been promoted.</font>

247
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Right.</font>

248
00:18:33,064 --> 00:18:35,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So now you're..</font>

249
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:36,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now... now what are you?</font>

250
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:39,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, what's your,
what's your rank now?</font>

251
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:43,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not at liberty
to discuss that.</font>

252
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:46,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, that's considered
classified information.</font>

253
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, I think this is safe
to say that</font>

254
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's a considerable..</font>

255
00:18:54,154 --> 00:18:55,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...leap up the ladder.</font>

256
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh, ahem, now may I...
- No.</font>

257
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:02,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not without a badge.</font>

258
00:19:03,646 --> 00:19:06,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bravo, bravo, bravo,
that's excellent.</font>

259
00:19:06,787 --> 00:19:10,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's exactly just the type of
response we like to see.</font>

260
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:14,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You say no, that makes my day.
- Right.</font>

261
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:17,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, everybody's always
talking about security</font>

262
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:19,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but what... what is actually
anybody doing about it?</font>

263
00:19:19,835 --> 00:19:22,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, is quite
the correct answer.</font>

264
00:19:22,424 --> 00:19:24,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's quite
the correct answer indeed.</font>

265
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:28,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course you'll never allow
somebody in your home</font>

266
00:19:28,464 --> 00:19:31,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just because they say,
"Oh, I'm a police officer."</font>

267
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no, no.
You don't do that.</font>

268
00:19:32,882 --> 00:19:34,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

269
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:36,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wait until they show you
the proper..</font>

270
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:40,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Badge.
- Yeah. The badge.</font>

271
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:42,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yup.
- That's correct. Yeah.</font>

272
00:19:42,685 --> 00:19:43,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um..</font>

273
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:49,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May I, uh, ask you a..</font>

274
00:19:50,348 --> 00:19:53,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...ah, somewhat
personal question?</font>

275
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:57,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, when exactly</font>

276
00:19:57,286 --> 00:20:00,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was it that you lost your,
your husband?</font>

277
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:05,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was just over
6 months ago</font>

278
00:20:05,743 --> 00:20:08,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that my husband passed..</font>

279
00:20:08,194 --> 00:20:09,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you going with this?</font>

280
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm just thinking
about your..</font>

281
00:20:12,784 --> 00:20:15,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your pension, yeah.</font>

282
00:20:15,787 --> 00:20:18,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet with a simple phone call
to one of my colleagues</font>

283
00:20:18,721 --> 00:20:21,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">down in headquarters,
I could get you a, ah..</font>

284
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:24,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...considerable increase
in your pension.</font>

285
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:25,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet that I could,
I could double</font>

286
00:20:26,004 --> 00:20:27,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what you're currently receiving.</font>

287
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:31,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute.</font>

288
00:20:33,322 --> 00:20:36,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could get me
double my pension</font>

289
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:38,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from the police department
by calling people?</font>

290
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:40,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, forgive me, uh, uh..</font>

291
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:44,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...I, I've tricked you, a bit.</font>

292
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact, as it, as it stands</font>

293
00:20:47,302 --> 00:20:50,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not,
I'm not a police officer.</font>

294
00:20:50,995 --> 00:20:52,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

295
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm an insurance agent, lady.</font>

296
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The, the whole story
that I told you about the badge</font>

297
00:20:58,347 --> 00:21:02,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's, t-that's something
that we've been asked to do</font>

298
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:06,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by the authorities,
it's, it's for statistical</font>

299
00:21:06,493 --> 00:21:08,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">purposes or something.</font>

300
00:21:09,496 --> 00:21:12,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi, Glenn.
- Hi, Claire.</font>

301
00:21:12,085 --> 00:21:14,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's my friend Glenn.
- Glenn. Yeah, great guy.</font>

302
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know Glenn?
- Yeah, sure.</font>

303
00:21:16,503 --> 00:21:18,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, listen, are you interested</font>

304
00:21:18,747 --> 00:21:21,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in this, this increase,
uh, the money?</font>

305
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:24,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if you can double it.</font>

306
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:27,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It won't take more than
a few minutes of your time.</font>

307
00:21:27,238 --> 00:21:29,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alright, listen,
you can come in.</font>

308
00:21:30,034 --> 00:21:32,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This damn door sticks.</font>

309
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:34,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, what the heck's
the worst that could happen</font>

310
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:36,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as long as you can
double my pension.</font>

311
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it.</font>

312
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:42,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something wrong?</font>

313
00:21:45,498 --> 00:21:47,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is so damn humiliating.</font>

314
00:21:50,157 --> 00:21:53,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know being forced
to, to stand out there</font>

315
00:21:54,023 --> 00:21:57,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">exposed, time and time again</font>

316
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:01,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have to be
put in these situations</font>

317
00:22:02,031 --> 00:22:03,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know why.</font>

318
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I'm sorry,
uh, I-I.. I was jus..</font>

319
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:07,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know
how humiliating it is?</font>

320
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:12,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am constantly being
put in these situations.</font>

321
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:13,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just not fair.</font>

322
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:14,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Do you think it's fair?</font>

323
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:17,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- No.</font>

324
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want me
to get you a cup of tea?</font>

325
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:21,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah, nah, nah.
Don't worry about it.</font>

326
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow! Fuck.</font>

327
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:33,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow! Fuck. Ah, fuck. Fuck.</font>

328
00:22:35,962 --> 00:22:37,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hell do you think
you're going?</font>

329
00:23:22,146 --> 00:23:25,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no. Oh, no.</font>

330
00:23:30,085 --> 00:23:31,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

331
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:33,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put this under your head.</font>

332
00:23:37,506 --> 00:23:39,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. Ow.</font>

333
00:23:47,413 --> 00:23:50,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry.</font>

334
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh..</font>

335
00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:56,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What can I do
to make this good again?</font>

336
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What can I do?
- Ugh!</font>

337
00:24:03,256 --> 00:24:05,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can I help you?</font>

338
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:06,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What can I do
to make it better?</font>

339
00:24:08,123 --> 00:24:10,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Speak to me?
- Talk..</font>

340
00:24:10,677 --> 00:24:12,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can't talk? Okay.
- Can't.</font>

341
00:24:27,936 --> 00:24:29,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on a second.</font>

342
00:24:29,662 --> 00:24:33,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have something else I think
you're gonna like quite a bit.</font>

343
00:24:33,286 --> 00:24:35,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you like donuts?</font>

344
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh.</font>

345
00:24:46,126 --> 00:24:48,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have here..</font>

346
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:51,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>

347
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:57,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, chamomile.</font>

348
00:24:58,138 --> 00:24:59,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good for you.</font>

349
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:22,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Chri..</font>

350
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:21,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A murderer with OCD.</font>

351
00:29:21,816 --> 00:29:24,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's almost ridiculous</font>

352
00:29:24,646 --> 00:29:26,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but how unfortunate
for you, Jack.</font>

353
00:29:26,855 --> 00:29:30,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And to top it off,
with cleaning compulsions.</font>

354
00:31:35,432 --> 00:31:36,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

355
00:33:53,604 --> 00:33:55,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please get out of the car, sir.</font>

356
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:11,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you mind if I take a look
in the van please, sir?</font>

357
00:34:15,212 --> 00:34:18,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'd be a bad guy if I said no.
- Alright, open her up, please.</font>

358
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

359
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:29,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, sir, but there's
been a minor break-in</font>

360
00:34:29,123 --> 00:34:31,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">down the street just now.</font>

361
00:34:31,573 --> 00:34:32,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to ask you
a couple of questions</font>

362
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:35,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about anything you may
have seen or heard, yeah?</font>

363
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:39,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Glenn said you were
visiting Claire.</font>

364
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:41,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry y... you said something ab...
about a break-in?</font>

365
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh-huh.
- Well..</font>

366
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:48,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, unfortunately
I think you've got</font>

367
00:34:48,763 --> 00:34:50,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a more serious problem.</font>

368
00:34:51,628 --> 00:34:54,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Claire, she's disappeared.</font>

369
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clair Miller has disappeared?</font>

370
00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:02,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I've been,
uh, sitting out here</font>

371
00:35:02,397 --> 00:35:05,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the last two hours
in my van waiting for her.</font>

372
00:35:05,676 --> 00:35:07,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

373
00:35:07,126 --> 00:35:09,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, ahem,
I contacted Claire</font>

374
00:35:09,611 --> 00:35:13,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because, uh, her late husband
was a dear friend of mine.</font>

375
00:35:13,615 --> 00:35:15,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We worked together
for number of years</font>

376
00:35:15,203 --> 00:35:18,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the railroad
and, uh, I'm a collector.</font>

377
00:35:18,655 --> 00:35:20,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I collect.</font>

378
00:35:20,174 --> 00:35:23,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, I collect Trax.</font>

379
00:35:23,384 --> 00:35:24,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Trax?
- Old issues of Trax.</font>

380
00:35:24,557 --> 00:35:28,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a, uh, publication
owned by the railroad</font>

381
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and, uh, Jerry, uh</font>

382
00:35:31,737 --> 00:35:33,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, I happen
to know for a fact</font>

383
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:36,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that he also subscribed
and was an enthusiast</font>

384
00:35:36,742 --> 00:35:38,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">such as myself.</font>

385
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So Claire said
she'd run inside</font>

386
00:35:41,885 --> 00:35:43,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and see if she could rustle up</font>

387
00:35:43,404 --> 00:35:46,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a couple of back issues for me.</font>

388
00:35:46,338 --> 00:35:47,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She didn't ask me in.</font>

389
00:35:47,994 --> 00:35:48,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

390
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better safe than sorry</font>

391
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:53,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when an oddball like myself
just turns up, right?</font>

392
00:35:53,793 --> 00:35:56,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.</font>

393
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I knocked several times
and, uh, she hasn't answered.</font>

394
00:36:01,663 --> 00:36:03,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

395
00:36:03,976 --> 00:36:07,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I'm gonna ask you
to stay right here.</font>

396
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just gonna go take a look.</font>

397
00:36:24,445 --> 00:36:26,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Claire, it's Ed.</font>

398
00:36:29,691 --> 00:36:32,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Maybe the door is open.
- What?</font>

399
00:36:33,074 --> 00:36:35,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or maybe not.</font>

400
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Claire, you here?</font>

401
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:07,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Claire?</font>

402
00:37:14,184 --> 00:37:15,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is she up there?
- No, she's not up there.</font>

403
00:37:15,703 --> 00:37:17,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe she went out
through the back.</font>

404
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:20,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, I think
I would have noticed that.</font>

405
00:37:20,915 --> 00:37:25,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, this is really,
really strange.</font>

406
00:37:25,437 --> 00:37:26,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you ask me, I'd say</font>

407
00:37:26,886 --> 00:37:29,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that this needs to be
thoroughly investigated.</font>

408
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, well
I'm not askin' you.</font>

409
00:37:31,063 --> 00:37:33,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I have to say,
also, that I heard</font>

410
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:38,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">uh, some noises coming
from... the living room.</font>

411
00:37:38,346 --> 00:37:40,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Noises?
- Yeah, some noises.</font>

412
00:37:40,314 --> 00:37:42,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, I, of course, I can't be sure</font>

413
00:37:43,006 --> 00:37:44,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it sounded
a little bit like a..</font>

414
00:37:45,008 --> 00:37:46,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a scuffle of some kind.</font>

415
00:37:46,837 --> 00:37:48,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scuffle?</font>

416
00:37:48,805 --> 00:37:51,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. You're gonna have
to put that back down, now.</font>

417
00:37:51,463 --> 00:37:54,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, that kind of investigation,
that's for police, don't.</font>

418
00:37:54,293 --> 00:37:55,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, right.</font>

419
00:37:55,605 --> 00:37:58,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the house.</font>

420
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:01,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry?
- Sir, now!</font>

421
00:38:01,438 --> 00:38:03,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Mm-hm.</font>

422
00:38:03,337 --> 00:38:05,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I'm gonna
do so under protest.</font>

423
00:38:05,546 --> 00:38:09,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, I feel like
that my observations</font>

424
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:12,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">well, they could be of use
in an investigation.</font>

425
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:15,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a tax-paying citizen,
someone who is fully aware</font>

426
00:38:15,763 --> 00:38:17,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of my constitutional rights.</font>

427
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:18,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

428
00:38:18,766 --> 00:38:21,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">O... officer, please
allow me to finish</font>

429
00:38:21,355 --> 00:38:24,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just trying to be
of assistance, okay?</font>

430
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got one minute, sir.</font>

431
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would like
to recommend one thing</font>

432
00:38:26,877 --> 00:38:28,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's within my right,</font>

433
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:32,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that this room
is inspected impeccably.</font>

434
00:38:34,402 --> 00:38:38,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With a magnifying glass
if you catch my drift.</font>

435
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:41,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get out.
- Have a nice day, officer.</font>

436
00:38:41,927 --> 00:38:43,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out, sir.</font>



441
00:39:55,966 --> 00:39:58,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't the police officers
in your story</font>

442
00:39:58,141 --> 00:40:00,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">seem exceptionally naive?</font>

443
00:40:00,695 --> 00:40:02,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that the point?</font>

444
00:40:02,973 --> 00:40:07,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, but here it comes,
the point that is.</font>

445
00:40:07,702 --> 00:40:09,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can hardly wait.</font>

446
00:40:19,852 --> 00:40:21,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The great rain!</font>

447
00:40:23,477 --> 00:40:27,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It washed away the long track
from my escape.</font>

448
00:40:29,724 --> 00:40:31,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I don't consider myself</font>

449
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:34,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a decidedly
devoted man of faith.</font>

450
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which, of course, is a
totally crazy thing to say</font>

451
00:40:38,008 --> 00:40:41,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">considering
our present situation</font>

452
00:40:41,115 --> 00:40:43,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I must admit..</font>

453
00:40:43,531 --> 00:40:47,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...I experienced the rain,
the fiercest I have ever seen</font>

454
00:40:47,293 --> 00:40:50,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a kind of a blessing.</font>

455
00:40:50,676 --> 00:40:54,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the murder
as a kind of liberation.</font>

456
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I felt I had
a higher protector.</font>

457
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And in the reality you were</font>

458
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just a terrifying
perverted Satan.</font>

459
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:19,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, did you understand,
or even better, did you accept</font>

460
00:41:20,016 --> 00:41:23,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the connection
to your own personality?</font>

461
00:41:23,537 --> 00:41:27,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That you yourself
were a psychopath?</font>

462
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:36,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm not stupid.</font>

463
00:41:39,484 --> 00:41:41,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's rather unusual.</font>

464
00:41:41,278 --> 00:41:43,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The psychopath
will never accept</font>

465
00:41:43,488 --> 00:41:45,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">his own diagnosis.</font>

466
00:41:48,285 --> 00:41:50,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I did!</font>

467
00:41:50,184 --> 00:41:52,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For instance,
the psychopath's</font>

468
00:41:52,462 --> 00:41:54,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lack of empathy.</font>

469
00:41:54,947 --> 00:41:58,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I went to great lengths
to fake normal empathy..</font>

470
00:41:58,951 --> 00:42:02,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...in order to hide
amongst the masses.</font>

471
00:42:02,161 --> 00:42:04,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smile.</font>

472
00:42:06,856 --> 00:42:09,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.</font>

473
00:42:16,072 --> 00:42:17,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Disappointed.</font>

474
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:22,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very, very disappointed.</font>


478
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:50,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the reeds?</font>

479
00:42:51,763 --> 00:42:54,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was a very sensitive child..</font>

480
00:42:54,766 --> 00:42:57,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...profoundly
afraid of playing.</font>

481
00:42:57,631 --> 00:42:59,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For example, hide and seek.</font>

482
00:42:59,978 --> 00:43:01,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the case of hide</font>

483
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always chose to run
in near panic</font>

484
00:43:04,638 --> 00:43:07,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">into a field
of reeds to hide.</font>

485
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:11,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see something
other than a scared kid.</font>

486
00:43:11,852 --> 00:43:15,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see a kid with a more
mysterious goal.</font>

487
00:43:15,614 --> 00:43:19,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The choice of the dash through
the reeds was an escape</font>

488
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:22,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but also an open
invitation to the pursuer</font>

489
00:43:22,794 --> 00:43:27,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because of the clear path
of broken reeds left behind.</font>

490
00:43:27,971 --> 00:43:31,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was there an element
of come and catch me</font>

491
00:43:31,147 --> 00:43:33,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in you as a child?</font>

492
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or perhaps, more importantly</font>

493
00:43:36,221 --> 00:43:38,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in you as a person?</font>

494
00:43:40,674 --> 00:43:43,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was there never a tiny grain
of disappointment</font>

495
00:43:43,953 --> 00:43:47,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about the great rain
that washed away</font>

496
00:43:47,128 --> 00:43:50,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your tracks so you
couldn't be caught?</font>

497
00:43:50,062 --> 00:43:52,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More like amazement..</font>

498
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:55,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...when I think about all the
things I've done in my life</font>

499
00:43:55,654 --> 00:43:59,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without it, in any way,
resulting in punishment.</font>

500
00:44:17,814 --> 00:44:20,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I loved when the men
from the village</font>

501
00:44:20,127 --> 00:44:22,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">cut the meadows
with their scythes.</font>

502
00:44:29,446 --> 00:44:32,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back then one spoke
of the breath of the meadow.</font>

503
00:44:33,865 --> 00:44:35,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone working in rhythm</font>

504
00:44:35,763 --> 00:44:38,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">exhaling when they mowed,
and inhaling when they pulled</font>

505
00:44:38,904 --> 00:44:40,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the scythes back.</font>

506
00:45:03,549 --> 00:45:06,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was as if the meadow
lived at its fullest</font>

507
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in my consciousness..</font>

508
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...when I listened
to its breath.</font>

509
00:46:34,468 --> 00:46:37,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop that.</font>

510
00:46:39,749 --> 00:46:41,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it.</font>

511
00:46:43,063 --> 00:46:44,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it!</font>

512
00:46:47,653 --> 00:46:49,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it!</font>

513
00:47:10,918 --> 00:47:14,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Experience had taught me
how to strangle correctly</font>

514
00:47:15,026 --> 00:47:16,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and for long enough.</font>

515
00:47:25,174 --> 00:47:27,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bravo, Jack!</font>

516
00:47:27,072 --> 00:47:31,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You certainly
are clever and tough..</font>

517
00:47:31,214 --> 00:47:33,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...just like
all the other criminals.</font>

518
00:47:54,824 --> 00:47:58,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fact is, when,
after several more murders</font>

519
00:47:58,828 --> 00:48:01,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I felt my OCD diminish</font>

520
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:03,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I started to take
greater chances.</font>

521
00:49:13,627 --> 00:49:16,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This time I was completely
dissatisfied with the pictures</font>

522
00:49:16,906 --> 00:49:19,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I decided to take new ones.</font>

523
00:49:55,565 --> 00:49:58,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck. Fuck! Fuck it!</font>

524
00:50:22,903 --> 00:50:25,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

525
00:50:25,112 --> 00:50:27,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It struck me like lightning
from a clear sky.</font>

526
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:28,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck!</font>

527
00:50:28,357 --> 00:50:29,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't resist running</font>

528
00:50:29,565 --> 00:50:31,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that little old lady over.</font>

529
00:50:32,499 --> 00:50:35,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It made my already rather
daring plan of bringing</font>

530
00:50:35,088 --> 00:50:37,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the first body back
to the scene of the murder</font>

531
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in order to take
some more inspired photos</font>

532
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a great deal more dangerous.</font>

533
00:50:42,923 --> 00:50:45,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I now had a severely
hemorrhaging body</font>

534
00:50:45,581 --> 00:50:50,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and another body in a bizarre,
frozen position on my hands.</font>

535
00:50:50,103 --> 00:50:51,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goddammit!</font>



537
00:51:00,044 --> 00:51:02,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could you elaborate a little</font>

538
00:51:02,253 --> 00:51:05,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on why the old lady had to die?</font>

539
00:51:05,256 --> 00:51:09,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't explain it all,
but perhaps I can describe it</font>

540
00:51:09,432 --> 00:51:11,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as the kind of blood frenzy</font>

541
00:51:11,296 --> 00:51:14,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an ermine experiences
in a hen house.</font>

542
00:51:15,921 --> 00:51:18,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know Blake's poems..</font>

543
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:20,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...about the lamb
and the tiger?</font>

544
00:51:21,755 --> 00:51:25,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do know Blake superficially</font>

545
00:51:25,483 --> 00:51:30,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'm afraid I won't escape
a comprehensive tutorial.</font>

546
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God created both
the lamb and the tiger.</font>

547
00:51:37,391 --> 00:51:39,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The lamb represents innocence</font>

548
00:51:39,428 --> 00:51:41,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the tiger represents
savagery.</font>

549
00:51:41,947 --> 00:51:44,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Both parts are perfect
and necessary.</font>

550
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The tiger lives
on blood and murder</font>

551
00:51:46,987 --> 00:51:48,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">kills the lamb..</font>

552
00:51:48,954 --> 00:51:52,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and that is also
the artist's nature.</font>

553
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:56,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You read Blake like
the devil reads the Bible.</font>

554
00:51:56,652 --> 00:51:59,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After all, the poor lamb
didn't ask to die</font>

555
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in order to become even
the greatest art.</font>

556
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The lamb has been bestowed
with the honor of living</font>

557
00:52:06,765 --> 00:52:10,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">forever in art,
and art is divine.</font>

558
00:52:14,152 --> 00:52:17,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But still the same red van.
Now all bloody.</font>

559
00:52:17,811 --> 00:52:19,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somewhat reckless,
I should think</font>

560
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you don't want
to be found out.</font>

561
00:52:23,886 --> 00:52:27,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, that's exactly
what I thought..</font>

562
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but I didn't have
the strength to change it</font>

563
00:52:29,892 --> 00:52:32,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and besides, everything was
still going remarkably well.</font>

564
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the best way
to hide is to not hide at all.</font>

565
00:52:54,296 --> 00:53:00,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now, as I said,
the OCD was on decline..</font>

566
00:53:00,129 --> 00:53:03,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...so I took deliberate risks
and didn't remove the blood</font>

567
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:06,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from either the bedroom
or the car.</font>

568
00:53:06,411 --> 00:53:09,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was actually quite
liberating to reach that point.</font>

569
00:53:13,763 --> 00:53:18,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It turned out the little old
lady who was merely an accident</font>

570
00:53:18,078 --> 00:53:22,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">added a great touch of humor
to my staged photographs.</font>

571
00:53:22,255 --> 00:53:24,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I was very pleased
with the outcome.</font>

572
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sophistication.</font>

573
00:53:36,648 --> 00:53:39,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Sophistication? Of course!</font>

574
00:53:39,858 --> 00:53:43,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your narcissism
knows no bounds.</font>

575
00:53:50,283 --> 00:53:52,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I sent the picture
to the local paper</font>

576
00:53:52,423 --> 00:53:55,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which usually distinguished
itself by running stories</font>

577
00:53:55,771 --> 00:54:00,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about missing, not to say,
uh, stolen garden gates</font>

578
00:54:00,293 --> 00:54:03,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and so, might do well
with a story with a, you know</font>

579
00:54:03,779 --> 00:54:06,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">little more bite.</font>

580
00:54:06,057 --> 00:54:08,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For me though, what was really
sensational about the work</font>

581
00:54:08,956 --> 00:54:11,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the photo,
it wasn't the image</font>

582
00:54:11,545 --> 00:54:13,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the negative.</font>

583
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:18,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I was 10 years old,
I discovered</font>

584
00:54:18,863 --> 00:54:21,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that through the negative,
you could see</font>

585
00:54:21,279 --> 00:54:25,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the real inner
demonic quality of the light.</font>

586
00:54:25,732 --> 00:54:27,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The dark light.</font>

587
00:55:15,678 --> 00:55:19,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what about
repentance, Jack?</font>

588
00:55:19,544 --> 00:55:23,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ones I deal with tend
to repent all over the place.</font>

589
00:55:25,378 --> 00:55:27,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I repent nothing</font>

590
00:55:27,345 --> 00:55:29,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no matter how long
we have to walk</font>

591
00:55:29,968 --> 00:55:32,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I did think
of something the other day.</font>

592
00:55:32,868 --> 00:55:36,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imagine a man
walking down a street</font>

593
00:55:36,181 --> 00:55:38,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">underneath the street lamps.</font>

594
00:55:38,701 --> 00:55:41,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right under a light
his shadow is the densest</font>

595
00:55:41,325 --> 00:55:43,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but also the tiniest.</font>

596
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:45,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then when he starts to move</font>

597
00:55:45,398 --> 00:55:48,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">his shadow grows
in front of him.</font>

598
00:55:48,228 --> 00:55:50,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The shadow becomes
bigger and bigger</font>

599
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:54,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">while it thins out
and the shadow behind him</font>

600
00:55:54,061 --> 00:55:56,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from the next lamppost emerges</font>

601
00:55:56,616 --> 00:55:59,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and becomes
shorter and shorter</font>

602
00:55:59,515 --> 00:56:01,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until it reaches
its ultimate density</font>

603
00:56:01,966 --> 00:56:05,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as the man stands directly
underneath the light.</font>

604
00:56:05,763 --> 00:56:07,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's say that the man standing</font>

605
00:56:07,454 --> 00:56:09,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">underneath the first lamppost
is me</font>

606
00:56:09,732 --> 00:56:11,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I've just
committed a murder.</font>

607
00:56:11,527 --> 00:56:14,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel strong and content.</font>

608
00:56:14,634 --> 00:56:18,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I start to walk and the shadow
in front of me grows bigger</font>

609
00:56:18,948 --> 00:56:21,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like my pleasure,
but at the same time</font>

610
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:25,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">pain is on its way,
represented by the shadow</font>

611
00:56:25,645 --> 00:56:28,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">behind me
from the next lamppost</font>

612
00:56:28,337 --> 00:56:32,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and at the midpoint
between the lampposts</font>

613
00:56:32,237 --> 00:56:36,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the pain is so great
it outweighs my pleasure.</font>

614
00:56:36,656 --> 00:56:39,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And with every step forward
pleasure dissolves</font>

615
00:56:39,762 --> 00:56:42,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and pain
intensifies behind me.</font>

616
00:56:42,558 --> 00:56:46,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finally the pain
is so unbearably intense</font>

617
00:56:46,666 --> 00:56:49,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I have to act,
so when I reach the point</font>

618
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the next lamp in zenith</font>

619
00:56:52,188 --> 00:56:53,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will kill again.</font>

620
00:56:55,502 --> 00:57:00,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you want
to be someone special, Jack</font>

621
00:57:00,162 --> 00:57:03,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but let's face it,
this illustration can be used</font>

622
00:57:03,407 --> 00:57:06,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for any addict's tale of woe.</font>

623
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The alcoholic empties
the bottle at the zenith</font>

624
00:57:09,102 --> 00:57:10,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">et cetera, et cetera.</font>

625
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:14,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what about the family?</font>

626
00:57:21,735 --> 00:57:24,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand that your
occupation didn't leave</font>

627
00:57:24,635 --> 00:57:27,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">any room for a family
in your life.</font>

628
00:57:27,534 --> 00:57:30,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, why?</font>

629
00:57:30,295 --> 00:57:33,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it could be,
despite everything</font>

630
00:57:33,229 --> 00:57:36,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that speculating about this
might have triggered</font>

631
00:57:36,267 --> 00:57:39,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just a tiny bit
of human feeling.</font>

632
00:57:39,201 --> 00:57:44,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For example, a variation on
what those of us less clever</font>

633
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">might call need.</font>

634
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:49,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Need? Because
I never had a family?</font>

635
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:52,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I can't say that it did.</font>

636
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:55,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the concept of family
actually inspired</font>

637
00:57:55,907 --> 00:57:58,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one of my greatest works.</font>

638
00:58:23,797 --> 00:58:25,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, hats for everyone</font>

639
00:58:25,696 --> 00:58:27,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you are to keep
your hats on at all times.</font>

640
00:58:27,801 --> 00:58:30,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- Safety procedures.</font>

641
00:58:36,569 --> 00:58:38,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we go up there, mom?</font>

642
00:58:38,156 --> 00:58:40,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course we're gonna go up.</font>

643
00:58:40,227 --> 00:58:42,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smile, grumpy, it'll be fun.</font>

644
00:58:42,885 --> 00:58:45,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think so.</font>

645
00:58:45,094 --> 00:58:47,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's for your sake we've come
all the way out here.</font>

646
00:58:47,752 --> 00:58:50,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you I didn't wanna go.</font>

647
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:51,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna see the weapons?</font>

648
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:57,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This, George, is a rifle.</font>

649
00:58:57,037 --> 00:59:00,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This rifle has the capacity
to hit its target</font>

650
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:03,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at a distance
of several 100 yards.</font>

651
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And kill larger animals.</font>

652
00:59:07,496 --> 00:59:09,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you killed
any large animals?</font>

653
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, yes, I have.</font>

654
00:59:12,881 --> 00:59:14,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that's not something
that I'm proud of.</font>

655
00:59:14,848 --> 00:59:17,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I'd killed
some large animals</font>

656
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:18,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd be proud of it.</font>

657
00:59:18,611 --> 00:59:22,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess that's where
you and I differ, Georgie.</font>

658
00:59:22,373 --> 00:59:24,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This here is a shotgun.</font>

659
00:59:25,618 --> 00:59:28,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's what they call
a smoothbore weapon.</font>

660
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:30,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not as precise
as the rifle</font>

661
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:32,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it's more effective</font>

662
00:59:32,832 --> 00:59:34,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when the animal is closer
and moving.</font>

663
00:59:36,594 --> 00:59:38,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can touch it if you want.</font>

664
00:59:38,182 --> 00:59:39,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I?</font>

665
00:59:41,012 --> 00:59:42,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

666
00:59:42,566 --> 00:59:44,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we going hunting?</font>

667
00:59:44,775 --> 00:59:45,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

668
00:59:46,949 --> 00:59:49,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunting is such
an unpleasant thing.</font>

669
00:59:52,368 --> 00:59:55,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to hunt quite a bit,
but I've stopped.</font>

670
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

671
00:59:57,166 --> 01:00:01,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be honest,
I find hunting distasteful.</font>

672
01:00:01,654 --> 01:00:04,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For example, if I wanted
to shoot some of the crows</font>

673
01:00:04,795 --> 01:00:07,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">up in that tree,
we'd be talking about</font>

674
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:11,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what is known as culling,
which quite simply means</font>

675
01:00:11,387 --> 01:00:15,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you want to determine which
animals you are going to allow</font>

676
01:00:15,322 --> 01:00:16,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to live in your forest.</font>

677
01:00:18,153 --> 01:00:20,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The crow has no value as prey</font>

678
01:00:20,431 --> 01:00:23,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but can be culled because
they are seen as something</font>

679
01:00:23,503 --> 01:00:27,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of a threat to animals
you wanna cultivate.</font>

680
01:00:28,819 --> 01:00:33,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Culling, it's also such
an unpleasant word.</font>

681
01:00:33,409 --> 01:00:37,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It has a tinge of ethnic
cleansing about it.</font>

682
01:00:37,517 --> 01:00:41,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The very sick
and twisted act of hunting</font>

683
01:00:41,452 --> 01:00:43,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has been ritualized</font>

684
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:46,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to such an unsettling degree.</font>

685
01:00:46,837 --> 01:00:49,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The battue, for example</font>

686
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:52,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where a row of beaters
scares the living daylight</font>

687
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:53,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">out of an entire forest.</font>

688
01:00:56,294 --> 01:00:59,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not to mention the trophy
parade, practiced primarily</font>

689
01:00:59,194 --> 01:01:01,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in Europe
at the end of the hunt</font>

690
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:03,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a final insult</font>

691
01:01:03,647 --> 01:01:07,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in which each species
has its own traditional place.</font>

692
01:01:07,271 --> 01:01:09,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We want to go up
in the tower, mom.</font>

693
01:01:09,514 --> 01:01:10,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh. George, wait.</font>

694
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:13,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep, we are going up.</font>

695
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, George,
you want to shoot?</font>

696
01:01:31,502 --> 01:01:34,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll aim..</font>

697
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:35,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...you pull the trigger.</font>

698
01:01:38,958 --> 01:01:39,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire!</font>

699
01:01:42,651 --> 01:01:43,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excellent!</font>

700
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:53,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To fell an animal of this size</font>

701
01:01:53,282 --> 01:01:55,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you have to be sure
to hit it in the vitals</font>

702
01:01:55,353 --> 01:01:58,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is to say here,
in the area of the lungs.</font>

703
01:01:59,495 --> 01:02:02,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you can see,
this one was hit here</font>

704
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:04,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the hind quarter.</font>

705
01:02:04,535 --> 01:02:06,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An animal could run
a great distance</font>

706
01:02:06,088 --> 01:02:08,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with an injury such as this.</font>

707
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:10,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why typically
a good hunter would have</font>

708
01:02:10,575 --> 01:02:15,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a Schweiss-dog, that's trained
in following a blood trail</font>

709
01:02:15,339 --> 01:02:18,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you can track the animal
down and finish the job.</font>

710
01:02:20,413 --> 01:02:25,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Schweiss, well, that's
the word we use for blood trail.</font>

711
01:02:25,418 --> 01:02:29,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations, young Georgie,
you hit the animal.</font>

712
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:35,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you had found yourself
a family?</font>

713
01:02:35,428 --> 01:02:40,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, that's also how
I like to see it.</font>

714
01:02:43,505 --> 01:02:47,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's all so much
simpler with animals.</font>

715
01:02:47,405 --> 01:02:49,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

716
01:02:49,614 --> 01:02:52,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The order is important.</font>

717
01:02:52,169 --> 01:02:55,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hind will typically run in
the front with the largest fawn</font>

718
01:02:55,759 --> 01:02:58,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">following the smallest last.</font>

719
01:02:58,106 --> 01:02:59,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd typically shoot
at the deer</font>

720
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:01,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">starting with the rear one</font>

721
01:03:01,178 --> 01:03:04,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">based on the fact that the two
older animals can survive</font>

722
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without the young one</font>

723
01:03:06,148 --> 01:03:08,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whereas, if you shot
the mother first</font>

724
01:03:09,013 --> 01:03:10,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and didn't get the others</font>

725
01:03:10,946 --> 01:03:13,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">both fawns would probably
not survive.</font>

726
01:03:14,018 --> 01:03:17,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So in this manner,
you then shoot the bigger fawn</font>

727
01:03:17,401 --> 01:03:19,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then the mother last.</font>

728
01:03:23,614 --> 01:03:25,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay down!</font>

729
01:03:31,518 --> 01:03:33,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop! George!</font>

730
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:37,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">George!</font>

731
01:03:37,835 --> 01:03:40,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My family was moving
in the wrong order.</font>

732
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have always taken
ethical hunting rules</font>

733
01:03:43,668 --> 01:03:45,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">very seriously.</font>

734
01:03:45,878 --> 01:03:50,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On that point,
I think of myself as a bit of a gentleman.</font>

735
01:03:52,022 --> 01:03:53,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A gentleman, really?</font>

736
01:03:53,851 --> 01:03:55,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

737
01:03:55,197 --> 01:03:57,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or a Mr. Sophistication even?</font>

738
01:04:21,534 --> 01:04:25,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No!</font>

739
01:04:30,094 --> 01:04:31,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

740
01:05:10,464 --> 01:05:12,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">George doesn't seem to have
much of an appetite.</font>

741
01:05:15,331 --> 01:05:17,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps he'd like
some of that pie.</font>

742
01:05:25,065 --> 01:05:28,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, when I was a boy,
I never got enough pie.</font>

743
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:32,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you do as I say..</font>

744
01:05:33,867 --> 01:05:36,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and give the youngster
a little piece of pie?</font>

745
01:05:39,424 --> 01:05:41,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's if have no say
in the matter.</font>

746
01:05:48,399 --> 01:05:51,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was supposed to be
an enjoyable picnic.</font>

747
01:06:47,897 --> 01:06:49,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This has been a good day.</font>

748
01:06:53,282 --> 01:06:55,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An excellent day.</font>

749
01:06:58,494 --> 01:07:00,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have a favorite number?</font>

750
01:07:02,877 --> 01:07:04,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any number?</font>

751
01:07:06,053 --> 01:07:07,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody has
a favorite number.</font>

752
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:16,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">12.</font>

753
01:07:17,029 --> 01:07:18,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">12.</font>

754
01:07:20,688 --> 01:07:22,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's an excellent number.</font>

755
01:07:26,177 --> 01:07:27,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very good number indeed.</font>

756
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Picnic's over.</font>

757
01:07:34,254 --> 01:07:35,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can go ahead.</font>

758
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:40,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take care of the kids.</font>

759
01:07:47,784 --> 01:07:49,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1.</font>

760
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:53,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2.</font>

761
01:07:55,755 --> 01:07:57,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3.</font>

762
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4.</font>

763
01:08:02,173 --> 01:08:04,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5.</font>

764
01:08:05,106 --> 01:08:06,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6.</font>

765
01:08:08,556 --> 01:08:09,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">7.</font>

766
01:08:12,144 --> 01:08:13,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">8.</font>

767
01:08:15,492 --> 01:08:16,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">9.</font>

768
01:08:18,322 --> 01:08:19,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10.</font>

769
01:08:19,979 --> 01:08:21,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">11.</font>

01:08:23,396 --> 01:08:25,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">12.</font>

771
01:08:55,221 --> 01:08:56,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Schweiss.</font>

772
01:08:58,914 --> 01:09:00,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly.</font>

773
01:11:09,286 --> 01:11:12,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you expect me
to praise you or applaud?</font>

774
01:11:12,082 --> 01:11:14,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I'm sad</font>

775
01:11:14,636 --> 01:11:17,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you're
so judgmental, Verge.</font>

776
01:11:17,052 --> 01:11:20,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't look at the acts,
look at the works.</font>

777
01:11:20,953 --> 01:11:22,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whole notion of trophies.</font>

778
01:11:22,541 --> 01:11:25,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no, no!</font>

779
01:11:25,578 --> 01:11:28,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're constantly
trying to manipulate me.</font>

780
01:11:28,961 --> 01:11:30,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And with children</font>

781
01:11:30,859 --> 01:11:33,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the most sensitive
subject of all.</font>

782
01:11:34,553 --> 01:11:36,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm also sensitive, Verge.</font>

783
01:11:39,661 --> 01:11:42,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot sleep on a sheet with
even the smallest wrinkle.</font>

784
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:50,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hunt, after all,
is a metaphor for love.</font>

785
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that is your weakness,
Jack.</font>

786
01:11:52,709 --> 01:11:55,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So much has happened
during those days</font>

787
01:11:55,919 --> 01:11:58,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">let's call it signs
in the sun and the moon</font>

788
01:11:58,611 --> 01:12:02,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which claimed my presence
for yet another work of art</font>

789
01:12:02,408 --> 01:12:04,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and roused my aggression.</font>

790
01:12:14,489 --> 01:12:16,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First, the eclipse.</font>

791
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:22,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then the volcanic eruption
of Mount St. Helens</font>

792
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:25,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which I could see
from my lot.</font>

793
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:28,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had just then decided
that using cinder blocks</font>

794
01:12:28,538 --> 01:12:31,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was totally, totally wrong.</font>

795
01:12:32,645 --> 01:12:34,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I decided
to change the material.</font>

796
01:12:36,442 --> 01:12:37,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The divine material.</font>

797
01:12:39,687 --> 01:12:41,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Love, Jack.</font>

798
01:12:41,654 --> 01:12:44,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Love is also an art.</font>

799
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:46,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not to mention intimacy.</font>

800
01:12:51,664 --> 01:12:54,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Iceman always inhaled
his victims' last breath.</font>

801
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jack!</font>

802
01:12:56,462 --> 01:12:58,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Not your brain
it's just the flame<i></font>

803
01:12:58,775 --> 01:13:00,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That burns your change
to keep you<i></font>

804
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:02,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Insane Insane<i></font>



806
01:14:50,956 --> 01:14:52,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Verge?</font>

807
01:14:52,371 --> 01:14:54,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here, Jack.</font>

808
01:15:05,073 --> 01:15:06,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't feel so good, Verge.</font>

809
01:15:11,079 --> 01:15:13,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a sour taste
in my mouth.</font>

810
01:15:14,013 --> 01:15:17,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want me to show you the
way to the next whiskey bar?</font>

811
01:15:21,538 --> 01:15:24,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the acid
you are starting to taste.</font>

812
01:15:26,336 --> 01:15:28,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It appears at this depth.</font>

813
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:34,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm afraid you are going
to have to get used to it.</font>

814
01:15:53,808 --> 01:15:56,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I placed Grumpy
in the anteroom..</font>

815
01:15:58,571 --> 01:16:01,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and left him there
until rigor mortis</font>

816
01:16:01,091 --> 01:16:02,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">had disappeared.</font>

817
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:07,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a plan
for little Grumpy.</font>

818
01:16:09,133 --> 01:16:10,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does that mean?</font>

819
01:16:13,517 --> 01:16:17,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those who are really good
at taxidermy</font>

820
01:16:17,383 --> 01:16:19,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can make the animals
look alive</font>

821
01:16:19,972 --> 01:16:22,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by changing their expressions
and positions</font>

822
01:16:24,286 --> 01:16:27,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so it becomes
a whole little scene.</font>

823
01:16:39,669 --> 01:16:43,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I discovered that if I worked
around rigor mortis</font>

824
01:16:43,638 --> 01:16:46,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and worked before
the corpses froze</font>

825
01:16:46,538 --> 01:16:50,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I could manipulate
their expressions</font>

826
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:53,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and positions with
steel wire, pins, tape</font>

827
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:55,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and things like that.</font>

828
01:16:55,961 --> 01:16:57,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then when they were frozen</font>

829
01:16:57,963 --> 01:17:00,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">remove it all
and have a nearly</font>

830
01:17:00,345 --> 01:17:02,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">credible human being.</font>

831
01:17:03,278 --> 01:17:06,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grumpy was grumpy no more.</font>

832
01:17:06,926 --> 01:17:09,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was that what you were after?</font>

833
01:17:09,722 --> 01:17:12,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A completely credible
human being?</font>

834
01:17:12,932 --> 01:17:16,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without becoming too romantic,
might one say</font>

835
01:17:16,177 --> 01:17:19,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that exactly that
is reminiscent</font>

836
01:17:19,456 --> 01:17:22,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of a kind of desire
for love?</font>

837
01:17:24,114 --> 01:17:26,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a romance.</font>

838
01:17:45,859 --> 01:17:48,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did the crutch
come from, Jack?</font>

839
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:52,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hadn't hurt yourself,
had you?</font>

840
01:17:52,211 --> 01:17:55,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A very useful little trick
if you wish to look harmless.</font>

841
01:17:55,938 --> 01:18:00,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In general, if you carry some
luggage and a crutch</font>

842
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:02,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">people come running
to assist</font>

843
01:18:02,773 --> 01:18:05,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then you force them
into the car with a weapon.</font>

844
01:18:05,258 --> 01:18:07,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does that
have to do with love?</font>

845
01:18:10,401 --> 01:18:13,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really had strong feelings
for this one</font>

846
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:17,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">much stronger than a psychopath
should be able to have.</font>

847
01:18:26,969 --> 01:18:28,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smile.</font>

848
01:18:40,707 --> 01:18:41,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

849
01:18:46,265 --> 01:18:47,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Talk to me.</font>

850
01:18:48,681 --> 01:18:50,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't.</font>

851
01:18:51,339 --> 01:18:53,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate the way you look at me.</font>

852
01:18:59,588 --> 01:19:01,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The way I look at you?</font>

853
01:19:04,904 --> 01:19:06,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

854
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:46,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you tell me
what's on your mind now?</font>

855
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:55,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just don't know
where I've got you.</font>

856
01:19:57,267 --> 01:19:59,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you trying to leave me?</font>

857
01:19:59,959 --> 01:20:01,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like you're trying
to leave me.</font>

858
01:20:03,514 --> 01:20:05,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not going to leave you.</font>

859
01:20:07,311 --> 01:20:08,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm right here.</font>

860
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:18,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You feel that?</font>

861
01:20:21,429 --> 01:20:24,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm right here,
on the other end of the line.</font>

862
01:20:30,714 --> 01:20:32,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang up for a second.</font>

863
01:20:43,244 --> 01:20:45,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello.
- Who am I speaking with?</font>

864
01:20:50,354 --> 01:20:52,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know who
you are speaking with.</font>

865
01:20:55,773 --> 01:20:57,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I'd never leave you.</font>

866
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:01,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now what do you say?</font>

867
01:21:04,955 --> 01:21:06,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you think we deserve
a drink?</font>

868
01:21:09,546 --> 01:21:11,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

869
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:12,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be over shortly
for cocktails.</font>

870
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:20,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I went down</font>

871
01:21:20,281 --> 01:21:23,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>To St. James Infirmary<i></font>

872
01:21:25,803 --> 01:21:27,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Simple?</font>

873
01:21:29,669 --> 01:21:31,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I hate it
when you call me Simple.</font>

874
01:21:31,602 --> 01:21:34,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Jacqueline.</font>

875
01:21:34,225 --> 01:21:35,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacqueline?</font>

876
01:21:37,194 --> 01:21:40,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did old Mr. and Mrs. Simple really
have that vivid an imagination?</font>

877
01:21:43,062 --> 01:21:45,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacqueline..
I bet they got that</font>

878
01:21:45,754 --> 01:21:49,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">right out of "The New York Times"
crossword puzzle.</font>

879
01:21:49,102 --> 01:21:52,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To me, your name is
Simple, simple.</font>

880
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:58,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you've got great tits.</font>

881
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:01,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you always
have to be so crude?</font>

882
01:22:03,116 --> 01:22:05,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What..</font>

883
01:22:05,878 --> 01:22:07,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that being crude?</font>

884
01:22:07,949 --> 01:22:09,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think
I was being crude.</font>

885
01:22:11,573 --> 01:22:13,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you figured out
the difference between</font>

886
01:22:13,368 --> 01:22:14,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lions and tigers?</font>

887
01:22:18,408 --> 01:22:20,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tigers have stripes.</font>

888
01:22:20,202 --> 01:22:21,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And where do they live?</font>

889
01:22:24,379 --> 01:22:25,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Africa?</font>

890
01:22:30,661 --> 01:22:33,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the difference between
an architect and an engineer?</font>

891
01:22:36,909 --> 01:22:38,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Architect draws houses?</font>

892
01:22:41,051 --> 01:22:42,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And an engineer?</font>

893
01:22:48,541 --> 01:22:50,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also draws houses?</font>

894
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:53,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You call that a difference?</font>

895
01:22:55,065 --> 01:22:58,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An engineer reads music,
an architect plays music</font>

896
01:22:58,793 --> 01:23:02,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if that's something your
limited brain can process.</font>

897
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:08,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you always
have to be so cruel?</font>

898
01:23:10,356 --> 01:23:12,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not completely stupid.</font>

899
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:15,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That fucking depends on your
definition of "Completely."</font>

900
01:23:20,918 --> 01:23:22,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we just talk
about something normal?</font>

901
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:23,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Like..
- Like?</font>

902
01:23:23,714 --> 01:23:25,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you do,
something like that?</font>

903
01:23:25,336 --> 01:23:27,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Information about what I do.</font>

904
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:32,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In simple terms that
a simpleton can understand</font>

905
01:23:32,654 --> 01:23:34,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is that right, Simple?</font>

906
01:23:35,968 --> 01:23:37,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

907
01:23:42,008 --> 01:23:43,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I kill.</font>

908
01:23:46,288 --> 01:23:47,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

909
01:23:52,536 --> 01:23:55,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've killed 60 people.</font>

910
01:23:57,645 --> 01:23:59,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a serial killer, Simple.</font>

911
01:24:02,373 --> 01:24:04,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're weird.</font>

912
01:24:04,652 --> 01:24:07,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm weird?</font>

913
01:24:07,137 --> 01:24:10,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why, because I'm saying that
I've killed 61 people?</font>

914
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:13,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said 60 before.</font>

915
01:24:17,630 --> 01:24:21,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you weren't as dumb
as a fucking doorknob</font>

916
01:24:21,738 --> 01:24:24,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you would be familiar
with the term "Updated."</font>

917
01:24:26,846 --> 01:24:30,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just because the number
was 60 an hour ago</font>

918
01:24:30,885 --> 01:24:33,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">doesn't mean that
it can't easily become</font>

919
01:24:34,026 --> 01:24:36,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">61 in just
a couple of minutes.</font>

920
01:24:36,546 --> 01:24:38,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm not dumb
as a doorknob.</font>

921
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:42,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I haven't
read as many books as you.</font>

922
01:24:42,275 --> 01:24:44,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Simple, come on.</font>

923
01:24:44,726 --> 01:24:46,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're as dumb as fuck.</font>

924
01:24:48,558 --> 01:24:50,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now why don't you be
a good little dreamboat</font>

925
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:52,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and go get me a magic marker.</font>

926
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:54,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could you bring me
a magic marker?</font>

927
01:24:57,290 --> 01:24:58,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Red or black?</font>

928
01:24:59,534 --> 01:25:01,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">E... either one's fine.</font>

929
01:26:44,743 --> 01:26:46,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're fucking weird.</font>

930
01:27:02,519 --> 01:27:03,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

931
01:27:03,693 --> 01:27:05,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Officer.
- Yeah.</font>

932
01:27:05,798 --> 01:27:08,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friend is, like,
totally weird</font>

933
01:27:08,629 --> 01:27:11,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he said he killed
60 people</font>

934
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:13,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or maybe even 61.</font>

935
01:27:13,668 --> 01:27:15,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you been drinking?</font>

936
01:27:15,532 --> 01:27:18,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, yeah.</font>

937
01:27:18,708 --> 01:27:19,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then stop.</font>

938
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:24,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything that this woman
has said..</font>

939
01:27:25,749 --> 01:27:27,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...is true.</font>

940
01:27:30,271 --> 01:27:32,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have killed 60 people!</font>

941
01:27:33,688 --> 01:27:36,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">60 people!</font>

942
01:27:36,242 --> 01:27:37,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a serial killer.</font>

943
01:27:37,727 --> 01:27:40,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please help me.</font>

944
01:27:40,626 --> 01:27:43,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've also been
a horrible human being..</font>

945
01:27:45,838 --> 01:27:47,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...to this woman right here..</font>

946
01:27:51,223 --> 01:27:53,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...Ms. Jacqueline.</font>

947
01:27:57,850 --> 01:28:01,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss, would you be kind enough
to sweep up your friend here</font>

948
01:28:01,405 --> 01:28:03,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and take him back inside?</font>

949
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't order you both
to stop drinking</font>

950
01:28:05,099 --> 01:28:06,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I would recommend it.</font>

951
01:28:41,342 --> 01:28:43,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can never make it up to you.</font>

952
01:28:45,139 --> 01:28:47,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never be able
to make it up to you.</font>

953
01:29:02,432 --> 01:29:03,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you forgive me?</font>

954
01:29:06,263 --> 01:29:07,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

955
01:29:11,613 --> 01:29:13,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I forgive you.</font>

956
01:29:19,035 --> 01:29:22,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.
Let's go inside.</font>

957
01:29:27,837 --> 01:29:30,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need some pills.</font>

958
01:29:30,184 --> 01:29:32,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a friend
who's got some good pills.</font>

959
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:15,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you leaving?</font>

960
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:23,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just gonna go
get some pills.</font>

961
01:31:31,581 --> 01:31:34,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have my... my keys?</font>

962
01:31:34,584 --> 01:31:37,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna take
some random pills.</font>

963
01:31:41,453 --> 01:31:44,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I really think
I deserve better than this.</font>

964
01:31:48,632 --> 01:31:50,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna hang on to the keys.</font>

965
01:31:53,568 --> 01:31:56,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a bad habit for you to</font>

966
01:31:56,054 --> 01:31:58,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">go rushing downstairs
every time</font>

967
01:31:58,608 --> 01:32:00,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we start to have,
have a good time.</font>

968
01:32:02,508 --> 01:32:03,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right?</font>

969
01:32:06,823 --> 01:32:09,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're walking
without your crutch.</font>

970
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you weren't
using it downstairs either.</font>

971
01:32:34,057 --> 01:32:37,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're Mr. Sophistication,
aren't you?</font>

972
01:32:42,272 --> 01:32:44,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you feel like screaming..</font>

973
01:32:45,655 --> 01:32:47,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...I definitely think
that you should.</font>

974
01:33:06,607 --> 01:33:08,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You call that screaming?</font>

975
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:12,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help! Help!</font>

976
01:33:14,304 --> 01:33:15,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help!</font>

977
01:33:15,961 --> 01:33:18,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, help!</font>

978
01:33:18,067 --> 01:33:20,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a murderer
in the building!</font>

979
01:33:20,655 --> 01:33:22,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Mr. Sophistication!</font>

980
01:33:22,623 --> 01:33:25,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help!</font>

981
01:33:25,108 --> 01:33:27,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help!</font>

982
01:33:29,112 --> 01:33:30,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh!</font>

983
01:33:32,150 --> 01:33:34,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh! Hey.</font>

984
01:33:34,497 --> 01:33:35,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Hey.</font>

985
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh!</font>

986
01:33:49,891 --> 01:33:52,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you hear?</font>

987
01:33:52,239 --> 01:33:54,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you hear anything?</font>

988
01:33:54,758 --> 01:33:57,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you hear anybody
running downstairs to help?</font>

989
01:34:02,145 --> 01:34:04,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some neighbors you have.</font>

990
01:34:04,768 --> 01:34:06,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to try the window?</font>

991
01:34:06,736 --> 01:34:08,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want my keys.</font>

992
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:13,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want my keys.</font>

993
01:34:13,639 --> 01:34:15,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want my keys.</font>

994
01:34:16,470 --> 01:34:18,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help!</font>

995
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:21,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help!</font>

996
01:34:22,752 --> 01:34:25,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me!</font>

997
01:34:26,825 --> 01:34:29,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please help me!</font>

998
01:34:44,291 --> 01:34:47,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, maybe I'm mistaken,
but..</font>

999
01:34:47,811 --> 01:34:49,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...as far as I can tell..</font>

1000
01:34:51,367 --> 01:34:54,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...not a single light
has gone on</font>

1001
01:34:54,715 --> 01:34:57,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in any apartment or stairwell.</font>

1002
01:34:57,580 --> 01:34:58,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know why that is?</font>

1003
01:35:00,307 --> 01:35:03,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause in this hell of a town..</font>

1004
01:35:05,519 --> 01:35:07,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...in this hell of a country..</font>

1005
01:35:09,316 --> 01:35:14,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...in this hell of a world,
nobody wants to help!</font>

1006
01:35:19,498 --> 01:35:22,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can scream..</font>

1007
01:35:22,294 --> 01:35:25,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...from now until Christmas Eve</font>

1008
01:35:25,608 --> 01:35:28,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the only answer
you'll get</font>

1009
01:35:28,818 --> 01:35:31,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is the deafening silence
that you're hearing right now.</font>

1010
01:35:46,318 --> 01:35:48,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't we talk?</font>

1011
01:35:49,908 --> 01:35:52,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a time for talking</font>

1012
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:55,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a time for being quiet.</font>

1013
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open your mouth.</font>

1014
01:35:57,743 --> 01:35:59,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open your mouth!</font>

1015
01:36:33,503 --> 01:36:34,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Simple.</font>

1016
01:36:35,022 --> 01:36:38,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm sorry,
Ms. Jacqueline.</font>

1017
01:36:38,267 --> 01:36:41,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, it's time..</font>

1018
01:36:43,133 --> 01:36:44,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...for you to choose a knife.</font>

1019
01:36:46,171 --> 01:36:48,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All you have to do is nod.</font>

1020
01:36:51,038 --> 01:36:52,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No?</font>

1021
01:36:55,180 --> 01:36:56,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about this one?</font>

1022
01:36:57,769 --> 01:36:59,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't like
that one either?</font>

1023
01:36:59,598 --> 01:37:00,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1024
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:04,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about this one?</font>

1025
01:37:07,019 --> 01:37:08,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

1026
01:37:10,230 --> 01:37:11,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well..</font>

1027
01:37:13,957 --> 01:37:16,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...that's an interesting
choice, Simple.</font>

1028
01:37:27,523 --> 01:37:29,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know..</font>

1029
01:37:30,905 --> 01:37:34,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...there is something that has been
bothering Mr. Sophistication..</font>

1030
01:37:37,257 --> 01:37:39,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...for quite a bit.</font>

1031
01:37:39,638 --> 01:37:42,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And perhaps it's more
interesting to him..</font>

1032
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:45,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...than it would be to you.</font>

1033
01:37:48,233 --> 01:37:50,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But to be honest</font>

1034
01:37:50,787 --> 01:37:53,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he gets pretty fuckin' pissed
when he thinks about it.</font>

1035
01:37:55,102 --> 01:37:58,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is it always
the man's fault?</font>

1036
01:38:00,970 --> 01:38:04,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No matter where you go</font>

1037
01:38:04,284 --> 01:38:08,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's like you're some sort of
wandering guilty person.</font>

1038
01:38:11,463 --> 01:38:15,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without even having harmed
a single kitten.</font>

1039
01:38:19,368 --> 01:38:21,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I actually get sad
when I think about it.</font>

1040
01:38:27,617 --> 01:38:30,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If one is so unfortunate..</font>

1041
01:38:32,898 --> 01:38:36,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...as to have been born male..</font>

1042
01:38:38,007 --> 01:38:40,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...then you're also born guilty.</font>

1043
01:38:42,494 --> 01:38:44,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think of the injustice in that.</font>

1044
01:38:47,361 --> 01:38:49,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Women are always
the victims, right?</font>

1045
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:57,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And men, they are always
the criminals.</font>

1046
01:39:21,875 --> 01:39:24,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Told you before,
this is private property.</font>

1047
01:39:27,364 --> 01:39:28,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to leave.</font>

1048
01:39:33,128 --> 01:39:36,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the king's horses
and all the king's men</font>

1049
01:39:36,614 --> 01:39:39,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">couldn't put Simple
back together again.</font>

1050
01:39:41,964 --> 01:39:44,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are they always so stupid?</font>

1051
01:39:45,278 --> 01:39:47,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's stupid?</font>

1052
01:39:47,107 --> 01:39:52,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the women you kill strike
me as seriously unintelligent.</font>

1053
01:39:52,112 --> 01:39:53,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1054
01:39:53,528 --> 01:39:55,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've also killed men.</font>

1055
01:39:55,357 --> 01:39:58,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you only talk
about the stupid women</font>

1056
01:39:58,602 --> 01:40:02,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">unless you think
all women are stupid.</font>

1057
01:40:02,571 --> 01:40:05,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, the stories I've told
were selected at random, but...</font>

1058
01:40:05,850 --> 01:40:09,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You feel superior to women
and want to brag?</font>

1059
01:40:09,992 --> 01:40:12,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It turns you on,
doesn't it, Jack?</font>

1060
01:40:12,857 --> 01:40:15,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no,
but women are easier.</font>

1061
01:40:15,377 --> 01:40:18,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not physically, they're
just easier to work with.</font>

1062
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:20,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More cooperative.</font>

1063
01:40:20,106 --> 01:40:21,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To kill, you mean.</font>

1064
01:40:21,935 --> 01:40:23,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you like.</font>

1065
01:40:24,696 --> 01:40:27,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Sophistication believes
in that theory.</font>

1066
01:40:27,353 --> 01:40:32,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Mr. Sophistication
is, uh, the theoretician?</font>

1067
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:33,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can tell
you're lapping it up</font>

1068
01:40:33,601 --> 01:40:36,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I tell you about
Mr. Sophistication.</font>

1069
01:40:36,259 --> 01:40:38,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"So Jack hears voices</font>

1070
01:40:38,503 --> 01:40:41,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"that order him
to do this or do that.</font>

1071
01:40:41,264 --> 01:40:43,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jack must be psychotic."</font>

1072
01:40:43,404 --> 01:40:46,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I loathe diagnosis you can
just write down in letters.</font>

1073
01:40:48,202 --> 01:40:52,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not fair,
the letters are clear.</font>

1074
01:40:52,102 --> 01:40:54,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They look after us
and create boundaries</font>

1075
01:40:54,933 --> 01:40:58,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">between good and evil,
and they carry religion.</font>

1076
01:40:58,626 --> 01:41:01,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Religion has ruined
human beings</font>

1077
01:41:01,422 --> 01:41:05,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because your God teaches people
to deny the tiger in themselves</font>

1078
01:41:05,219 --> 01:41:08,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and turns us all
into a throng of slaves</font>

1079
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:10,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">too shameful to acknowledge it.</font>

1080
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Jack, you should have read</font>

1081
01:41:12,709 --> 01:41:15,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the right letters in your life</font>

1082
01:41:15,298 --> 01:41:17,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you didn't want to.</font>



1085
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:30,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The collection of corpses were
mostly frozen</font>

1086
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:31,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">shortly after death</font>

1087
01:41:31,590 --> 01:41:34,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">however, I think a handful
of them, by chance</font>

1088
01:41:34,455 --> 01:41:38,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">had reached, uh, at least, a
certain degree of putrefaction</font>

1089
01:41:38,977 --> 01:41:41,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before I managed
to get them on ice.</font>

1090
01:41:41,531 --> 01:41:45,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you say if putrefaction
is good or evil?</font>

1091
01:41:45,431 --> 01:41:48,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most people would say,
it's the natural breakdown</font>

1092
01:41:48,607 --> 01:41:51,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which, in the end,
is a reaction of matter</font>

1093
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:53,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is the basis for life
on earth.</font>

1094
01:41:53,957 --> 01:41:56,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thereby, it's neither
particularly good nor evil</font>

1095
01:41:56,788 --> 01:41:59,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that a human being must be
perceived as alive</font>

1096
01:41:59,722 --> 01:42:02,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you're to describe
that person's qualities</font>

1097
01:42:02,552 --> 01:42:05,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and identify that person's
ultimate goal.</font>

1098
01:42:05,728 --> 01:42:08,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this is where
Mr. Sophistication</font>

1099
01:42:08,385 --> 01:42:11,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has a very different opinion.</font>

1100
01:42:11,354 --> 01:42:14,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He argues quite well
that the ultimate goal</font>

1101
01:42:14,115 --> 01:42:17,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the human being
is not prior to death</font>

1102
01:42:17,187 --> 01:42:18,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but after.</font>

1103
01:42:18,741 --> 01:42:22,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You reduce everything human
to matter</font>

1104
01:42:22,123 --> 01:42:25,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that way life disappears
and along with it art</font>

1105
01:42:25,782 --> 01:42:28,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which you value so highly.</font>

1106
01:42:28,233 --> 01:42:32,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Verge, you're a bitter
old bastard.</font>

1107
01:42:32,202 --> 01:42:36,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You kill art by imposing
your moral ruler on life</font>

1108
01:42:36,448 --> 01:42:37,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which I want to free</font>

1109
01:42:38,001 --> 01:42:40,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because art is so immeasurably
vaster</font>

1110
01:42:40,659 --> 01:42:42,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than we will ever understand.</font>

1111
01:42:42,350 --> 01:42:44,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May I illustrate now?</font>

1112
01:42:44,145 --> 01:42:47,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no avoiding it,
is there?</font>

1113
01:42:52,119 --> 01:42:55,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have a handle on
how many processes take part</font>

1114
01:42:55,501 --> 01:42:58,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the decay of a dead human</font>

1115
01:42:58,366 --> 01:43:00,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I know a bit
about dessert wines.</font>

1116
01:43:02,370 --> 01:43:05,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In order to achieve
the most sublime sweetness</font>

1117
01:43:05,201 --> 01:43:07,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the greatest wines,
nature has provided us</font>

1118
01:43:07,721 --> 01:43:09,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with various methods.</font>

1119
01:43:10,551 --> 01:43:14,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The 3 most common forms
of decomposition are</font>

1120
01:43:14,141 --> 01:43:16,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">frost..</font>

1121
01:43:16,074 --> 01:43:18,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...dehydration..</font>

1122
01:43:18,041 --> 01:43:19,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and a fungus
with the enticingly</font>

1123
01:43:19,733 --> 01:43:22,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">mysterious name,
the noble rot.</font>

1124
01:43:29,639 --> 01:43:32,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The first method is the one
that in Germany</font>

1125
01:43:32,331 --> 01:43:34,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is used to produce "Eiswein."</font>

1126
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:36,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The method
quite simply entails</font>

1127
01:43:36,991 --> 01:43:39,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">leaving the grapes on the vine
for so long</font>

1128
01:43:39,338 --> 01:43:43,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that they are exposed to frost
for a certain number of nights</font>

1129
01:43:43,101 --> 01:43:44,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before they are pressed.</font>

1130
01:43:44,585 --> 01:43:47,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This method increases
the sugar content</font>

1131
01:43:47,277 --> 01:43:49,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the wine dramatically.</font>

1132
01:43:49,659 --> 01:43:53,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is very risky,
as the grapes must have certain qualities</font>

1133
01:43:53,525 --> 01:43:56,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in order to be able to
withstand the process.</font>

1134
01:43:56,597 --> 01:43:58,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On top of that,
there can be uncertainty</font>

1135
01:43:58,703 --> 01:44:01,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about whether or not the first
night's frost</font>

1136
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:05,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lives up precisely to the
expectations, et cetera.</font>

1137
01:44:05,641 --> 01:44:08,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The second method
is called "Trockenbeeren"</font>

1138
01:44:08,954 --> 01:44:11,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in which the grapes are
allowed to hang on the vine</font>

1139
01:44:11,543 --> 01:44:15,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until they dry up and very
nearly become raisins.</font>

1140
01:44:15,996 --> 01:44:18,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The last method,
which, for example</font>

1141
01:44:18,343 --> 01:44:21,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is essential for the
production of Sauternes</font>

1142
01:44:21,449 --> 01:44:23,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a kind of mold
that causes grapes</font>

1143
01:44:23,693 --> 01:44:25,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be very full-bodied</font>

1144
01:44:25,799 --> 01:44:30,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and have an explosively high
sugar content.</font>

1145
01:44:30,079 --> 01:44:32,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could say about
all three processes</font>

1146
01:44:32,495 --> 01:44:34,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that it's the breakdown
that lifts the living grape</font>

1147
01:44:34,635 --> 01:44:36,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">up to be a part of an artwork.</font>

1148
01:44:37,914 --> 01:44:40,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can view the processes
that start in a human being</font>

1149
01:44:40,986 --> 01:44:43,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after death in the same manner.</font>

1150
01:44:43,230 --> 01:44:48,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Says you! And I still say that
without love there is no art.</font>

1151
01:44:48,304 --> 01:44:51,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not up for debate.</font>

1152
01:44:51,065 --> 01:44:53,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The thing you are talking
about with the grapes</font>

1153
01:44:53,758 --> 01:44:57,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is just nature's
method of decomposing.</font>

1154
01:44:57,313 --> 01:45:01,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If decomposition
is a way to salvation</font>

1155
01:45:01,766 --> 01:45:03,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then what about your house?</font>

1156
01:45:05,148 --> 01:45:07,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By God, you cannot convince me</font>

1157
01:45:07,564 --> 01:45:10,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that the idea of your first
house being torn down</font>

1158
01:45:10,671 --> 01:45:13,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was, in any way, satisfying.</font>

1159
01:45:13,053 --> 01:45:16,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you claim that
it was built to be torn down?</font>

1160
01:45:18,127 --> 01:45:20,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, of course it wasn't ideal</font>

1161
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:22,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm sorry to say
that it happened</font>

1162
01:45:22,510 --> 01:45:24,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no less than three more times</font>

1163
01:45:24,616 --> 01:45:28,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I started construction
and then became doubtful.</font>

1164
01:45:28,171 --> 01:45:30,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was difficult to create
the house</font>

1165
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:31,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I had dreamed of.</font>

1166
01:45:31,899 --> 01:45:34,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The material didn't do
what I wanted it to do.</font>

1167
01:45:34,902 --> 01:45:37,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The houses I had drawn
had already</font>

1168
01:45:37,491 --> 01:45:39,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at the very first detail,
something banal</font>

1169
01:45:39,942 --> 01:45:41,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not to say ordinary,
about them</font>

1170
01:45:41,978 --> 01:45:46,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't that what in art
you would call epigonism?</font>

1171
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:49,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your great talent
only reached so far</font>

1172
01:45:49,641 --> 01:45:52,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you, artist of all times.</font>

1173
01:45:53,541 --> 01:45:56,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you were writing,
didn't you yourself plan</font>

1174
01:45:56,406 --> 01:45:59,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the destruction of your most
popular literary work?</font>

1175
01:46:00,307 --> 01:46:02,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The Aeneid"
was a commissioned work</font>

1176
01:46:02,827 --> 01:46:07,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where the ruling power and
its ideas were glorified by me</font>

1177
01:46:07,210 --> 01:46:11,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the point
where it was no longer art.</font>

1178
01:46:11,145 --> 01:46:14,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if glorification
could demean a work..</font>

1179
01:46:15,943 --> 01:46:17,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...why should destruction
and demolition</font>

1180
01:46:18,014 --> 01:46:21,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not be able to do the opposite
and create art?</font>

1181
01:46:23,364 --> 01:46:26,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Albert Speer invented
"The Theory of Ruin Value"</font>

1182
01:46:26,609 --> 01:46:29,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by examining the Greek
and Roman ruins</font>

1183
01:46:29,370 --> 01:46:32,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and constructed his buildings
using both weaker</font>

1184
01:46:32,857 --> 01:46:34,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and stronger materials</font>

1185
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:37,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so that they, in a thousand
years, would appear</font>

1186
01:46:37,344 --> 01:46:39,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as aesthetically perfect ruins.</font>

1187
01:46:40,761 --> 01:46:43,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which fortunately
were smashed to atoms</font>

expression.</font>

1191
01:46:54,292 --> 01:46:56,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But an artist must be cynical</font>

1192
01:46:56,259 --> 01:47:00,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and not worry about the welfare
of humans or Gods in his art.</font>

01:47:00,505 --> 01:47:02,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This talk about
the value of ruins</font>

1194
01:47:02,748 --> 01:47:06,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">makes it too obvious, not to
mention, another subject.</font>

most beautiful airplane</font>

eerily sophisticated detail.</font>

what I'm talking about.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, by God
that has never interested me</font>

1201
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:43,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but do tell me about it.</font>

1202
01:47:43,859 --> 01:47:45,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Stuka was a dive-bomber.</font>

1203
01:47:45,722 --> 01:47:47,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They say that the pilots
actually passed out</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the detail per favore.</font>

1206
01:47:53,316 --> 01:47:54,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fantastic.</font>

1207

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Incomparable.</font>

1208
01:47:56,388 --> 01:47:59,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Notice the sound
when the plane dives.</font>

1209
01:47:59,115 --> 01:48:01,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The screeching sound.</font>

1210
01:48:01,566 --> 01:48:05,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A result of poor design
if you ask me.</font>

01:48:05,432 --> 01:48:08,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Poor design, please.</font>

1212
01:48:08,366 --> 01:48:12,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the contrary,
the screeching was intrinsic</font>

1213
01:48:12,404 --> 01:48:15,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sirens were attached to
the undercarriage of the plane</font>

01:48:15,856 --> 01:48:20,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">purposely designed as a
psychological act of war.</font>

1215
01:48:20,826 --> 01:48:24,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one who heard it in action
will ever forget that sound.</font>

01:48:25,003 --> 01:48:27,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It made the blood run cold
in everyone's veins.</font>

1217
01:48:28,869 --> 01:48:30,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Known as Jericho's Trumpet.</font>

1218
01:48:32,977 --> 01:48:35,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sadistic, but in your eyes</font>

1219
01:48:35,807 --> 01:48:38,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">probably a masterpiece.</font>

1220
01:48:38,223 --> 01:48:42,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, more than a masterpiece.</font>

1221
01:48:42,676 --> 01:48:44,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An icon.</font>

1222
01:48:44,712 --> 01:48:47,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The person or persons,
who conceived the Stuka</font>

1223
01:48:47,577 --> 01:48:51,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and its functions,
were icon-creators.</font>

1224
01:48:51,064 --> 01:48:52,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I'm getting at is this</font>

1225
01:48:52,928 --> 01:48:54,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as disinclined
as the world is</font>

1226
01:48:54,688 --> 01:48:57,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to acknowledge
the beauty of decay</font>

1227
01:48:57,691 --> 01:49:01,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's just as disinclined
to give credit to those</font>

1228
01:49:01,074 --> 01:49:03,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no credit to us</font>

1229
01:49:03,628 --> 01:49:06,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who create the real icons
of this planet.</font>

1230
01:49:07,701 --> 01:49:09,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are deemed
the ultimate evil.</font>

1231
01:49:13,638 --> 01:49:17,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the icons that have had
and always will have</font>

1232
01:49:17,883 --> 01:49:19,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an impact on the world</font>

1233
01:49:19,575 --> 01:49:22,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are for me extravagant art.</font>

1234
01:49:34,486 --> 01:49:36,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The noble rot.</font>

1235
01:49:36,178 --> 01:49:40,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it... you Antichrist!</font>

1236
01:49:40,492 --> 01:49:42,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't recall ever having
escorted</font>

1237
01:49:43,012 --> 01:49:47,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a so thoroughly depraved
person as you, Jack.</font>

1238
01:49:50,485 --> 01:49:53,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since you have now apparently
set your heart</font>

1239
01:49:53,729 --> 01:49:56,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in mass extermination</font>

1240
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:58,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">let me make a brief comment</font>

1241
01:49:58,527 --> 01:50:01,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about the Buchenwald camp</font>

1242
01:50:01,081 --> 01:50:06,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that emphasizes my attitude
towards art and love.</font>

1243
01:50:06,328 --> 01:50:10,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the middle of this
concentration camp stood a tree</font>

1244
01:50:10,608 --> 01:50:13,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and not just any old tree,
but an oak</font>

1245
01:50:13,369 --> 01:50:16,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and not just any oak,
but the one Goethe</font>

1246
01:50:17,028 --> 01:50:18,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when he was young,
sat beneath</font>

1247
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:23,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and wrote some of humanity's
most important works.</font>

1248
01:50:23,483 --> 01:50:24,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goethe.</font>

1249
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:27,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here you can talk about
masterpieces</font>

1250
01:50:27,418 --> 01:50:30,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the value of icons.</font>

1251
01:50:30,110 --> 01:50:33,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The personification
of humanism, dignity</font>

1252
01:50:33,873 --> 01:50:38,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">culture and goodness
was by the irony of faith</font>

1253
01:50:38,671 --> 01:50:40,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">suddenly present</font>

1254
01:50:40,776 --> 01:50:43,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the middle of one
of the all time</font>

1255
01:50:43,434 --> 01:50:46,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">greatest crimes
against humanity.</font>

1256
01:50:48,370 --> 01:50:50,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some people claim
that the atrocities we commit</font>

1257
01:50:51,028 --> 01:50:53,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in our fiction
are those inner desires</font>

1258
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:57,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which we cannot commit in our
controlled civilization.</font>

1259
01:50:57,862 --> 01:51:01,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So they are expressed instead
through our art.</font>

1260
01:51:01,210 --> 01:51:03,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't agree.</font>

1261
01:51:03,178 --> 01:51:06,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe heaven and hell
are one and the same.</font>

1262
01:51:06,457 --> 01:51:10,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The soul belongs to heaven
and the body to hell.</font>

1263
01:51:10,737 --> 01:51:15,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The soul is reason and the body
is all the dangerous things</font>

1264
01:51:15,431 --> 01:51:18,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for example art and icons.</font>

1265
01:51:22,369 --> 01:51:24,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me finish
with a curiosity.</font>

1266
01:51:26,373 --> 01:51:28,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've always considered it
ridiculous</font>

1267
01:51:28,065 --> 01:51:29,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I've heard about the
serial killer's</font>

1268
01:51:29,929 --> 01:51:31,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">favorite trophy.</font>

1269
01:51:31,793 --> 01:51:33,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here you are, Jack.</font>

1270
01:51:34,761 --> 01:51:38,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yet I let myself be
tempted to not let</font>

1271
01:51:38,075 --> 01:51:40,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Simple's other breast
go to waste</font>

1272
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:42,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but have it prepared and sown.</font>

1273
01:51:42,907 --> 01:51:44,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also a small icon.</font>

1274
01:51:46,152 --> 01:51:47,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, sir.</font>

1275
01:52:14,939 --> 01:52:16,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you wanna fucking die?</font>

1276
01:52:18,909 --> 01:52:21,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Then do what I fucking say.</font>

1277
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do what I say!</font>

1278
01:52:28,953 --> 01:52:30,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unlock it.</font>

1279
01:52:32,232 --> 01:52:33,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop the keys.</font>

1280
01:52:34,856 --> 01:52:36,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn around.</font>

1281
01:52:38,756 --> 01:52:39,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cuff.</font>

1282
01:52:40,862 --> 01:52:41,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cuff!</font>

1283
01:53:18,934 --> 01:53:20,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kneel down.</font>

1284
01:53:24,215 --> 01:53:26,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're freezing.</font>

1285
01:53:26,390 --> 01:53:28,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of the others
fainted earlier.</font>

1286
01:53:29,773 --> 01:53:31,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're dying of cold.</font>

1287
01:53:32,258 --> 01:53:33,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're dying.</font>

1288
01:53:37,504 --> 01:53:39,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? "We're freezing."</font>

1289
01:53:41,405 --> 01:53:43,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I owe you gentlemen
an explanation.</font>

1290
01:53:47,722 --> 01:53:50,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">During World War II
on the eastern front</font>

1291
01:53:50,034 --> 01:53:54,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">German soldiers had large
programs of executions</font>

1292
01:53:54,418 --> 01:53:56,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but were in short supply
of ammunition</font>

1293
01:53:56,938 --> 01:54:01,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so they experimented with the
execution of several individuals</font>

1294
01:54:01,908 --> 01:54:05,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with one,
just one single bullet.</font>

1295
01:54:05,049 --> 01:54:07,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now as a tribute
to that, uh, ingenuity..</font>

1296
01:54:09,882 --> 01:54:13,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...I'm going to conduct a small
experiment of my own.</font>

1297
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:16,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to use..</font>

1298
01:54:19,029 --> 01:54:21,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...a full metal jacket bullet</font>

1299
01:54:21,514 --> 01:54:23,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which has the capacity</font>

1300
01:54:23,343 --> 01:54:26,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to pass through each and every
one of your heads.</font>

1301
01:54:26,553 --> 01:54:29,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not something
that I would be able to do</font>

1302
01:54:29,039 --> 01:54:30,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with basic hunting ammunition.</font>

1303
01:54:33,043 --> 01:54:35,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait, wait,
wait, sir, sir.</font>

1304
01:54:35,321 --> 01:54:37,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... it's a
misunderstanding, sir.</font>

1305
01:54:37,426 --> 01:54:38,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I hear that a lot.
- No, sir.</font>

1306
01:54:38,876 --> 01:54:40,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">W... what I mean is
that you are wrong</font>

1307
01:54:40,153 --> 01:54:42,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about the ammunition, sir.</font>

1308
01:54:42,569 --> 01:54:45,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is not full metal
ammunition, sir.</font>

1309
01:54:45,745 --> 01:54:48,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a military man,
and I know, sir.</font>

1310
01:54:52,407 --> 01:54:53,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck.</font>

1311
01:54:54,823 --> 01:54:58,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right!
This is a hunting round.</font>

1312
01:55:02,451 --> 01:55:05,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This box, it's... it's
completely mislabeled.</font>

1313
01:55:05,075 --> 01:55:06,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goddammit!</font>

1314
01:55:08,906 --> 01:55:11,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive me, gentlemen,
I'm gonna have to, uh</font>

1315
01:55:11,702 --> 01:55:12,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">step out for a moment.</font>

1316
01:55:14,636 --> 01:55:18,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it's not
an ideal situation.</font>

1317
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:22,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't die on me guys, okay?</font>

1318
01:55:54,779 --> 01:55:57,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never yelled
at you before, Al</font>

1319
01:55:57,265 --> 01:55:59,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'm about to now.</font>

1320
01:55:59,439 --> 01:56:01,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does that look like to you,
what does that say there?</font>

1321
01:56:01,890 --> 01:56:05,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, 30 odd 6..</font>

1322
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:07,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 30 odd 6, that's correct.
- Yeah.</font>

1323
01:56:07,413 --> 01:56:09,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It also says full metal jacket.</font>

1324
01:56:11,451 --> 01:56:13,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when I look inside..</font>

1325
01:56:15,628 --> 01:56:17,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me a goddamn box, Al,
and this time</font>

1326
01:56:17,872 --> 01:56:21,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">make sure it's got full metal
jacket bullets in it!</font>

1327
01:56:21,945 --> 01:56:25,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it too much to fucking ask
that the contents of the box</font>

1328
01:56:25,914 --> 01:56:28,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">match what's written
on the label?</font>

1329
01:56:28,779 --> 01:56:31,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can, I can see
that the, you're right</font>

1330
01:56:31,955 --> 01:56:34,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the label doesn't
quite match the..</font>

1331
01:56:36,338 --> 01:56:37,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...uh, content.</font>

1332
01:56:37,581 --> 01:56:39,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- W... well, that's correct.
- Yeah, but..</font>

1333
01:56:39,997 --> 01:56:42,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The thing is that
what I can't see</font>

1334
01:56:42,379 --> 01:56:45,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is that the... the..</font>

1335
01:56:45,727 --> 01:56:50,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...the box was bought here
in the shop.</font>

1336
01:56:50,421 --> 01:56:51,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh..</font>

1337
01:56:51,698 --> 01:56:54,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well I buy all my shit here.</font>

1338
01:56:54,632 --> 01:56:56,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have, for 20 years.</font>

1339
01:56:56,772 --> 01:57:01,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm in here
almost every other week.</font>

1340
01:57:01,329 --> 01:57:02,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong with you, Al?</font>

1341
01:57:04,125 --> 01:57:05,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry,
I need to see a receipt.</font>

1342
01:57:06,817 --> 01:57:08,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Receipt?
- Yeah</font>

1343
01:57:08,370 --> 01:57:10,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I don't have a fuckin'
receipt.</font>

1344
01:57:10,062 --> 01:57:12,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't ever recall getting a
receipt here.</font>

1345
01:57:12,374 --> 01:57:14,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I'm in a fucking hurry.</font>

1346
01:57:14,135 --> 01:57:16,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me buy a new box.</font>

1347
01:57:16,585 --> 01:57:17,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this time make sure
it contains</font>

1348
01:57:18,001 --> 01:57:19,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">full metal jacket bullets.</font>

1349
01:57:22,074 --> 01:57:26,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, uh, c... can I just see
some ID first?</font>

1350
01:57:27,596 --> 01:57:28,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't fucking do this, Al.</font>

1351
01:57:28,977 --> 01:57:32,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The thing is, the... the law
requires that I have...</font>

1352
01:57:32,981 --> 01:57:34,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about this..</font>

1353
01:57:34,189 --> 01:57:36,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No doubt about
your... your identity...</font>

1354
01:57:36,088 --> 01:57:38,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sell me just one full metal
jacket bullet.</font>

1355
01:57:38,297 --> 01:57:40,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I, can I just ask..</font>

1356
01:57:43,026 --> 01:57:45,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...why just... one?</font>

1357
01:57:45,373 --> 01:57:47,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that will be none of your
fuckin' business.</font>

1358
01:57:47,409 --> 01:57:49,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That... that's right. I'm sor...
- Okay?</font>

1359
01:57:49,239 --> 01:57:52,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do business here because you
don't ask stupid questions.</font>

1360
01:57:52,104 --> 01:57:56,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm... I'm sorry, Jack.
I'm... I'm sorry.</font>

1361
01:57:56,315 --> 01:57:59,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shut it down, Al, go home, have a sandwich.
- Okay.</font>

1362
01:57:59,628 --> 01:58:00,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've lost
your fucking mind, Al.</font>

1363
01:58:00,975 --> 01:58:02,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm so..</font>

1364
01:58:04,047 --> 01:58:05,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Is it any wonder</font>



1366
01:58:10,053 --> 01:58:11,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck you, Al!</font>

1367
01:58:13,988 --> 01:58:18,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Is it any wonder
you are too cool to fool?<i></font>




1370
01:58:27,070 --> 01:58:29,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Got to get a rain check
on pain<i></font>


1373
01:58:53,613 --> 01:58:55,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Al's gone totally bonkers.</font>

1374
01:58:55,719 --> 01:58:58,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a full metal jacket
cartridge.</font>

1375
01:59:00,034 --> 01:59:04,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yesterday,
the police visited Al</font>

1376
01:59:04,866 --> 01:59:07,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then me</font>

1377
01:59:07,041 --> 01:59:09,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with lights and sirens</font>

1378
01:59:09,457 --> 01:59:10,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to get you.</font>

1379
01:59:12,046 --> 01:59:13,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's over now, Jack.</font>

1380
01:59:16,705 --> 01:59:17,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's over?</font>

1381
01:59:19,363 --> 01:59:21,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They know what you've done.</font>

1382
01:59:25,024 --> 01:59:26,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We..</font>

1383
01:59:26,922 --> 01:59:28,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alright, what have I done?</font>

1384
01:59:29,753 --> 01:59:31,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The robbery.</font>

1385
01:59:32,687 --> 01:59:34,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Robbery?</font>

1386
01:59:34,068 --> 01:59:36,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys better
fucking get it together.</font>

1387
01:59:36,725 --> 01:59:39,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't robbed anybody.</font>

1388
01:59:39,418 --> 01:59:41,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is ridiculous.</font>

1389
01:59:43,353 --> 01:59:46,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna call the police, Jack.</font>

1390
01:59:47,874 --> 01:59:49,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me your gun.</font>

1391
01:59:51,292 --> 01:59:53,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't run around
with guns on me.</font>

1392
01:59:53,949 --> 01:59:56,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is, this is crazy.</font>

1393
01:59:56,607 --> 01:59:58,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit yourself down, Jack.</font>

1394
02:00:11,898 --> 02:00:13,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is S.P.</font>

1395
02:00:15,454 --> 02:00:17,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna get ahold of Rob.</font>

1396
02:00:22,944 --> 02:00:24,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, when you get hold of him,
you'll tell him</font>

1397
02:00:24,911 --> 02:00:26,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to get over here straight away.</font>

1398
02:00:28,777 --> 02:00:30,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've caught Jack.</font>

1399
02:00:38,891 --> 02:00:41,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm kind of glad that you are
the one that caught me.</font>

1400
02:00:45,553 --> 02:00:47,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps you don't know this..</font>

1401
02:00:49,591 --> 02:00:51,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but I think of you
as my best friend.</font>

1402
02:00:55,942 --> 02:00:58,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now that might not be
a big deal to you..</font>

1403
02:01:00,154 --> 02:01:03,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but you've meant
a great deal to me.</font>

1404
02:01:07,506 --> 02:01:10,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It feels quite nice
knowing that it's all over.</font>

1405
02:01:17,688 --> 02:01:20,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody had to free me</font>

1406
02:01:20,243 --> 02:01:24,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and stop me from stealing things
that don't belong to me.</font>

1407
02:01:26,421 --> 02:01:29,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that someone
turned out to be you.</font>

1408
02:01:31,185 --> 02:01:35,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you remember the time you
took down that 8 pointer</font>

1409
02:01:35,465 --> 02:01:37,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I'd been tracking
for 4 days?</font>

1410
02:01:40,608 --> 02:01:43,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was on my territory
for sure.</font>

1411
02:01:43,645 --> 02:01:45,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one's questioning that.</font>

1412
02:01:45,889 --> 02:01:47,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've always been
a great shot.</font>

1413
02:01:49,272 --> 02:01:52,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now would you, uh,
quit pointing that gun at me?</font>

1414
02:01:54,277 --> 02:01:56,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kind of hurting my feelings
a little bit.</font>

1415
02:01:58,591 --> 02:02:00,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not going anywhere.</font>

1416
02:02:02,146 --> 02:02:04,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After all you know me, S.P.</font>

1417
02:02:09,982 --> 02:02:10,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1418
02:02:12,536 --> 02:02:13,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you.</font>

1419
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:19,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you've never lied to me.</font>

1420
02:02:20,510 --> 02:02:21,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1421
02:02:31,659 --> 02:02:34,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just as fast
as I always was, huh?</font>

1422
02:02:37,043 --> 02:02:39,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wouldn't make it
to the door.</font>

1423
02:02:45,259 --> 02:02:46,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have I done?</font>

1424
02:04:23,799 --> 02:04:25,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got him, S.P.</font>

1425
02:04:27,078 --> 02:04:29,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'll take it from here.</font>

1426
02:05:10,398 --> 02:05:11,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we agree on this?</font>

1427
02:05:13,711 --> 02:05:15,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that a full metal jacket
cartridge?</font>

1428
02:05:19,061 --> 02:05:21,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir. That is..</font>

1429
02:05:21,857 --> 02:05:24,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is a full metal jacket
rifle cartridge.</font>

1430
02:05:24,860 --> 02:05:26,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, please, please</font>

1431
02:05:26,275 --> 02:05:28,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">please, don't do this, please.</font>

1432
02:05:28,243 --> 02:05:30,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Alright, come on.
- Don't do it, please!</font>

1433
02:06:21,192 --> 02:06:22,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.</font>

1434
02:06:23,540 --> 02:06:24,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't focus.</font>

1435
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:27,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's too close.</font>

1436
02:08:32,323 --> 02:08:33,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfect.</font>

1437
02:08:40,159 --> 02:08:41,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jack!</font>

1438
02:08:49,306 --> 02:08:50,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jack!</font>

1439
02:09:11,708 --> 02:09:12,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

1440
02:09:13,675 --> 02:09:15,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call me Verge.</font>

1441
02:09:21,545 --> 02:09:23,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you get in here?</font>

1442
02:09:26,446 --> 02:09:27,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want?</font>

1443
02:09:28,725 --> 02:09:31,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As I see it,
it's you who called me.</font>

1444
02:09:39,839 --> 02:09:43,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been with you for a while,
you just didn't notice me.</font>

1445
02:09:59,997 --> 02:10:03,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, did you come here
to stop me?</font>

1446
02:10:05,693 --> 02:10:08,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't come here to stop you
from anything.</font>

1447
02:10:08,385 --> 02:10:10,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just have one question.</font>

1448
02:10:13,562 --> 02:10:16,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the question?</font>

1449
02:10:16,151 --> 02:10:19,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wasn't there something about
you building a house?</font>

1450
02:10:22,019 --> 02:10:24,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wasn't Jack going to
build a house?</font>

1451
02:10:33,582 --> 02:10:34,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1452
02:10:37,034 --> 02:10:40,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I... I was..</font>

1453
02:10:44,801 --> 02:10:46,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...trying..</font>

1454
02:10:47,217 --> 02:10:49,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but I didn't get very far.</font>

1455
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:06,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the police.</font>

1456
02:11:06,581 --> 02:11:09,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come out with your hands
where we can see them</font>

1457
02:11:14,934 --> 02:11:17,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see it's going to be
a bit difficult</font>

1458
02:11:17,661 --> 02:11:20,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to get that house built,
but perhaps another one.</font>

1459
02:11:24,219 --> 02:11:27,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think, Jack, after all
you are an engineer</font>

1460
02:11:27,153 --> 02:11:29,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and call yourself an architect.</font>

1461
02:11:36,162 --> 02:11:38,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been told you have an
interesting theory</font>

1462
02:11:38,544 --> 02:11:41,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about the material</font>

1463
02:11:41,823 --> 02:11:45,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which you claim
has its own will.</font>

1464
02:11:45,240 --> 02:11:48,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find the material, Jack</font>

1465
02:11:48,243 --> 02:11:50,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and let it do the work.</font>

1466
02:12:43,574 --> 02:12:45,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your house is a fine little
house, Jack.</font>

1467
02:12:49,270 --> 02:12:51,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's absolutely usable.</font>

1468
02:13:09,255 --> 02:13:10,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you coming, Jack?</font>

1469
02:13:58,995 --> 02:14:02,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here... Jack.</font>

1470
02:14:11,007 --> 02:14:13,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May I ask you something?</font>

1471
02:14:13,216 --> 02:14:15,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't promise I'll answer.</font>

1472
02:14:16,944 --> 02:14:19,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">R... right,
that is exactly what I meant.</font>

1473
02:14:21,051 --> 02:14:23,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, are you allowed to speak
along the way?</font>

1474
02:14:25,124 --> 02:14:27,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was thinking
there might be rules.</font>

1475
02:14:28,541 --> 02:14:29,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put it this way</font>

1476
02:14:30,026 --> 02:14:33,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">very few make it all the way
without uttering a word.</font>

1477
02:14:33,891 --> 02:14:36,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People are overcome
with a strange</font>

1478
02:14:36,135 --> 02:14:39,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and sudden need
to confess on these trips.</font>

1479
02:14:39,518 --> 02:14:41,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And not all of it can be said</font>

1480
02:14:41,416 --> 02:14:45,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be of great
rhetorical quality</font>

1481
02:14:45,041 --> 02:14:46,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but do carry on merrily</font>

1482
02:14:46,904 --> 02:14:49,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just don't believe you're
going to tell me something</font>

1483
02:14:49,631 --> 02:14:51,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't heard before.</font>

1484
02:16:29,835 --> 02:16:31,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you hear a buzzing sound?</font>

1485
02:16:31,664 --> 02:16:32,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1486
02:16:33,804 --> 02:16:35,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I don't think
you want to know</font>

1487
02:16:35,875 --> 02:16:37,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where it's coming from.</font>

1488
02:16:41,502 --> 02:16:43,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna know everything.</font>

1489
02:16:44,815 --> 02:16:47,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For thousands of years
human beings</font>

1490
02:16:47,197 --> 02:16:50,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have tried to localize hell.</font>

1491
02:16:50,097 --> 02:16:51,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Among other methods</font>

1492
02:16:51,477 --> 02:16:55,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by seeking the sound
it generates.</font>

1493
02:16:55,343 --> 02:16:59,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One shouldn't focus on
extracting screams and wailing</font>

1494
02:17:00,003 --> 02:17:03,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because the cries of pain
of so many millions</font>

1495
02:17:03,213 --> 02:17:05,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of individuals together..</font>

1496
02:17:07,666 --> 02:17:10,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...becomes what you have
just heard.</font>

1497
02:17:10,151 --> 02:17:13,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A buzzing sound whose intensity</font>

1498
02:17:13,050 --> 02:17:15,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will increase
as we get ever closer</font>

1499
02:17:15,812 --> 02:17:18,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the presence of suffering.</font>

1500
02:18:49,975 --> 02:18:51,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Verge?</font>

1501
02:18:51,390 --> 02:18:53,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here, Jack.</font>

1502
02:19:03,782 --> 02:19:05,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't feel so good, Verge.</font>

1503
02:19:09,857 --> 02:19:11,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a sour taste
in my mouth.</font>

1504
02:19:13,170 --> 02:19:16,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want me to show you the way
to the next whiskey bar?</font>

1505
02:20:56,826 --> 02:20:59,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those are the Elysian Fields.</font>

1506
02:21:02,901 --> 02:21:04,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't have access here.</font>

1507
02:23:07,163 --> 02:23:10,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how deep
the deepest hell goes.</font>

1508
02:23:17,967 --> 02:23:21,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's actually not here
I'm to deliver you..</font>

1509
02:23:22,799 --> 02:23:25,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...however improbable
that may sound..</font>

1510
02:23:26,389 --> 02:23:28,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but a couple of circles
higher up.</font>

1511
02:23:36,261 --> 02:23:39,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took you down here
as a kind of a favor..</font>

1512
02:23:40,541 --> 02:23:44,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...because you did after all
give me a little to chew on</font>

1513
02:23:44,683 --> 02:23:46,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with your story,
and I understood</font>

1514
02:23:47,030 --> 02:23:49,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you wanted to see it all.</font>

1515
02:24:05,290 --> 02:24:09,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you are done looking,
we'll turn back.</font>

1516
02:24:13,954 --> 02:24:15,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where does that path lead?</font>

1517
02:24:16,853 --> 02:24:18,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the other side.</font>

1518
02:24:20,650 --> 02:24:25,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It leads out of hell and up.</font>

1519
02:24:27,795 --> 02:24:31,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you can see
there was once a bridge</font>

1520
02:24:31,316 --> 02:24:33,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that was before my time.</font>

1521
02:24:42,189 --> 02:24:45,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't it possible
to climb all the way around?</font>

1522
02:24:49,576 --> 02:24:50,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way..</font>

1523
02:24:52,268 --> 02:24:54,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and make it over
to the other side?</font>

1524
02:24:56,652 --> 02:25:00,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quite a few have tried,
but I have to say..</font>

1525
02:25:01,380 --> 02:25:03,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...never successfully.</font>

1526
02:25:13,807 --> 02:25:16,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't recommend it</font>

1527
02:25:16,637 --> 02:25:20,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the choice
is entirely yours.</font>

1528
02:25:29,063 --> 02:25:30,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take my chance.</font>

1529
02:25:47,426 --> 02:25:48,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye, Jack.</font>

1530
02:25:50,015 --> 02:25:51,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye, Verge.</font>
