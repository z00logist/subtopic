No preaching or swaying of opinion.</i></b>

6
00:00:56,423 --> 00:01:03,090
<b><i>Just a cozy time. So why not
poke fun at artsy-fartsy culture?</i></b>

7
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:09,466

<b><i>who, by miraculous chance, got a job.
A very special job.</i></b>

9
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,244
Hello. So we finally meet.
I'm the company president.

10
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:26,616
I'm the company president.

11
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:30,953
I've given Mr. Ravn power of attorney
to conclude the deal.

12
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:34,085
Hello again... "Optional."

13
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:38,788
- Kristoffer? Butterflies?
-No.

14
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:44,532
Let's get this done.
It's our non-disclosure agreement.

15
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:49,439
You said
you'd never written for the stage?

16
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:55,449
May I ask why?
This text is succinct and intense.

17
00:01:55,515 --> 00:02:00,476
- But it says far more than it says.
- Really?

18
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:04,513
I had hoped it would say
as little as possible.

19
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:09,656
The sanctions might seem drastic,
but that's law for you.

20
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:14,030
The main thing
is that you keep this a secret.

21
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,468
- Secret?
- But you're used to that.

22
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:23,966
You don't shoot someone on stage
and tell the crowd: "I'm only acting."

23
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:26,342
I don't know.

24
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:33,478
That particular statement applies to
many of Gambini's anti-characters.

25
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:38,218
- I'm your man, Ravn.
- Great. You're playing the boss.

26
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,056
I'm in a bit of a pinch

27
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,860
because the real boss is...
not accessible.

28
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:50,198
We must act now.
The Icelanders are so damn pushy.

29
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,069
It won't take too long,

30
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:58,111
so you'll be making quite a bundle,

31
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:02,171
seeing as you're not working.
Sign here.

32
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:07,278
I don't keep busy
just to be busy.

33
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:12,917
- It's not illegal or anything!
- Legal or illegal, I don't care.

34
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:18,761
I'm an actor. The character is my law.
And the script is my court.

35
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,631
Court?
Let's pray it never gets that far.

36
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:29,574
Excellent...
Your money.

37
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:35,038
- What's that on your forehead?
- Soot.

38
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:40,212
I always rely on Gambini.
You can't go wrong.

39
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,982
<b><i>The Hanged Cat?</i></b>

40
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:46,617
The chimney sweep's monologue
from <b><i>A Town without Chimneys.</i></b>

41
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,788
- You know it?
-1 only know <b><i>Top Cat.</i></b>

42
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:57,303
"I have traveled far,
and with reluctance, to this town."

43
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,669
Our president doesn't have soot
on his forehead.

44
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:06,110
The things a character doesn't have
define him more than what he has.

45
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:12,949
Theater begins to unfold itself
at the point where it ends.

46
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,419
Don't make me nervous, Kristoffer.

47
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:22,462
Let's keep it simple.

48
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:28,328
I'll just endow my character
with a small tribute to Gambini.

49
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:32,997
Fine! It won't make any difference.
You're only the boss for a moment.

50
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:38,203
Then there's the pauses...
So vital to our understanding.

51
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:43,113
He could actually
not say anything at all.

52
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,944
You have to say what's on the page.

53
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:52,515
Otherwise, what's the point?
Just what's on the page.

54
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:56,153
Hello. So we finally meet.
I'm the company president.

55
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:01,862
I finally tracked him down.

56
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:07,031

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,519
Dear Mr. President -

70
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:30,785
and I'm referring to
our own little president -

71
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:35,089
We're happy just
to have a president.

72
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:40,661
I want to say the following...

73
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:46,467
Our president has requested
to be kept out of the negotiations.

74
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,269
Did I get that right?

75
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:52,778
The price is our top priority.

76
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:56,748
And we've already agreed on it.

77
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,749
I have...

78
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,088
turned over...

79
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:15,930

81
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,377

82
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,940
Ravn.

83
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:39,122
I'm sorry...
I didn't quite get that.

84
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,957
The pauses confused me.

85
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:46,796
Would you mind
repeating it a bit quicker?

86
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,534
I have turned over
power of attorney to Mr. Ravn.

<b><i>(man translates)</i></b>

call ours "the Danish president"?

Icelandic or Danish... Same thing!

93
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:23,231
- 400 jolly years under Icelandic rule.
- It was the other way round.

94
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,734
It sure as hell
didn't feel that way to us.

95
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,240
No.

96
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,544
Well, I better get back to the States.

97
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:45,348

doesn't make it less fun.

Hello. So we finally meet.
I'm the company president.

110
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,803
Shit! They weren't
supposed to see you.

111
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:18,180
- Word will spread like wildfire.
- They could tell I wasn't for real.

112
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:23,450
- They had no time to tell Finnur...
- That's not the problem.

113
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:28,290
They looked shocked because they
thought you were the real president.

114
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,392
Well, I did play him well.

115
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:36,435
Although you didn't give me
much to work with.

116
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,471
If the performance is topnotch

117
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:43,305
physical resemblance
has less significance.

118
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:48,644
The physical resemblance with their
president often years is irrelevant.

119
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:55,177
They've never seen him.

120
00:10:56,456 --> 00:11:00,188
- Never seen him?
-No.

121
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:04,696
-1 don't quite get it.
- If I wasn't such a wuss.

122
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:09,566
Companies need presidents.
I didn't have it in me.

123
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,663
I couldn't see myself as one.

124
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:19,838
So when I started the company
I told them I was an employee.

125
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:24,577
That the president was tending to
his companies and lived in the States.

126
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:31,090
I know it's strange and suspicious.
A boss that I invented, Kristoffer.

127
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,457
It was fine as long as
no one wanted to talk to him.

128
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:41,626
Then that fucking Icelander came along.
They don't trust anyone.

129
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:46,864
Strange...
They called Gambini strange too.

130
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:52,037
Look...
I told you I was your man.

131
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:56,879
I am... And not just any man.
I'm an actor.

132
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,478
That's exactly what you need
to make your world work.

133
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:10,228
- It's only a week. I'll write a contract.
- No need.

134
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,162
It's a hobby of mine.

135
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:18,568
This deal is vital to the company.
The slightest doubt...

136
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:24,076
I have considerable training in sensing
doubt in the minds of my audience.

137
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:31,243
- You'll have to meet the staff.
- Being seen is part of the job.

138
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:38,024
- If you talk, I'll slaughter you!
- Stop fussing.

139
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:47,266
Heidi A.? Would you get
the six seniors together?

140
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:51,133
I want you to meet someone special.

141
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:54,299
They're the six I started out with.

142
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:07,584
Here at last...
The boss of it all.

143
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:18,058
He took a week out of his schedule
to be with us in Denmark.

144
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:23,398
Probably because deep down inside
he's... Danish.

145
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:29,138
And perhaps
he feels he has...

146
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:34,545
maybe not <b><i>abandoned,
</i></b>but <b><i>neglected </i></b>our little branch.

147
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,880
Yes, that's understandable.

148
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:43,516
That's understandable.

149
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:46,558
Yes, that <b><i>is </i></b>understandable.

150
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,357
So there's lots for you to talk about.

151
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:59,336
I guess I'll stick my tail
between my legs, as they say...

152
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,432
and scoot on back to my office.

153
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,683
Any questions?

154
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:22,023
What's your name?

155
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:25,292
- My name?
-Yes.

156
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:30,927
No one's ever called you
anything but "the boss of it all."

157
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:36,771
Some of the girls had the honor of
getting emails with specific details.

158
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:42,406
Let me make it clear
that it's been at random,

159
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:46,816
who I needed to write
directly to over the years.

160
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,889
There's no personal preference there.

161
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:54,518
Holy smoke...
One does have to be careful.

162
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:58,997
- His name is Svend.
- Svend E.

163
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:03,900
That's what my emails said.
What does the E stand for?

164
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:09,439
Didn't I write that?
Ravn didn't say?

165
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:13,240
For ten years? Never, ever?!

166
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:19,252
That's good news.
Because that means...

167
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:23,949
I can tell you that
I have a name I'm very partial to...

168
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:27,788
and proud of.

169
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:30,863
Ecker...

170
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:36,300
Eckersberg...
Svend Eckersberg.

171
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:44,009
- And what should I call you?
- Gorm wants to call you Svend.

172
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,842
Gorm may call me
whatever he likes.

173
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:52,509
Gorm may even call me Kristoffer,
if he likes.

174
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:56,111
Why should he call you Kristoffer?

175
00:15:56,189 --> 00:16:00,626
No, why on earth should he?
Why in the world should he?

176
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:04,562
- By all means, call me Svend.
- OK, Svend.

177
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,861
I'd like to say one thing.

178
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:12,233
- Autumn in the country is muggy.
- Gorm, don't.

179
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,774
Real muggy!
I want you to know that.

180
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:21,542
People generally think
autumn has a freshness to it.

181
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,151
No, Gorm!

182
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:33,589
- Are you done now? Huh?!
- Everything's cool.

183
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:37,254
- Are you done?
- Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

184
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,924
Everything is perfectly fine.

185
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,768
Stop it!

186
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,111
Boy, that's nasty.

187
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:59,182
I'm afraid you'll have to apologize.

188
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:02,551
Should I apologize to him?!

189
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:08,587
Don't forget
the tech conference tomorrow.

190
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,390
Tech conference...

191
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:21,870
Ravn...
They're all completely insane.

192
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:26,538
- We need to talk.
- On neutral ground! I'll call you.

193
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,449
OK.

194
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:40,521
If my character's name is Svend,
for example,

195
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:43,221
then I'd like to know.

196
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:47,289
-1 just want to be in the loop.
- Sure.

197
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,426
The names didn't really matter.

198
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:55,737
Gorm is a country boy. He sometimes
suffers from rural depression.

199
00:17:56,442 --> 00:18:01,312
- But he's a wizard with Brooker 5.
- What the hell is that?

200
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,942
Our flagship, our biggest seller.
That's what we started out with.

201
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:13,591
My character doesn't like
when they cry, shout or hit.

202
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:18,597
My personal space has been violated.

203
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:23,534
I must insist on control.
They must be subdued.

204
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:27,664
The six seniors
can be a bit of a hassle.

205
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,766
They're the creative bunch
in the firm.

206
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:36,111
I don't know about the psychology
of actors, but I imagine it's similar.

207
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:41,142
So things are that bad?

208
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:45,748
I love them dearly. Although they have
knocked me around a bit.

209
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:49,090
It can't be as bad
as Slagelse in 1992.

210
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:53,963
Though I did talk the women
ticket holders down after the show.

211
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:59,631
I didn't know Slagelse had a theater.
And they didn't, artistically speaking.

212
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:10,682
- What's wrong? What was that?
- My mournful and remote look.

213
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,949
- It must terrify people.
- Yes, it's effective.

214
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:20,550
The six seniors
were more feisty than I'd expected.

215
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,493
This tech conference
sounds ominous.

216
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:29,194
Tell me about what you do,
so I can learn the lingo.

217
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,033
IT.

218
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:36,906
That's impossible to grasp!
I don't stand a chance.

219
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:43,248
Good thing
you're such a good actor.

220
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:48,753
You're prepared now.
Subdue them, take control.

221
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,050
All right?

222
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,367
<b><i>(photocopier starts up)</i></b>

223
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,467
Wow...

224
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:13,141
It's quite a shocker
when the copy machine starts.

225
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:19,608
Luckily it's not that often.
Only a thousand times a day.

226
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:33,922
How's the weather
out in the country today?

227
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:38,897
Well, let's just assume

228
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:44,307
that it's wintry like it is
throughout the country.

229
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,409
Looking for your office?

230
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:58,115
I figured the office would be
a safer bet than the corridors.

231
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:02,058
Safer?
What do you mean?

232
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:06,622
So people can find me.
Since I'm here rather seldom.

233
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:11,694
So you want to see them?
I told them to wait. I'll pass it on.

234
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:16,708
- Thanks.
- Jokumsen is waiting outside.

235
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,835
I don't know how he found out
you were here.

236
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,973
It's the deficiency list
for the DB7 patch.

237
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:29,078
I doubt if he's lightened up
since he last complained.

238
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:32,648
Should we push Jokumsen
till after the tech conference?

239
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:46,530
Sorry. He's acted as our boss
when the boss wasn't here.

240
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,802
We start off
with the management's visions.

241
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:54,040
I'd like to hear more
about the visions.

242
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:58,174
I studied the old
corporate philosophy.

243
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:06,157
And, as such, certain technical and
strategic measures seem most unclear.

244
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:19,999
Transaction hierarchy... Why not?
The 80:20 rule. Agile development.

245
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:23,941
That's just a minor part
of the terms necessary

246
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:27,274
to define IT
at an acceptable level.

247
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,871
Aside from those fucking terms,

248
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:34,386
what's the boss' definition
of transaction hierarchy?

249
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:40,358
And the 80:20 rule?
Maybe I dozed off, but what is it?

250
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:45,955
"Agile development" is defined
in seven or eight different ways.

251
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:48,761
How would you define it?

252
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:03,805
<b><i>(clears throat)</i></b>

253
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:08,877
Define...
"Dictate," I'm tempted to say.

254
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,585
There is a very fine line
between defining and dictating.

255
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:19,825
And it all boils down to
whether the boss wants to dictate.

256
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:25,393
Or rather whether the boss has
any idea what we do in this company.

257
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:30,670
Or whether you have any idea
what we do at this company.

258
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:35,077
-1 should certainly say so.
- What, then?

259
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:39,175
- What?
- What we do?

260
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:42,652
Didn't you prepare a presentation?
What do we do?

261
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:48,057
- This and that. In general?
- Yes, for example.

262
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:51,256
Uhh...

263
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,957
Uh...

264
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:59,301
Hi, everyone.
I just have a practical announcement.

265
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:04,207
Oh, Nalle... Such a pouty face.
Come on.

266
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:10,776
Upsy-daisy...
and a big hug.

267
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:15,686
What was the practical nature
of your announcement, Ravn?

268
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,347
<b><i>(Ravn clears throat)</i></b>

269
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:23,318
The trip to Kullen is off.

270
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:30,658
But we were going
because we didn't go last year.

271
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:36,800
<b><i>(broken Danish)
</i></b>Can anybody tell me... what... that...?

272
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:42,139
- Keep quiet, Spencer.
- Work on it.

273
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:45,741
I am afraid
the decision came from above.

274
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:51,881
I know it reflects
a hard policy about perks.

275
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,516
I'm sure there's
a perfectly good reason.

276
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:59,929
The reason we're not going is
because the boss of it all says so.

277
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:05,262
"Because the boss of it all says so."
That's a fucking old line.

278
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:10,104
Why don't the six of us just take
our rights to Brooker 5 and leave?

279
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:14,942
- Be nice, Gorm.
- But you're not nice to us.

280
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:20,508
We all agree we'd be far better off
without the fucking boss of it all.

281
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:25,387
Let's not dampen the good mood.
It's my fault. And this conference

282
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:30,418
is not for debating whether
the boss is a hard-ass or not.

283
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,931
Let's hear what Svend has to say.

284
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:40,531
- Svend?
- Come on, Svend!

285
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:59,884
We usually get the sales figures,
though not at the tech conference.

286
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:03,554
Maybe you can give us an idea,
if you've seen them.

287
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:09,295
- Of course I have seen them.
<b><i>- (Gorm) </i></b>So how do they look?

288
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:15,900
They're shit.

289
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:25,640
Now it's finally out.
They're shit.

290
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,810
They're piss.

291
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,252
They're pig swill.

292
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,656
We need to turn this ship round!

293
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,489
Those figures had better
look completely different.

294
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:41,032
- Now it's out in the open.
- There, Mette.

295
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:44,364
<b><i>(Gorm) </i></b>But the figures look fine
in your mails.

296
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,030
Did Mette say they were fine?

297
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:51,269
All I can say, Mette,

298
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:54,176
is that they aren't good enough.

299
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,977
Far, far from it, Mette.

300
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:06,950
- Now poor Mette is crying again.
- There, Mette.

301
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:10,018
They're just numbers.

302
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,356
<b><i>(knock at door)</i></b>

303
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:22,865
They are lined up outside. You want
to see Lise and Spencer, or Jokumsen?

304
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:27,776
Anyone but Jokumsen.
His complaint seems legitimate.

305
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:35,611
- Lise is our HR representative.
- Sure, why not?

306
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:41,285
- Spencer has something to say.
<b><i>- (broken Danish) </i></b>We will work longer...

307
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,387
- No longer.

00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:52,028
We will no longer
accept thighs...

309
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:54,402
- These.
- ...working conditions.

310
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:58,636
It's easier for me to say it
when you can't say it properly.

311
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,077
He means "working conditions."

312
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:05,549
Our working conditions are dreadful.
So is the personnel policy.

313
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:11,488
Other companies have perks.
Here's a list.

314
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:15,653
Would you mind leaving, Heidi?

315
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,458
All the way out.

316
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:24,196
So you are affiliated
with certain biker circles.

317
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:27,762
I would be naive to think

318
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:31,468
their racket is limited
to small shopkeepers.

319
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:35,104
With the Hell's Angels
up your sleeve,

320
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:41,483
your demands require a different approach.
But keep quiet about it.

321
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:50,622
HR. HR.

322
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:54,894
Human Resources.
You've been in the States so long,

323
00:28:54,967 --> 00:29:00,462
you can't remember what it means.
I'll look it up for you in English.

324
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,632
You can tell me.

325
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:08,477
You can fess up.

326
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:14,542
I discussed it with the others.
We think you have a credibility problem.

327
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:21,924
Your personality gives you away.

328
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:24,793
You're not who you pretend to be.

329
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,025
I think you should come clean.

330
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:37,940
You think that's a wise thing
to do at this point?

331
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,104
- You think so?
-Yes.

332
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:46,141
It wouldn't change much.
You're so transparent.

333
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:49,517
All your lines really lack cred.

334
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:53,148
It's lousy acting
from start to finish.

335
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:58,692
My lines lack cred?

336
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:05,133
You are too much!
Let's not forget "lousy acting."

337
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:08,537
That's when audiences
are shook up.

338
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,406
Don't they get that
the point of comedy nowadays

339
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:15,640
is to reveal the comedy?

340
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:19,844
Disaster has already struck.
It's all in the aftermath.

341
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:25,823
People just want things to be credible
and natural. Give me a fucking break!

342
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:28,690
- You have a credibility problem.
- No, I don't.

343
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:31,058
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

344
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:37,833
I don't know much about you,
but I know what you aren't.

345
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:43,735
Then tell me what I'm not,
for fuck's sake!

346
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,901
Gay.

347
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:50,006
- Gay?
- Yes, gay.

348
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:55,683
It's not so much that you try
to make me think you're gay,

349
00:30:55,754 --> 00:31:01,420
but you also pretend to be oblivious
to IT, management,

350
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:05,691
and even Human Resources.
Hell's Angels. Honestly!

351
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:10,531
Of course you're an expert, otherwise
you would never have made it this big.

352
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,900
- Am I right?
-Yeah.

353
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:18,141
Why would you think I was gay?

354
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:23,141
All those emails you sent me,
distancing yourself from me.

355
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:28,209
- And you got Ravn to plant the idea.
- What pleasure would I get from that?

356
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:34,282
The same you get from looking like
a complete jackass, professionally.

357
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:38,625
To seem interesting
or make us feel sorry for you.

358
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:42,599
You hit home with that one.

359
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:50,074
The thing about pretending
to be completely oblivious to IT,

360
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:54,272
it was a bit naive, I admit.

361
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:58,783
- But I am gay.
- You don't seem gay at all.

362
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:04,254
That's how some of us are.
And it's not to win you over.

363
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:07,656
Sorry about that.

364
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,025
I've been a cornholer since birth.

365
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,655
There is no explanation for it.

366
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,599
But rather a poop pusher
than a dry old stick.

367
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:24,940
I can explain
why you've always gone for men.

368
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:31,278
You haven't met
the right woman yet.

369
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,321
On neutral ground, ASAP.

370
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:55,696
I'm exhausted, fumbling in the dark.
No control whatsoever.

371
00:32:55,807 --> 00:33:00,472
It would be easier if I knew
what I had said or written in my past.

372
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:04,914
I mean, gay!
You could have told me.

373
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:09,319
- Dammit, Ravn!
- You're right.

374
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,220
But only Lise's president is gay.

375
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:16,027
You told them different things?!

376
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:22,367
I hear you.

377
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:26,735
- You told them different things?
-1 understand the question.

378
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:30,004
Are you a complete idiot?

379
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,740
It created a good vibe.

380
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:44,084
Everyone felt he belonged to them.
And in that sense, he did.

381
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:50,719
- And that IT shit? I don't get it.
- Me neither.

382
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:54,561
- You're doing great.
- You think?

383
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:57,534
Stick it out a couple of more days.

384
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:02,438
Take my advice, Kristoffer.
Don't take it so seriously.

385
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:08,445
All that stuff about controlling
and subduing is probably fine,

386
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,447
but it's easier not to.

387
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:14,007
Make the audience do the work.

388
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,554
Then you won't feel so stressed out.

389
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:20,387
Just say yes.
When they come to you - "Yes."

390
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:23,792
Maybe not so artistic,
but it works.

391
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:28,890
Say yes!
But that's improvisational theater.

392
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:36,169
Like when some jackass gets it
into his head he should put on a dress,

393
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:41,974
and we all have to applaud it.
Gambini didn't believe in it.

394
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:47,280
To him, improvisation was just
kowtowing to the parlor drama.

395
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:52,585
Gambini was one of the first
to see through Ibsen. Ibsen was a moron!

396
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:56,423
Too prim to grab disaster
by the throat.

397
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:00,130
Why not go straight to soap?

398
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:03,657
With all its sentimentality
and fucking cliches.

399
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:08,536
"This is not <b><i>adieu, </i></b>but <b><i>au revoiii"
</i></b>Or shit like that. It's bull.

400
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,338
- It's bull. Bull.
- Sure.

401
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,877
Calm down.

402
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:23,478
I'm sorry. You know best.
It's your character and idea.

403
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:27,287
And the idea is God.
Even Hitler's.

404
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,353
If you want improvisation
and group theater, I'll give it to you.

405
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:36,298
I'll say yes,
until you choke on it.

406
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:42,504
But not to Jokumsen. He has had
a legitimate complaint for six years.

407
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:47,205
- Why didn't he come six years ago?
-He did.

408
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:51,442
But the boss of it all
wasn't in that day.

409
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:57,520
- Oh, I see.
- And about those IT terms?

410
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:02,150
When they say "outsourcing,"
they mean "offshoring."

411
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:04,593
Piece of cake.

412
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:16,500
The cLib module performance issues
are more extensive than we thought.

413
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:19,669
Bottlenecks throughout the system.

414
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:23,544
We should put
far more validations client-side.

415
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:28,985
Outsourcing is very tempting,
but as the cLib module...

416
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:31,113
Excuse me.

417
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,182
You mean offshoring.

418
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:42,890
You said outsourcing,
but you mean offshoring.

419
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:46,730
Of course.
Thank you, Svend.

420
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:56,241
What does the boss of it all say?
Do Nalle and Mette get a green light?

421
00:36:56,314 --> 00:37:01,252
- You mean yes or no?
-1 think I can answer that.

422
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:05,153
We all can.
"A third cheaper and we go ahead."

423
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:10,686
- Is Nalle right in his assumption?
-Yes.

424
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,790
The boss of it all has spoken.

425
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,995
You just had
to take Nalle down a peg.

426
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:26,169
Rap his knuckles with everyone watching.
You're a real bastard.

427
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,507
Yes.

428
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:36,450
Upsy-daisy.
And a big hug.

429
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:42,255
Cute, right? Like a little baby.
No, wait, babies mean procreation,

430
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:46,263
and that entails screwing
members of the opposite sex.

431
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:50,533
<b><i>(photocopier starts up)</i></b>

432
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:59,270
If you have any questions
or requests of me,

433
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,803
then the answer might be yes.

434
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:08,585
Is there anything I can say?
Or that anyone can say?

435
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:13,086
They might say yes.

436
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,261
Or yes, yes, yes.

437
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:28,533
- I've had it, Svend. You read me?
-Yes.

438
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,303
You better!
All your gay crap.

439
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:36,905
-1 know when a man lusts after me.
<b><i>- (clears throat) </i></b>Yes.

440
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:40,974
- You're such a tease.
-Yes.

441
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:48,159
All those emails. "Be nice to Ravn, Lise.
Take care of Ravn."

442
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:51,560
- They were meant to get me going.
-Yes.

443
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:57,500
That faggy farce is all very well,
but there are better fish to fry.

444
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:01,334
- Fine by me.
-Yes.

445
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:06,408
- As long as you're in control, right?
-Yes.

446
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,873
Right here, right now.
The sooner the better.

447
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,080
- You male chauvinist pig.
-Yes.

448
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:25,087
There will be no fucking
till you get a proper blow-job.

449
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,871
And now, over the desk I go.
That's just the way it is.

450
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,243
-Yes.
- Right?

451
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:48,242
You like it best
when I have no say in the matter.

452
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:02,967
Don't let it confuse you,
but I have two holes.

453
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:05,895
-Yes.
- Right.

454
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:14,710
So that's why
they call you the boss of it all.

455
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,385
- You are a bastard.
-Yes.

456
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:25,045
-Yes.
- Yes, yes, yes.

457
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:27,819
Is that all you can say?!

458
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:36,167
- Are you familiar with Gambini?
-Who?

459
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,105
You look tired.

460
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:54,483
I told Jokumsen
he couldn't see you today.

461
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:58,682
I told him to try again next week.
Hope that's all right.

462
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:04,092
- That's fine, 'cause I won't be here.
- Are you leaving again?

463
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:10,961
By the way, thanks for all your greetings
from round the world.

464
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,968
They meant a lot to me.

465
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,535
And I've replied to all of them.

466
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,971
Apart from one.

467
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,677
Yes.

468
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,843
Yes, that's right.

469
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,955
There was one
you didn't reply to.

470
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,857
Why didn't you?

471
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:39,828
-You want to talk about it now?
- I'm here now.

472
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,991
That's true.

473
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:45,668
<b><i>(stutters)</i></b>

474
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:49,867
You're always making jokes
about everything.

475
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:57,006
Sometimes it confuses me.
I can't tell if you are joking.

476
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:00,051
Why would you think it was a joke?

477
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:04,347
It could hardly be anything else.

478
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:10,190
If it hadn't been a joke,
what would you have said?

479
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:16,727
I think you know.

480
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:20,294
No. That's why I am asking.

481
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:22,635
- If it wasn't a joke...
-Yes.

482
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,435
...I would have said yes.

483
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:32,212
That's nuts, seeing as
we hardly know each other.

484
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,625
You don't seem thrilled
about my yes.

485
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:48,727
Sorry. How stupid of me.

486
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,092
This is embarrassing.

487
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:55,769
That's why I didn't reply.

488
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:59,607
Of course it was a joke.

489
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:03,444
Yes, and it's funny.

490
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:06,814
I'm so stupid,
I thought you meant it.

491
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,409
Sorry. I'm going all red.

492
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,920

493
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,290
it's great that
you would have said yes.

494
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:26,002
Not everyone would.
I respect you for it.

495
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:32,270
My goodness. Great.
Can we just forget about it?

496
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:37,713
I can't believe I was so ambiguous
that you were in doubt.

497
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:41,780
It's not like me.
It's not in character.

498
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:46,449
Sometimes we ask questions in jest
that we'd like an answer to,

499
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:48,925
in case we ever ask for real.

500
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:54,390
I just thought
there were real feelings there.

501
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:56,558
Come on!

502
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:02,329
You think
I'd cover my bets like that?

503
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:06,036
And fish for an answer
out of fear?

504
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:10,843
Does that sound
like the boss of it all?

505
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:15,511
A man is a man, a word is a word,
and a boss is a goddamn boss.

506
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:19,420
I didn't build an empire
by farting around like that.

507
00:44:19,524 --> 00:44:22,721
Heidi A.
I remember that mail clearly.

508
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:27,560
If you ask me whether I meant it,
the answer is yes.

509
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,896
And the question still stands.

510
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,731
- Damn right!
-Oh.

511
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,430
"Oh" is right.

512
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:38,236
- I'm so happy.
- If you're happy, I'm happy.

513
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,835
It wasn't just
to keep me from quitting?

514
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:46,873
Of course not.
What does that have to do with it?

515
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:51,252
And I didn't quit.
I stayed with you.

516
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:57,385
-You did.
- Mainly because of your email.

517
00:44:58,563 --> 00:45:05,025
Yes, and I think it's time to knock off,
even for the boss.

518
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:11,602
I'm glad we got that little matter
sorted to our mutual satisfaction.

519
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:18,715
You look like something
is bugging you again.

520
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:27,148
- Everything will be fine.
- I'm just so happy you meant it.

521
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:31,627
Especially considering
how little you know about me.

522
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:35,791
Isn't there anything
you'd like to ask me?

523
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,926
Of course there is, Heidi A.

524
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:45,432
What does the A stand for?
Not that it matters.

525
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:49,275
No, because now
it'll be Heidi E.

526
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,740
Heidi Eckersberg.

527
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,648
All right, then.

528
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:11,825
<b><i>(man) Oh, no! Just as things
were working out Why this break?</i></b>

529
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:15,929
<b><i>Not to mention this primitive,
pointless ZOOM?</i></b>

530
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:19,738
<b><i>/ declare,
no comedy without breaks.</i></b>

531
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,611
<b><i>Vitamins must be injected,

532
00:46:23,681 --> 00:46:26,707
<b><i>And who likes being

533
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:32,085
<b><i>interrupting a child's play?

534
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:38,186
<b><i>And I hereby feel obliged
to introduce a new character.</i></b>

535
00:46:48,673 --> 00:46:51,198
The boss is horny as hell.

536
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:55,575
There's probably
still a slight trace

537
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,310
of homophilia in his dong.

538
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:03,149
The boss will be right with you.

539
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:09,251
How was the cred
in that line, toots?

540
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,726
Not bad, "toots."

541
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:17,063
- Kisser! You don't work with IT.
- The same goes for you.

542
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,396
I don't remember
you looking this happy.

543
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:25,237
But we were only married for 5 years.
Or was it 50?

544
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:33,511
Were you ever happy?
Yes, when drooling over that Gambini jerk.

545
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:37,851
A hoax nobody's ever heard of.

546
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:42,518
A hoax in seven-league boots.
With Gambini, disaster has already struck.

547
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:49,761
A one-act play, three hours long!
<b><i>The Chimney Sweep's Monologue'.</i></b>

548
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:54,930
Too much <b><i>Christmas Carol
</i></b>for my taste.

549
00:47:55,039 --> 00:48:00,534
- No wonder I couldn't stand you.
-1 couldn't stand you, either.

550
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:05,408
- Why not?
- Peanuts.

551
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:11,913
You ate them with the shells on.
They only do that in cartoons.

552
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:18,622
It drove me crazy!
I bet you're here to get something.

553
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:22,632
- Come to win me back?
-1 don't want you back.

554
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:27,500
For something else, then.
You're so damned efficient.

555
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:34,435
I bet you graduated even before
you started. And got promoted.

556
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:38,244
I'm Finnur Sigurdsson's attorney.

557
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:40,011
Wow, capitalism!

558
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:45,481
Weren't you going
to use your degree to fight it?

559
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,854
Yes, I believe I was.

560
00:48:48,993 --> 00:48:51,928
Finnur mentioned me,
but you forgot.

561
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:57,958
Life is a dogma film. It's hard to hear,
but the words are still important.

562
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:01,995
I'm here to assess the likelihood
of the president's presence tomorrow,

563
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:06,168
at the sales talks
with my client.

564
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:10,646
So far, I have my doubts.
All I know is you're not him.

565
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:14,446
Why couldn't I?
Why couldn't I be the boss of it all?

566
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:18,546
Like the chimney sweep
from <b><i>The Town without Chimneys?</i></b>

567
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:23,855
- Always with soot on his forehead.
- Maybe you were wrong.

568
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:29,357
Maybe there is more to me
than you saw back then.

569
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,526
Yes.

570
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:37,732
- But there isn't, is there?
-No.

571
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:43,738
Not according to
what they teach at law school.

572
00:49:43,848 --> 00:49:46,715
What we learnt was more tangible.

573
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:50,811
Is that really the president,
or isn't he the president?

574
00:49:50,888 --> 00:49:53,983
All right, I'm a stand-in.

575
00:49:54,058 --> 00:49:58,518
My lips are sealed.
I signed a non-disclosure agreement.

576
00:49:58,629 --> 00:50:01,530
A non-disclosure with old Ravn?

577
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:03,896
Dammit, Kristoffer!

578
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:10,774
He's really got you by the balls.
He's a whiz with contracts.

579
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:15,510
Are you going
to blow the whistle on me?

580
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:22,042
Then I'd have done it ten years ago
when you started acting... toots.

581
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:27,051
- But I see you love the part.
-1 am good at it.

582
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:32,892
Seems so. And parts for you
don't exactly grow on trees.

583
00:50:32,997 --> 00:50:36,933
And it goes against your convictions
to check things thoroughly.

584
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:43,030
- All you want is attention.
-1 keep these IT nerds in check.

585
00:50:43,107 --> 00:50:47,908
So that the rightful owner
can do business.

586
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:53,713
In law we say, "Too stupid for words."
And that's you, if you believe Ravn.

587
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:57,084
Ravn is all right.
We get along fine.

588
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:02,092
He loves his staff,
but lacks the strength to be the boss.

589
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:04,718
He's a wuss, but not malicious.

590
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:10,291
Not unless he exploits the system
to drive his staff to the utmost.

591
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:16,829
By blaming all the shit on this boss
you can appear likable and noble.

592
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:21,435
- Why do you care?
-1 don't.

593
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:27,710
But once I saw
a shred of decency in you.

594
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:32,086
You're not as bad as
you'd like to be, Kristoffer.

595
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:36,718
You almost looked like
you considered the moral aspects.

596
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:41,891
All of Ravn's dealings
benefit the company

597
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:47,370
and thereby his staff. This is a
good deal for their beloved workplace.

598
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:52,671
Possibly. And since Ravn is as noble
as you perceive him to be,

599
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:57,976
I'm sure he has told his staff
that their beloved workplace

600
00:51:58,082 --> 00:52:01,347
is the subject of tomorrow's deal.

601
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:09,687
- Is Ravn selling the company?
- Yes. Simple as that.

602
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:23,863
No, you didn't.
You didn't manipulate me.

603
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:27,774
You've been quite the gentleman.

604
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:33,841
Even when I almost quit
to work for our worst competitor.

605
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:38,220
You've laid into Ravn a few times.

606
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:42,657
He's looked a bit sad
after a phone call from you.

607
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,524
Well...

608
00:52:44,595 --> 00:52:48,725
I have to pop down...

609
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,233
to make some copies.

610
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:54,202
Does anyone else feel manipulated?

611
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:58,401
Not me, but Gorm does.

612
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:01,444
That was a serious blow.

613
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:06,244
He took it hard when you overruled
him on the Brooker platform issue.

614
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:10,252
He'd spent two years
on the other platform.

615
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:16,191
How can you even dictate things
concerning the Brooker? It's ours.

616
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:21,229
Not me, but Nalle does.
You were out of line.

617
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:24,130
You told him
he never came prepared.

618
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:28,569
Then everyone started in on him.
You knew he'd snap.

619
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,871
<b><i>(in English) </i></b>Hi. Can I ask you
a question in English?

620
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:34,911
Danish.

621
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,311
<b><i>- (in English) </i></b>Let's do it in English.
- No, Danish.

622
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:40,042
<b><i>(chuckles)</i></b>

623
00:53:40,117 --> 00:53:44,884
You took away his Danish lessons
so he couldn't gossip in the corridors.

624
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:50,951
- Couldn't he just gossip in English?
- Sure, but he didn't want to.

625
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:55,965
And me... Not apart from
making me see to Ravn.

626
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,763
But that didn't benefit you.

627
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:05,307
- What about Ravn?
- Our cuddly teddy bear?

628
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:10,074
You can't help loving him.
Although he's pathetic at times.

629
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:16,750
Maybe I shouldn't mention it,
but his personal finances are a mess.

630
00:54:18,522 --> 00:54:22,584
- How do you know?
- He said so.

631
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:28,064
Mostly at first. Then we discussed it
and decided to lend him 25,000 each.

632
00:54:28,132 --> 00:54:31,625
Not that it helped.

633
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:35,934
- Why not?
- He hasn't paid us back yet.

634
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:42,969
- And there's Poor Mette.
-Yeah.

635
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:47,347
You know what happened
after you sacked her husband?

636
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:52,821
- No, I don't think so.
- He hung himself.

637
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:57,793
With a printer cable.
He couldn't take being excluded.

638
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:03,129
He begged to let him come back. Ravn
told us about the letters he sent you.

639
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:10,466
But we had nothing for the guy.

640
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:14,409
No, that's life.

641
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:19,210
- And now she's Poor Mette.
- Where is she?

642
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:23,583
In the copy room, I guess.

643
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:26,657
- Elisabeth, is the copier working?
-Yes.

644
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:31,925
<b><i>- (woman screams)
</i></b>- There.

645
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:41,431
<b><i>(woman sobs)</i></b>

646
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:24,605
<b><i>(fairground music)</i></b>

647
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:31,416
It's pure fantasy.
There has to be some rumors.

648
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:36,585
I deserve a bit of goodwill
for starting the business.

649
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:40,062
They didn't stake the 150,000.

650
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,929
That's exactly what they did.

651
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:48,563
They all lent you money,
and you used it to start the company.

652
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:56,637
-1 know it looks a bit shady.
- It sure does!

653
00:56:56,747 --> 00:57:02,845
I'm the director, you're just the actor.
Ask your character if the pieces fit.

654
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:06,912
I did, and I'm afraid they do.

655
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:10,620

01:12:48,264 --> 01:12:50,426
Gorm! Stop it!

824
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:07,240
I didn't have the guts after all.
They've got memories like...

825
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:11,481

827
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:23,289
Yes. I lie awake at night.
I see their eyes before me.

828
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:28,838
Forgiveness, you say!
They'll never forgive me.

829
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:31,600
Poor Mette is the worst.

830
01:13:31,674 --> 01:13:35,406
Nothing I say
is good enough for that girl.

831
01:13:35,478 --> 01:13:38,106
I'm such a wuss!

832
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:43,812
They can't forgive you if you
don't confess. We had a contract.

833
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:48,755
"I promise to confess."

834
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:53,895
- Who signed?
-1 confessed to my plan.

835
01:13:53,963 --> 01:13:58,798
And told them that I forced you!
That's not a confession.

836
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:04,271
- That's not what I meant.
- Why didn't the contract say so?

837
01:14:05,508 --> 01:14:10,776
Unfortunately for you,
law is an extremely exact science.

838
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:14,339
And therefore I demand

839
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:18,944
that you honor the contracts
you have signed, and sell.

840
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:21,991
I've set up
one last meeting with Finnur.

841

You don't want
to show your face at work.

842
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,921

you're in the States

843
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:32,695

844
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:51,046
Hi. It's me. We have to meet.
On neutral ground.

845
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:03,790
Mm!

846
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:11,197
Legally, you can't touch him.
He's got you. You have to sell.

847
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:16,678
- It's a total downer.
-Yes.

848
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:20,011
But he almost confessed, right?

849
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:25,248
You have a knack
for deliberate mental cruelty.

850
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:27,618
You're right.

851
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:32,183
But I'm better at being irritating
on an intuitive level.

852
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:34,559
What's his greatest fear?

853
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:40,400
Not being loved.
That's what it's all about.

854
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:46,033
He wants to be the big, cuddly teddy,
otherwise he loses it.

-Yes.

Two more days

869
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:10,784
Autumn is
a meteorological bombshell.

870

Speaking of bombshells,
I have a confession to make.

871

But when I tell you why I really came,
you'll see you were wrong about me.

873
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:31,142
- You're a bastard.
- Quite possibly.

874
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:33,682
But maybe
not the way you think.

875
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:40,347
I've been withholding
information from you.

876
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:45,053
That makes everything much better.
Gee, thanks, we forgive you.

877
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:51,327
I haven't been acting alone.
There has been someone in the wings.

878

This person deserves
to be brought out into the light.

It's someone above me.
My superior, my boss.

Thanks for sentimentality
so nauseating

993
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:50,794
that no living creature
could possibly take it seriously.

994
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:07,816
Do you have something to say,
Mr. Ravn?

995
01:28:07,883 --> 01:28:11,819
Is there anything
we have overlooked?

996
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:15,014
<b><i>(Ravn sniffs)</i></b>

997
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:18,218
Do tell us, Mr. Ravn.

998
01:28:30,672 --> 01:28:34,666
I'm the boss of it all.

999
01:28:36,344 --> 01:28:39,212
I own the company.

1000
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:43,950
I make the decisions.

1001
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:01,798
Gorm is right.

1002
01:29:01,870 --> 01:29:05,636
He is right.
Autumn is muggy.

1003
01:29:05,707 --> 01:29:08,677
Real muggy.

1004
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:11,542
Gaggingly muggy.

1005
01:29:24,926 --> 01:29:27,452
I'm sorry.

1006
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:29,562
I'm sorry.

1007
01:29:32,767 --> 01:29:36,135
Thank you, Ravn.

1008
01:29:41,109 --> 01:29:44,409
Was it really so hard to say?

1009
01:29:47,616 --> 01:29:51,677
I always knew
you were the boss.

1010
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:56,316
You'd have to be stupid
not to see that.

1011
01:29:59,427 --> 01:30:02,625
I forgive you, Ravn.

1012
01:30:10,538 --> 01:30:13,269
Come on.

1013
01:30:13,375 --> 01:30:16,811
On your feet...
Upsy-daisy.

1014
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:18,971
All the way.

1015
01:30:27,155 --> 01:30:29,988
<b><i>(speaks Icelandic)</i></b>

1016
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:33,152

That might be tricky.

01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:46,039
How can Kristoffer sell
what's never been his?

1020
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:53,011
No, Mr. Sigurdsson,
there will be no sale.

1021
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:58,143
The company
is more strongly united than ever.

1022
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:04,024
And more so, when I've put right
a few sins of the past.

1023
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:07,857
I have some offshoring to see to.

1024
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:14,667
Outsourcing!

1025
01:31:16,671 --> 01:31:22,542
The word is outsourcing.
You said offshoring. It's outsourcing.

1026
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:27,843
What you're doing right now
is what irritates me the most.

1027
01:31:27,916 --> 01:31:30,646
You're forgetting the actor.

1028
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,687
You're right. Sorry.

1029
01:31:34,756 --> 01:31:38,351
Kristoffer deserves the credit
for making me confess.

1030
01:31:38,426 --> 01:31:43,091
- Everything's due to you.
- That's all very well.

1031
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:47,066
But that's not how it works.

1032
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:51,537
You don't just jump
from hell to happily-ever-after.

1033
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:56,567
There are certain formalities
that have to be kept.

1034
01:31:56,678 --> 01:32:00,012
You're right!

1035
01:32:00,081 --> 01:32:04,348
Let's annul these
fucking contracts right now.

1036
01:32:06,888 --> 01:32:13,885
And now you just waive
the power of attorney to sell the firm.

1037
01:32:13,962 --> 01:32:17,295
-No.
- What?

1038
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:19,697
No. No, no, no.

1039
01:32:19,768 --> 01:32:27,106
There are binding commitments
you can't annul by the stroke of a pen.

1040
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:31,543
We are no longer interested
in a deal

1041
01:32:31,613 --> 01:32:38,451
since it's clear that the man with
the pen is not the company's legal owner.

1042
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:42,251
From his reading of the sagas
my client knows

1043
01:32:42,323 --> 01:32:46,658
that he who deals with stooges
deals with nobody.

1044
01:32:54,636 --> 01:33:00,632
Our client just remembered
some new scriptures

1045
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:05,976
that indicate
a more modern interpretation.

1046
01:33:06,081 --> 01:33:09,642
More appropriately rendered:

1047
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:14,746
"He who deals with a man without
power of attorney deals with nobody."

1048
01:33:16,825 --> 01:33:20,955
As our client sees it,
the man with the pen

1049
01:33:21,029 --> 01:33:26,763
is indeed furnished with
power of attorney, and that's fine with him.

1050
01:33:30,205 --> 01:33:34,904
What's going on, Kristoffer?
It worked out like you wanted.

1051
01:33:34,976 --> 01:33:38,503
Yeah, more or less.

1052
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:44,552
- You're not thinking of signing!
- It's beyond me. I'm an actor.

1053
01:33:44,652 --> 01:33:49,613
Whether I sign or not
is up to my character.

1054
01:33:49,691 --> 01:33:52,558
I'll have to ask him.

1055
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:55,391
But your character
is to blame for all this.

1056
01:33:55,497 --> 01:33:58,125
It's probably just a formality.

1057
01:33:58,199 --> 01:34:01,692
I need space
to consult my character.

1058
01:34:01,803 --> 01:34:04,863
After all,
he is the boss of it all.

1059
01:34:08,676 --> 01:34:10,975
What's going on?

1060
01:34:11,045 --> 01:34:14,982
He's being contrary.
He's an actor.

1061
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:19,487
He couldn't stand it
when Ravn got all the attention.

1062
01:34:19,554 --> 01:34:24,389
He's just putting on a show,
now that everyone is looking at him.

1063
01:34:24,492 --> 01:34:27,155
I hope...

1064
01:34:41,576 --> 01:34:44,807
No!
Hang on a moment.

1065
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:53,454
I can't make final contact.

1066
01:34:53,555 --> 01:34:57,787
I seem to hear
the boss saying something.

1067
01:34:57,892 --> 01:35:01,852
And then it might be the opposite.

1068
01:35:01,930 --> 01:35:05,423
Silence in the back! Shh!

1069
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:10,903
You have to breathe life
into your material.

1070
01:35:11,005 --> 01:35:15,170
What are your
character's moral values?

1071
01:35:15,243 --> 01:35:17,439
It's fascinating.

1072
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:26,316
And let me be completely frank...

1073
01:35:27,622 --> 01:35:30,421
I haven't the slightest clue.

1074
01:35:30,525 --> 01:35:36,794
There are sympathies and antipathies,
trying to cancel each other out.

1075
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:40,459
I'll just listen some more.

1076
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:51,735
I got it.

1077
01:35:59,454 --> 01:36:03,288
Close call,
but the sympathy meter needle

1078
01:36:03,358 --> 01:36:08,318
just managed to sway
in favor of Ravn and his staff.

1079
