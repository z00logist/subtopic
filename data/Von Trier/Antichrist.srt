1
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:52,093
How are you?

2
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,602
Didn't we just talk about that?

3
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:00,402
That was yesterday.

4
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,571
Today is Tuesday.

5
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,220
So I've been here long?

6
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,090
A month.

7
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:18,949
Wayne Says

8
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:24,088
My grief pattern is atypical

9
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:30,137
Yeah

10
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:37,196
Got to talk with Wayne.

11
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:41,735
I think he gives too much medication
Way too much

12
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,714
Stop it, please.

13
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,774
trust on this to be smarter than you.

14
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:50,873
He strayed out of medical school
He don't know what he's doing

15
00:07:51,113 --> 00:07:53,673
I've treated ten tenths
as many patients as he has

16
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:57,512
But you're not a doctor.

17
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,062
No, I'm not

18
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:04,131
And I'm proud that I'm not a doctor like him.

19
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:07,581
There is nothing ...

20
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,681
atypical about your grief

21
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:21,639
It was my fault.

22
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:25,848
What about me?

23
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:27,478
I was there too.

24
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:29,427
I could have stopped him.

25
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,177
No.

26
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,036
You didn't know that he...

27
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:39,036
Started waking up lately

28
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:46,235
I was aware that he would sometimes ...

29
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:48,104
wake up

30
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:52,074
And crawl out of bed

31
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:54,313
And walk about

32
00:08:56,563 --> 00:08:59,233
Just as you thought that
he was soundly asleep

33
00:09:00,282 --> 00:09:02,072
He could open the baby gate

34
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:05,612
He ...

35
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:07,091
He woke up ...

36
00:09:10,991 --> 00:09:11,991
And w...

37
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:14,270
Was confused

38
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:23,369
Hey!

39
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:46,145
Dr.Wayne says he won't be back home.

40
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:52,374
You couldn't leave it, could you?

41
00:09:52,784 --> 00:09:53,984
You had to mettle.

42
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:55,454
This place leads nowhere.

43
00:09:56,873 --> 00:09:57,873
On the contrary ...

44
00:09:59,643 --> 00:10:00,643
Grief

45
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:04,267
It's not a disease ...

46
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:06,302
It's a natural healthy reaction.

47
00:10:06,502 --> 00:10:08,232
You can't just remove it
You mustn't ...

48
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:12,081
Wayne knows you're a therapist

49
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:15,311
He said you shouldn't treat your own family

50
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,410
In principle I agree, but ...

51
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,340
But you're just so much smarter

52
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,729
Aren't you?

53
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:24,609
I love you.

54
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:30,518
Nothing hurts more than
to see the one thy in love ...

55
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,558
Subjected to mistakes and wrongs

56
00:10:35,237 --> 00:10:38,187
No therapist can know
as much about you as I do

57
00:12:53,755 --> 00:12:55,505
- It hurts.
- I know.

58
00:12:57,865 --> 00:12:58,865
There's no way around it.

59
00:13:04,134 --> 00:13:05,223
I want to talk to ...

60
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:07,223
I'm not gonna let you do that.

61
00:13:12,522 --> 00:13:14,352
Why not just go all alone?

62
00:13:14,972 --> 00:13:15,972
No.

63
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:17,612
A little change.

64
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:22,001
Wouldn't get any worse ...

65
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Yes, it will.

66
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,917
You're always been distant from me and Nick

67
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:53,636
Ever I come to think of it

68
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:55,955
Very very distant

69
00:13:58,235 --> 00:13:59,235
Okay

70
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:02,164
Can you give me some examples
from this?

71
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:07,344
Hell, That's not that difficult to understand.

72
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:14,333
I've lost someone, for instance...

73
00:14:16,432 --> 00:14:18,112
You terribly distant lost someone

74
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:21,771
As a father ...

75
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:23,531
And as a husband.

76
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,851
And that was Nick's last summer

77
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,020
you missed that on

78
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,650
Too bad

79
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:36,749
I never interested you.

80
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:38,889
Until now.

81
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:41,318
That I'm your patient.

82
00:14:43,998 --> 00:14:46,557
Perhaps I'm not supposed
to talk about these things

83
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:49,137
There is nothing you can't talk about

84
00:14:53,086 --> 00:14:56,216
You are indifferent
to whether your child is alive or dead

85
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:07,464
I bet you have a lot of
clever therapist replies to that.

86
00:15:07,964 --> 00:15:08,964
Haven't you?

87
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:15,573
Well, actually ...

88
00:15:17,782 --> 00:15:18,691
It was to ...

89
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:19,692
Honor your wish.

90
00:15:20,472 --> 00:15:21,712
You wanted peace to write.

91
00:15:23,482 --> 00:15:24,531
Perhaps I didn't mean it

92
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:27,481
What I understood ...

93
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:30,820
Is that you want me to ride alone

94
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,280
That you and Nick,
were going to go to Eden.

95
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
Just the two of you

96
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:38,509
That way
you could finish your thesis

97
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,678
But I didn't

98
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:45,788
You didn't?

99
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:47,668
You see?

100
00:15:48,258 --> 00:15:49,307
You didn't even know that.

101
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:51,857
Why did you give up?
That's not like you

102
00:15:52,347 --> 00:15:55,356
The hope project Just seemed ...
Less important upthere.

103
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:59,376
As you said,
When I like told you about my subject...

104
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,126
Glib

105
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:03,185
I never called your subject glib

106
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,215
Perhaps you didn't use that word,
but that's what you meant.

107
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:09,494
And all of a sudden
It was glib

108
00:16:13,324 --> 00:16:15,613
Or even was ...
some kind of lie.

109
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:17,353
I see

110
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:19,633
No, You don't see.

111
00:16:20,852 --> 00:16:21,882
You see a lot of things

112
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:23,122
But not that.

113
00:17:52,178 --> 00:17:54,457
Inhale...
On a count of five

114
00:17:56,267 --> 00:17:57,617
Call me, call me.

115
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,776
Just ... Follow me ...

116
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,476
Do it with me ... Inhale ...

117
00:18:02,506 --> 00:18:03,635
Inhale ...

118
00:18:03,636 --> 00:18:04,966
on a count to five ...

119
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:09,095
Inhale... Two

120
00:18:13,394 --> 00:18:14,394
Stay with me ...

121
00:18:14,614 --> 00:18:16,854
Stay with me ...
I'm Gonna teach you how to breathe.

122
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:18,574
Inhale ...

123
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:21,083
2 ... 3 ...

124
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,943
4, 5, hold.

125
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:25,838
2 ... 3 ...

126
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:28,582
4, 5, exhale ...

127
00:18:29,102 --> 00:18:30,102
Good.

128
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,242
Imagine ...

129
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:33,471
Imagine you're blowing on your ...

130
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:36,081
Vessel plumbs

131
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:38,191
Calmly, quietly ...

132
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,310
Yes, yes, that's good.

133
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,869
That's good.

134
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:50,399
That's very good.

135
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:53,988
I told you there would be a change.

136
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,557
You're still mourning
but you're in a new phase.

137
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:04,800
What phase?

138
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:05,801
Anxiety.

139
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:08,886
Anxiety.

140
00:19:08,996 --> 00:19:09,995
Yes

141
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:12,065
This is physical.

142
00:19:15,995 --> 00:19:17,084
It's dangerous.

143
00:19:17,174 --> 00:19:18,304
No, it's not dangerous.

144
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:21,894
Just as your grief wasn't dangerous

145
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:24,713
a main part of anxiety

146
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:25,973
Is physical

147
00:19:26,393 --> 00:19:27,633
Dizzy spells

148
00:19:28,623 --> 00:19:29,622
Dry mouth ...

149
00:19:30,592 --> 00:19:32,052
misguided hearing ...

150
00:19:32,442 --> 00:19:33,442
Trembling

151
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:35,171
Heavy breathing ...

152
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:36,461
Less pulse ...

153
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:37,751
Nausea ...

154
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,239
Hey!

155
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,697
Easy ...

156
00:19:56,698 --> 00:19:58,198
Never screw your therapist.

157
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,547
No matter how much
your therapist may like it

158
00:20:04,257 --> 00:20:05,827
I know that distracts you, but ...

159
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,706
It's not good for us.

160
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:09,146
Do the breathing.

161
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,988
Hold

162
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:16,095
Exhale

163
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:18,437
You love me?

164
00:20:19,524 --> 00:20:20,524
Yes, I do

165
00:20:23,612 --> 00:20:24,572
Then help me.

166
00:20:29,001 --> 00:20:29,824
It's what I'm doing

167
00:20:37,622 --> 00:20:38,621
Exposure

168
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,031
That's the only thing that really works ...

169
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:44,719
Everything else is ...

170
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,720
Just talk

171
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:51,268
You have to have the courage
to stay in the situation that frightens you.

172
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:54,675
And then you'll learn
that fear isn't dangerous.

173
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,241
Let's make a list of things
you're afraid of.

174
00:21:00,668 --> 00:21:03,435
In the top
You put the situation you fear the most

175
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:11,207
But I don't know
what I'm afraid of

176
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:16,995
Just ... take your time.

177
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,760
I'm thinking.

178
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:21,205
Okay

179
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,210
I'm thinking, but ...

180
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,240
Can't I just be afraid
without a definite object?

181
00:22:33,913 --> 00:22:34,913
No, no!

182
00:23:17,786 --> 00:23:19,426
This won't do

183
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,026
Stupe Stupidest thing I could do to you

184
00:23:31,629 --> 00:23:32,863
If you can't tell me ...

185
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:35,913
What your fear's of.

186
00:23:36,354 --> 00:23:38,331
Maybe it would be easier for you to tell me

187
00:23:38,703 --> 00:23:40,053
Where you're afraid?

188
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:43,150
Where would you feel most exposed?

189
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:46,816
What would be the worst place?

190
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:51,221
An apartment?

191
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
The street?

192
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,379
A store?

193
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:03,179
The park?

194
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,282
Listening to someone, maybe.

195
00:24:20,446 --> 00:24:21,672
The woods.

196
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:24,655
The woods?

197
00:24:29,355 --> 00:24:30,355
The woods, yes.

198
00:24:30,395 --> 00:24:32,104
It's funny because ...

199
00:24:32,284 --> 00:24:34,914
you were the one that always wanted
to go into the woods

200
00:24:37,378 --> 00:24:43,470
What scares you about the woods?
What frightens you... there?

201
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,152
Everything

202
00:24:54,748 --> 00:24:57,496
Tell me what you think
is supposed to happen in the woods.

203
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:06,089
Eh?

204
00:25:08,552 --> 00:25:10,182
Is it any woods in particular?

205
00:25:17,387 --> 00:25:18,426
Eden.

206
00:25:18,427 --> 00:25:19,927
Eden?

207
00:25:25,128 --> 00:25:27,231
What do you say we put...

208
00:25:28,605 --> 00:25:32,405
A garden round Eden
at the top of the pyramid?

209
00:25:34,554 --> 00:25:35,554
No.

210
00:25:36,374 --> 00:25:37,864
Not quite at the top.

211
00:25:49,242 --> 00:25:50,242
No.

212
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,860
Okay

213
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:18,757
It's... It's okay

214
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:20,758
- I'm sorry
- It's okay

215
00:27:02,177 --> 00:27:04,074
We can start by working on your expectations

216
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,720
Close your eyes.

217
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,358
Feel the seat underneath you.

218
00:27:17,086 --> 00:27:19,476
Feel yourself sinking down into it

219
00:27:20,794 --> 00:27:21,872
Folding you ...

220
00:27:23,756 --> 00:27:24,655
It's a nice feeling.

221
00:27:27,404 --> 00:27:29,630
What you feel is a pleasant warmth

222
00:27:30,488 --> 00:27:31,699
and heaviness

223
00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:36,374
your breath... is deep

224
00:27:38,355 --> 00:27:42,754
I gather
You sink ...

225
00:27:43,484 --> 00:27:44,484
Down ...

226
00:27:46,051 --> 00:27:47,322
Imagine you're at Eden.

227
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:52,150
Imagine you arrived
at Eden through the woods.

228
00:27:55,762 --> 00:27:57,322
Tell me what you see?

229
00:28:03,221 --> 00:28:04,570
I'm at the bridge.

230
00:28:06,354 --> 00:28:07,378
It's evening

231
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,949
Almost no voice can be heard.

232
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,187
The water is running without a sound.

233
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:21,737
Darkness comes out anytime here

234
00:28:24,587 --> 00:28:25,737
I walk into it

235
00:28:39,657 --> 00:28:42,005
The little deers ... are hiding.

236
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,804
Among their friends. As usual.

237
00:28:46,734 --> 00:28:49,113
Is it Difficult to go upthere?

238
00:28:50,473 --> 00:28:51,473
No.

239
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:53,263
Not really.

240
00:28:55,412 --> 00:28:57,092
That is almost okay

241
00:29:06,881 --> 00:29:08,590
In a mountain of trees ...

242
00:29:09,884 --> 00:29:10,827
Almosty

243
00:29:12,713 --> 00:29:14,346
There's a built foxhole

244
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:19,746
How do you feel there?

245
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:24,248
I can't really tell.

246
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,637
It should be easy ...

247
00:29:27,672 --> 00:29:28,747
passing

248
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:30,917
And yet ...

249
00:29:32,007 --> 00:29:33,826
It's like walking through mud.

250
00:29:44,685 --> 00:29:45,624
The trunk is thick

251
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:50,844
the dear old ****

252
00:29:53,503 --> 00:29:56,243
It has some strange kind of personality.

253
00:29:58,242 --> 00:29:59,432
I've always found that.

254
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:07,141
No.

255
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:11,680
Where are you, are you...?
Are you heading for the cabin?

256
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:15,920
Yes, I am

257
00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:21,689
I'm walking up above ...

258
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,828
Through the tall grass ...

259
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:25,188
Then don't come in.

260
00:30:26,298 --> 00:30:27,188
Don't go in.

261
00:30:29,117 --> 00:30:30,717
You see outside you're afraid of

262
00:30:30,737 --> 00:30:31,867
Don't look around ...

263
00:30:33,077 --> 00:30:34,237
No.

264
00:30:35,386 --> 00:30:36,806
Lie down on the green.

265
00:30:40,196 --> 00:30:41,595
You want me to lie down?

266
00:30:41,795 --> 00:30:43,315
Lie down on the grass.

267
00:30:46,795 --> 00:30:48,484
On top of all the plants?

268
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,174
Yes, lie down on the plants.

269
00:31:04,422 --> 00:31:05,382
Are you lying down?

270
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:08,441
Yes

271
00:31:10,431 --> 00:31:11,351
Good

272
00:31:12,011 --> 00:31:13,490
What is everything like around you?

273
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,360
Green.

274
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,349
It's all very green.

275
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:23,849
Good

276
00:31:26,078 --> 00:31:27,828
Now will you do what I ask you?

277
00:31:30,508 --> 00:31:31,338
Yes

278
00:31:32,397 --> 00:31:33,577
What do you want me to do?

279
00:31:36,347 --> 00:31:37,357
I want you...

280
00:31:38,816 --> 00:31:40,626
To melt... into the green.

281
00:31:42,546 --> 00:31:43,536
Don't fight it.

282
00:31:44,935 --> 00:31:45,935
Just ...

283
00:31:46,115 --> 00:31:47,665
Turn green.

284
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:59,393
No matter what happens
you were there. You did it.

285
00:32:02,693 --> 00:32:04,592
Let fear come, if it likes.

286
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:06,122
Remember.

287
00:32:06,322 --> 00:32:09,122
But the mind can concieve
and believe it can achieve

288
00:33:00,763 --> 00:33:01,733
What's wrong?

289
00:33:02,603 --> 00:33:03,733
Ground is burning.

290
00:33:04,893 --> 00:33:06,362
The ground is not burning.

291
00:33:11,972 --> 00:33:12,871
Gotta go.

292
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:33,808
I want to lie down.

293
00:33:34,978 --> 00:33:35,808
Just for a minute.

294
00:33:38,627 --> 00:33:39,587
Sure.

295
00:33:40,797 --> 00:33:41,827
Yea. We'll take a rest.

296
00:36:11,063 --> 00:36:12,113
Shouldn't we go home?

297
00:36:19,352 --> 00:36:20,372
Yeah

298
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:23,481
Yeah, we should.

299
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:30,830
Scared?

300
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,270
Stay awake for me.

301
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:41,869
Relax

302
00:37:42,918 --> 00:37:44,778
Stay ... stay in there.

303
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:52,168
It's just stupid acorns

304
00:42:21,574 --> 00:42:22,514
What are you doing?

305
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,414
I'm just ...

306
00:42:26,093 --> 00:42:29,083
Setting up... a little exercise.

307
00:42:30,593 --> 00:42:32,892
It's... It's like a ...

308
00:42:35,202 --> 00:42:36,362
It's like a game.

309
00:42:36,732 --> 00:42:38,112
You cheated me yesterday.

310
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,361
Running is not good.

311
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:43,001
... You have to
really feel the grass.

312
00:42:44,341 --> 00:42:45,820
I want you to go from this stone ...

313
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,100
To this stone.

314
00:42:50,889 --> 00:42:52,249
Pretty scary, huh?

315
00:42:53,619 --> 00:42:54,539
You're ready?

316
00:42:56,179 --> 00:42:57,119
Yea

317
00:42:58,058 --> 00:42:59,048
I'll give you a ride.

318
00:43:00,808 --> 00:43:02,338
I'll put you on the first stone.

319
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:06,757
Stay with me

320
00:43:08,267 --> 00:43:09,077
Here we go

321
00:43:09,617 --> 00:43:11,216
Put your foot down
I got you.

322
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:13,436
I got you
I'm right here.

323
00:43:14,206 --> 00:43:15,236
I can't do this.

324
00:43:15,271 --> 00:43:16,455
Yes, you can.

325
00:43:17,135 --> 00:43:18,685
You can and you will.

326
00:43:18,835 --> 00:43:20,065
Just like I will.

327
00:43:20,215 --> 00:43:22,065
We're gonna walk together.

328
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:23,714
We're gonna walk together, okay?

329
00:43:23,749 --> 00:43:24,844
Now ...

330
00:43:25,284 --> 00:43:26,844
Alright now, Breathe.

331
00:43:27,554 --> 00:43:28,843
Let's step off the rock.

332
00:43:29,713 --> 00:43:31,383
And step on that grass.

333
00:43:32,403 --> 00:43:33,263
Step down

334
00:43:33,783 --> 00:43:36,142
See? ... What happened?

335
00:43:36,472 --> 00:43:38,502
Keep breathing ...
See? Keep breathing

336
00:43:38,572 --> 00:43:40,212
I've got you

337
00:43:40,247 --> 00:43:41,851
You're really doing great

338
00:43:41,891 --> 00:43:44,021
Okay? ... keep breathing.

339
00:43:44,056 --> 00:43:46,151
Five, five and five.

340
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,080
You're almost there.

341
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:53,580
You're almost there
You're doing great

342
00:43:56,569 --> 00:43:57,749
... Five.

343
00:44:02,668 --> 00:44:04,328
We're there ... We are there

344
00:44:04,438 --> 00:44:05,378
Here, told you

345
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:11,707
You did it

346
00:44:15,296 --> 00:44:16,326
You learned something.

347
00:44:18,985 --> 00:44:20,125
Didn't you?

348
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:25,604
You did beautiful.

349
00:44:27,744 --> 00:44:28,734
You did beautiful.

350
00:45:18,346 --> 00:45:19,876
I miss him so much ...

351
00:45:40,133 --> 00:45:41,812
I've been afraid of here before.

352
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:45,662
Yes, it seems likely.

353
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:49,591
I just didn't know it was fear.

354
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:58,570
I became afraid
... and I stopped writing.

355
00:46:01,169 --> 00:46:03,359
What was different ... the last time?

356
00:46:09,688 --> 00:46:10,738
I heard a sound.

357
00:46:31,824 --> 00:46:32,784
Nick?

358
00:46:36,154 --> 00:46:37,313
Nick!

359
00:46:43,932 --> 00:46:45,022
Nick!

360
00:46:54,921 --> 00:46:55,751
Nick!

361
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,089
Nick!

362
00:48:06,889 --> 00:48:08,389
You didn't hear Nick screaming.

363
00:48:13,128 --> 00:48:14,318
Apparently not.

364
00:48:14,818 --> 00:48:18,362
And because you experienced
something that you can't explain rationally,

365
00:48:18,397 --> 00:48:20,907
You placed
Eden very high on the pyramid chart.

366
00:48:26,456 --> 00:48:28,996
Eden was the catalyst
that triggered your fear.

367
00:48:29,276 --> 00:48:30,995
You jumped to conclusions.

368
00:48:31,655 --> 00:48:34,025
Entitled the emotional event with a place.

369
00:48:35,795 --> 00:48:38,044
When you feel threat
It's natural to react.

370
00:48:38,804 --> 00:48:40,204
If the danger were real ...

371
00:48:40,554 --> 00:48:42,034
Your fear would save your life.

372
00:48:42,364 --> 00:48:45,873
Because your adrenaline will be used
for fight or flight.

373
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,322
But what you're experiencing
is panic, nothing more.

374
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,132
The scream wasn't real

375
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,150
Stop!

376
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:09,829
Calm down.

377
00:49:10,749 --> 00:49:12,189
You shouldn't have come here.

378
00:49:13,809 --> 00:49:15,988
You're just so damn arrogant.

379
00:49:18,048 --> 00:49:19,688
But this may not last.

380
00:49:21,537 --> 00:49:22,717
Have you thought of that?

381
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:37,115
Oak trees grow to be hundreds of years old

382
00:49:38,735 --> 00:49:42,424
They only have to produce
one single tree, every hundred years.

383
00:49:42,934 --> 00:49:44,424
In order to perpetuate ...

384
00:49:44,944 --> 00:49:46,423
May sound benign to you but ...

385
00:49:47,053 --> 00:49:50,533
It was a big thing for me to realize that
when I was out here with Nick.

386
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,201
The acorns fell on the roof then too...

387
00:50:01,191 --> 00:50:03,951
Kept falling, and falling

388
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:07,570
And dying ... and dying.

389
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:14,739
And I understood that ...

390
00:50:17,259 --> 00:50:20,198
Everything that used to be beautiful about Eden

391
00:50:21,558 --> 00:50:23,068
Was perhaps hideous

392
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:30,127
Now I could hear
what I couldn't hear before.

393
00:50:33,466 --> 00:50:37,175
The cry of... all the things that are to die

394
00:50:42,115 --> 00:50:43,144
It's all...

395
00:50:44,214 --> 00:50:45,304
very touching

396
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:48,514
If it was a children's book.

397
00:50:52,303 --> 00:50:53,933
acorns don't cry

398
00:50:55,832 --> 00:50:57,412
You know that as well as I do.

399
00:50:58,482 --> 00:50:59,962
That's what fear is.

400
00:51:01,432 --> 00:51:03,941
Your thoughts distort reality.

401
00:51:05,631 --> 00:51:07,131
Look the other way around ...

402
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:14,689
Satan's Church

403
00:51:14,724 --> 00:51:16,089
Satan?... Jesus!

404
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,982
Nature is Satan's Church.

405
00:51:19,919 --> 00:51:20,848
What?

406
00:51:24,308 --> 00:51:25,618
Well, there you have him

407
00:51:27,457 --> 00:51:28,637
That was his brother.

408
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:00,572
Nick?

409
00:52:02,342 --> 00:52:04,372
He drifted away from me the last time.

410
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:09,851
He was always out and about...

411
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:13,560
He might have made more of an effort
to be there for me.

412
00:54:13,021 --> 00:54:14,501
You look like you slept well.

413
00:54:15,851 --> 00:54:17,000
Thanks, I did.

414
00:54:23,919 --> 00:54:26,629
I just wanted to say how happy
I am that you're here ...

415
00:54:30,718 --> 00:54:31,758
I love you darling...

416
00:54:41,137 --> 00:54:43,166
Did you have a good sleep?

417
00:54:45,436 --> 00:54:46,926
I've just been having a lot of ...

418
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:48,925
crazy dreams ...

419
00:54:50,155 --> 00:54:52,955
Dreams are of no interest
in modern psychology.

420
00:54:54,484 --> 00:54:56,054
Freud is dead, isn't he?

421
00:55:15,981 --> 00:55:17,181
What are you doing?

422
00:55:17,381 --> 00:55:18,611
Look!

423
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,470
I'm well again.

424
00:55:31,239 --> 00:55:32,438
I'm cured.

425
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,198
See? perfect.

426
00:55:39,577 --> 00:55:40,827
I'm fine.

427
00:55:47,646 --> 00:55:49,656
You can't just be happy for me, can you?

428
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:59,475
Chaos ... reigns

429
00:58:09,618 --> 00:58:13,507
Chapter Three: The despair

430
01:02:09,465 --> 01:02:11,345
I want to do one more excercise.

431
01:02:11,845 --> 01:02:13,175
It's like a role play.

432
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:16,154
My role ...

433
01:02:16,954 --> 01:02:18,074
Is ..

434
01:02:18,664 --> 01:02:20,584
All the thoughts
that provoke your fear ...

435
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:22,583
Yours ...

436
01:02:22,683 --> 01:02:23,903
is rational thinking.

437
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:30,552
I am nature ...

438
01:02:32,012 --> 01:02:33,581
All the things that you call nature.

439
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:43,630
Okay Mr.Nature

440
01:02:46,689 --> 01:02:47,919
what do you want?

441
01:02:51,699 --> 01:02:53,308
To hurt you as much as I can.

442
01:02:59,997 --> 01:03:00,897
How?

443
01:03:02,727 --> 01:03:03,887
How do you think?

444
01:03:11,385 --> 01:03:12,625
By Frightening me?

445
01:03:16,385 --> 01:03:17,415
By killing you.

446
01:03:20,564 --> 01:03:21,874
Nature can't hurt me.

447
01:03:22,914 --> 01:03:24,733
You just told you're the green in the outside...

448
01:03:25,123 --> 01:03:26,733
No, I'm more than that.

449
01:03:29,563 --> 01:03:30,742
I don't understand.

450
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:35,092
I'm outside, but also...

451
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:39,721
within

452
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:44,110
I'm nature of all human beings

453
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:47,040
Oh, That kind of nature.

454
01:03:52,149 --> 01:03:53,749
The kind of nature that...

455
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:57,878
Causes people do
the evil things against women

456
01:03:57,918 --> 01:03:59,688
That's exactly who I am.

457
01:04:00,218 --> 01:04:03,187
That kind of nature interested me a lot.

458
01:04:03,837 --> 01:04:05,107
When I was uphere

459
01:04:06,487 --> 01:04:09,346
That kind of nature
was the subject to my thesis ...

460
01:04:12,496 --> 01:04:14,725
But you shouldn't underestimate Eden.

461
01:04:17,785 --> 01:04:18,805
What did Eden do?

462
01:04:19,795 --> 01:04:22,804
I discovered somethng else
in my material than I expected.

463
01:04:25,664 --> 01:04:27,913
If human nature is evil...

464
01:04:29,123 --> 01:04:30,733
Then that goes as well...

465
01:04:30,768 --> 01:04:32,733
That the nature ...

466
01:04:33,712 --> 01:04:34,732
of the women.

467
01:04:37,512 --> 01:04:38,642
Female nature.

468
01:04:39,012 --> 01:04:41,161
The nature of all the sisters.

469
01:04:43,911 --> 01:04:46,360
Women do not
control their own bodies

470
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:48,110
Nature does.

471
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:51,430
I have it in writing in my books.

472
01:04:52,189 --> 01:04:54,359
The literature you used
in your office search...

473
01:04:54,509 --> 01:04:57,554
Was about evil things
committed against women.

474
01:04:57,589 --> 01:05:00,488
But you read it as proof
of the evil of women?

475
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:04,517
You were supposed to be critical of those says
That was your thesis

476
01:05:05,297 --> 01:05:06,957
Instead you're embracing it

477
01:05:07,747 --> 01:05:09,207
Do you know what you're saying?

478
01:05:11,286 --> 01:05:12,356
Forget it.

479
01:05:13,056 --> 01:05:14,716
I do not know why I said it.

480
01:05:16,186 --> 01:05:17,975
It can't work anymore now.

481
01:05:29,703 --> 01:05:30,953
Hit me.

482
01:05:31,883 --> 01:05:32,823
What?

483
01:05:32,933 --> 01:05:34,823
Hit me so it hurts ...

484
01:05:35,513 --> 01:05:36,502
No.

485
01:05:36,692 --> 01:05:38,052
Hit me, please.

486
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:39,342
No!

487
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:41,482
I can't stand it

488
01:05:42,141 --> 01:05:43,481
I do not want to

489
01:05:43,601 --> 01:05:45,021
I do not want to...

490
01:05:56,029 --> 01:05:57,579
Then you don't love me.

491
01:06:00,819 --> 01:06:02,408
Okay

492
01:06:03,328 --> 01:06:04,678
Maybe I don't love you.

493
01:06:04,688 --> 01:06:05,598
Yeah

494
01:07:00,369 --> 01:07:01,619
Again ...

495
01:07:02,249 --> 01:07:03,499
Again.

496
01:07:08,548 --> 01:07:10,397
This is too from nature's spell ...

497
01:07:10,797 --> 01:07:12,397
Could start a hail storm ...

498
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:57,510
I'm not gonna continue this
if you don't listen to me.

499
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:01,459
Good... and evil.

500
01:08:02,049 --> 01:08:03,849
Have nothing to do with therapy.

501
01:08:06,009 --> 01:08:10,508
You know how many innocent women were
killed in the sixteenth century alone

502
01:08:10,658 --> 01:08:11,948
just for being women?

503
01:08:12,558 --> 01:08:13,947
I'm sure you do... Many.

504
01:08:15,517 --> 01:08:17,257
Not because they were evil...

505
01:08:18,747 --> 01:08:19,616
I know.

506
01:08:20,686 --> 01:08:22,476
It's just sometimes I forget.

507
01:08:26,455 --> 01:08:29,405
The evil you talk about is an obsession.

508
01:08:30,325 --> 01:08:33,494
Obsessions never materialize.
It's a scientific fact.

509
01:08:34,764 --> 01:08:38,673
Anxieties can't trick you into doing things
you won't do otherwise...

510
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:39,818
It's like hypnotizing you

511
01:08:39,853 --> 01:08:42,993
You can't be hypnotized into doin
something you wouldn't...

512
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,212
Normally do.
Something against your nature.

513
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:49,942
You understand me?

514
01:08:50,841 --> 01:08:52,151
Yeah, I think so.

515
01:08:52,331 --> 01:08:55,141
You think so?
You don't have to understand me, just trust me.

516
01:09:15,438 --> 01:09:16,487
What's this?

517
01:09:17,176 --> 01:09:19,429
It's from the medical officer
It's a copy of the autopsy report.

518
01:09:23,486 --> 01:09:24,466
The autopsy?

519
01:09:27,066 --> 01:09:28,745
They performed an autopsy?

520
01:09:29,595 --> 01:09:31,585
I didn't wanna tell you,
because you weren't feeling well.

521
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,174
Well

522
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:36,594
What did they find?

523
01:09:37,994 --> 01:09:39,434
Nothing that would have any ...

524
01:09:39,804 --> 01:09:41,073
bearing on the case.

525
01:09:42,403 --> 01:09:43,863
The only abnormality

526
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:46,498
in the victim is a slight deformity

527
01:09:46,533 --> 01:09:49,612
of the bones in his feet,
of an earlier date

528
01:09:51,602 --> 01:09:54,501
We did not attention a significance to this.

529
01:10:08,779 --> 01:10:12,029
You were rather to put Nick's shoes on
wrong in this picture?

530
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:18,737
Well

531
01:10:20,937 --> 01:10:23,877
How I would?!

532
01:10:25,007 --> 01:10:26,476
A slip of the mind that day?

533
01:10:26,976 --> 01:10:27,896
I wish

534
01:11:35,775 --> 01:11:36,905
Herself.

535
01:11:40,584 --> 01:11:43,384
Bastard.
You're leaving me, aren't you?

536
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:46,414
get off me, bastard.

537
01:11:47,703 --> 01:11:48,863
You're leaving me.

538
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:50,133
I'm not.

539
01:11:50,413 --> 01:11:51,538
I'm helping you.

540
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:53,232
- You're leaving me, aren't you?
- No!

541
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:09,680
- I love you.
- I don't believe you!

542
01:12:09,715 --> 01:12:10,860
Yes

543
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,629
I don't believe you!

544
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:14,630
I don't fucking believe you!

545
01:17:18,741 --> 01:17:19,861
Where are you?

546
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,770
You bastard!

547
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:27,379
Where are you?

548
01:17:36,908 --> 01:17:37,888
Where are you?

549
01:17:52,245 --> 01:17:53,295
Where are you?

550
01:18:02,524 --> 01:18:03,494
Where are you?

551
01:18:09,343 --> 01:18:10,392
You bastard!

552
01:18:21,841 --> 01:18:22,751
Where are you?

553
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:27,370
Where are you?

554
01:18:31,779 --> 01:18:33,029
How dare you leave me?

555
01:18:44,747 --> 01:18:46,757
You said you wanted to help me.

556
01:18:48,456 --> 01:18:49,686
Where are you?

557
01:18:53,546 --> 01:18:54,485
Where are you?

558
01:20:17,262 --> 01:20:18,342
Where are you?

559
01:20:23,321 --> 01:20:24,501
You bastard!

560
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:37,030
Get out!

561
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,349
Get out! You bastard!

562
01:21:40,879 --> 01:21:42,009
Get out!

563
01:21:43,919 --> 01:21:45,278
You bastard!

564
01:21:46,038 --> 01:21:47,108
Get out!

565
01:21:49,558 --> 01:21:50,597
Get out!

566
01:22:11,054 --> 01:22:12,264
Get out!

567
01:22:14,494 --> 01:22:15,643
You bastard!

568
01:22:17,643 --> 01:22:18,693
Get out!

569
01:23:19,043 --> 01:23:20,083
Sorry.

570
01:24:07,086 --> 01:24:11,035
You gotta get this thing off... my leg

571
01:24:32,952 --> 01:24:34,162
I can't find the wrench.

572
01:25:39,381 --> 01:25:40,541
Did you want to kill me?

573
01:25:42,391 --> 01:25:43,401
Not yet

574
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,410
The three beggars aren't here yet.

575
01:25:49,869 --> 01:25:50,909
The three beggars?

576
01:25:53,799 --> 01:25:54,849
What does that mean?

577
01:25:56,728 --> 01:25:58,438
When the three beggars arrive ...

578
01:25:59,298 --> 01:26:00,438
Someone must die.

579
01:26:03,797 --> 01:26:04,777
I see.

580
01:26:29,113 --> 01:26:31,523
The crying woman
is a scheming woman.

581
01:26:43,431 --> 01:26:46,840
False in legs
False in thighs

582
01:26:48,890 --> 01:26:52,520
False in breasts
Teeth, hair and eyes

583
01:28:44,742 --> 01:28:45,782
Hold me

584
01:28:50,301 --> 01:28:51,281
Hold me

585
01:30:15,787 --> 01:30:17,877
There is no such constellation.

586
01:30:45,562 --> 01:30:46,972
None of it is any use

587
01:30:47,262 --> 01:30:48,762
Not good.

588
01:30:54,751 --> 01:30:55,771
No!
