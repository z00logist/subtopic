1
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,470
You're sweating.

2
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,440
I know. I'm excited though.
I can see it all happening.

3
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,820
A little turn...

4
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,050
Now side to side.

5
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,250
Other people can sing.

6
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,970
Can we talk out here
for a minute?

7
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,970
She's fantastic.

8
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,910
What are you
talking about?

9
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,710
I think she sings funny.

10
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,940
And her dancing's not
all that great either.

11
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,770
That's the first time
she did it, okay?

12
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,750
Yeah, but I had
all the kits by then.

13
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,980
Because she didn't
take the kettle,

14
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,590
so I was stuck.

15
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,220
Do you want me to
take the kettle, Samuel?

16
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,090
No, I don't.
I just want Kathy

17
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,830
to put it over here.
This is, you know...

18
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,630
If you say these words,
and then, boom,

19
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,930
you just put
your hands out,

20
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,360
and there they are.
They're there.

21
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,360
Please don't
drop the props, Kathy.

22
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,510
Wait, wait.

23
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,910
Why are you putting it
on her head, though?

24
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,680
I'm a little confused.

25
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,620
I don't know.
It was, uh...

26
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,450
Because she's not
going to pick it up.

27
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,290
It looks like
you're trying to...

28
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,060
put a hat on her head
or something.

29
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,620
You're fantastic.

30
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,860
You just have to listen
to your heart, Cvalda.

31
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,730
I don't want you
to call me Cvalda.

32
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,160
Okay, Paul, please.

33
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,630
You're Cvalda
to me.

34
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,560
Let's do some sound effects.

35
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,630
Wait!

36
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,930
I told you
no tapping

37
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,260
in "The Sound
of Music."

38
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,170
It really needs rhythm.

39
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,530
Like drums or something.

40
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,900
Everybody's
doing a great job.

41
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,390
Really.

42
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,920
"L-T-U..."

43
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,320
Oh, hello, Selma.
Come here.

44
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,160
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

45
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,600
Okay, you know
where to stand.

46
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,660
Yeah.

47
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,300
So let's try
this one.

48
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,170
"F-E-Z-T."

49
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,770
Maybe
even this one.

50
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,570
"T-E-F-P-O..."

51
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,440
I think you can work
that machine safely.

52
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,510
I'll write a note
to the plant

53
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,750
and let them know.

54
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,650
Thank you.

55
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,750
Bye.

56
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,950
Goodbye.

57
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,020
Bye.

58
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,080
Goodbye.

59
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,350
We lost five hours
'cause some idiot

60
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,480
broke the machine.

61
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,390
Bill's here.

62
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,390
So?

63
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,560
Well, he's here
with Gene.

64
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,430
Oh, that sounds
like bad news.

65
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,930
What are you
going to do?

66
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,920
Well, I guess I got
to tell her, don't i?

67
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,240
You can't bring
the script to work, Selma.

68
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,750
Keep your eyes
on the machine, okay?

69
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,340
Yeah.

70
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,850
Sure.

71
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,650
Bill's here.

72
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,990
Bill?

73
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,120
He's here with Gene.

74
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,900
Not again!

75
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,730
You got to come
right back, okay?

76
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,970
Don't be too worried.

77
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,610
We're gonna work this out.

78
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,940
Here she comes.

79
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,650
Why are you
not in school?!

80
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,190
Uhh...

81
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,390
When I say so,
you go to school!

82
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,630
Do you think I joke?

83
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,230
You have to study!

84
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,900
Come on, Selma, stop.

85
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,070
We talked about this.
Didn't we talk about it?

86
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,240
Hanging out with those
automobile thieves.

87
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,000
So what?

88
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,740
He's learning.

89
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,240
Selma,
he's learning.

90
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,410
Aw, come on.

91
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,450
Gene, this is the most
important thing.

92
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,350
You have to go to school.

93
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,650
Selma, l--I can...

94
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,420
drive him back to school
if you like.

95
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,220
Since when was that
your business?

96
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,460
What you doing here?

97
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,360
If you need
a ride home--

98
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,860
I don't
even punch out

99
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,960
until after
another two hours.

100
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,000
Sometimes you punch out
around this time.

101
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,730
I never punch out early!

102
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,320
Don't need a dumb...

103
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,700
Don't need a ride!

104
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,440
In your little head.

105
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,610
All right.

106
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,840
Come on, Mr. G.
Let's get you to school.

107
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,300
Thank you, but l...

108
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,900
I'll just...
I'll just ride my bike.

109
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,300
Bye, Jeff.

110
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,140
She likes you.

111
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,580
I'm sure of it.

112
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,940
You're sure?

113
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,840
Yeah, I'm sure of it.

114
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,580
This is my punishment,

115
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,420
that you help me with this.

116
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,890
And you've got...

117
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,790
You've got to make
your bed as well.

118
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,370
And you forgot
to wrap up the bread.

119
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,860
Two times.

120
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,900
There's no more of that.

121
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,630
You keep reading.

122
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,640
"So long, farewell,

123
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,440
auf... wiedersehen...

124
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,650
adieu, adieu, adieu,

125
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,670
to yieu and yieu and yieu."

126
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,850
"To yieu...

127
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,950
and yieu..."

128
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,560
What does that mean,

129
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,520
"yieu"?

130
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,260
It's your dumb musical.

131
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,630
"And yieu..."

132
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,320
It's German.

133
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,900
- You think?
- Mm.

134
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,440
You want
some more ketchup?

135
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,780
No.

136
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,150
Are you tired?

137
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,430
Why--why should you...

138
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,630
always ask me so...

139
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,070
so stupid questions?

140
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,430
Shall I show you
my step?

141
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,720
Oh, hi.
Hi, Gene.

142
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,520
How's the dancing?

143
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,760
Oh... good.

144
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,490
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Yeah.

145
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,830
You want to come over
to me and Bill's place

146
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,190
and listen
to some music?

147
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,430
That--that
would be lovely.

148
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,740
But... we couldn't.

149
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,670
Come on.
Come on.

150
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,210
Yeah... uh...

151
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,040
Let's go.
Come on.

152
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,290
You should ask Bill
about his money.

153
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,480
Linda likes it when
we talk about that.

154
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,860
You're doing
a very nice job with these.

155
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,300
How about that?

156
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,970
You have to be
very careful

157
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,970
not to bend
the card.

158
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,000
Uh-huh.

159
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,440
Otherwise I don't
get paid for it.

160
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,970
No.

161
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,910
That's fair,
because...

162
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,910
the people in the shops
would never want to buy it

163
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,110
if it's bent.

164
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,810
You wouldn't buy it
if it was bent.

165
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:40,820
That's true,
I wouldn't.

166
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,610
Wouldn't buy anything
if it was bent.

167
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,290
In Czechoslovakia,

168
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,530
I saw a film,

169
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:58,100
and they were eating candy
from a tin

170
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,100
just like this.

171
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,970
No.

172
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,740
I thought to myself...

173
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,840
how wonderful it must be

174
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,380
in the United States.

175
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,940
Yeah?

176
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,780
You think my house
looks like a movie?

177
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,720
Oh, our house
looks like a movie.

178
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,620
And you look
like a movie star.

179
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,120
Bill gives me
a lot of money.

180
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,460
You know?

181
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,620
I know.

182
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,490
Of course, it's all
that money you inherited,

183
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,760
isn't it, Bill?

184
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,090
That's right.

185
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,030
Hey, Selma...

186
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,700
Take the rest
with you.

187
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,410
Are you sure?

188
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,030
Go on.

189
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,120
Hello.

190
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,320
Good morning.

191
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,750
I've got the rent.

192
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,220
Oh.

193
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,260
You always pay
right on time.

194
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,760
Don't worry about Gene.
I'll get him off to school,

195
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
okay?

196
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,760
Thank you.

197
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,030
Thanks very much.

198
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,330
Remember your bag.

199
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,570
Bye-bye.

200
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,660
Bye.

201
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,140
I think you're always
so serious, Kathy.

202
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,170
Aw... again we start.

203
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,180
I don't think inside
you're serious at all.

204
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,010
I don't know.

205
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,780
Not always.

206
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,780
Cvalda.

207
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,820
Why do you
call me that?

208
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,450
It's like...
someone who's...

209
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,960
I don't know,
just big and happy.

210
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,560
I am not that big.

211
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,100
Happy?
I don't know.

212
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,160
Just need someone
to pull it out.

213
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,170
Beautiful eyes.

214
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,180
Yeah.

215
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,300
But he's not
real happy, is he?

216
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,900
How is she doing?

217
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,750
It's when she
cannot keep up,

218
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,550
and she's going to faint.

219
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,750
Ah, she fainted.

220
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,220
Please be quiet.

221
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,360
Oh, give us a break.

222
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,730
She doesn't see
that well.

223
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,490
I paid good money
to see this film.

224
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,690
Well, so did she.

225
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,900
I love it
when they dance.

226
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,740
For Pete's sake,
it's a musical.

227
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,240
Of course they're dancing!

228
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,170
We know that!

229
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,440
Oh, you're so smart.

230
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,800
- Yes.
- Oh.

231
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,970
I think you made
friends, Kathy.

232
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,520
Stop!

233
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,600
So, what'd she say?

234
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
What?

235
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,070
What did she say?

236
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,300
She didn't say
anything.

237
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,170
Are you trying to
tell me something?

238
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,340
It's about the bike.

239
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,610
The bike?

240
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,480
Mm, the bike.

241
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,910
Oh, um, l--I--

242
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,280
I cannot
give Gene a bike.

243
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,580
Is this his idea?

244
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,350
No, it's not his idea.

245
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,350
Gene?

246
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,720
Yeah?

247
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,820
Did you ask them
to come over?

248
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,460
No.

249
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,030
No, he didn't.
It doesn't...

250
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,390
He doesn't know anything,
Selma. Frankly.

251
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,330
Why, have I
done something?

252
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,530
No.

253
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,930
I haven't got
the money.

254
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:28,200
But... I'm almost
the only kid in class

255
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,760
who doesn't have
a bike.

256
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,710
I even know a boy
who's got a scooter.

257
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,940
You know I haven't got
any money.

258
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,550
The only extra money I got

259
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,550
the times I managed
to save up,

260
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,650
I send it...

261
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,850
to Grandpa.

262
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,250
- Come have a look.
- I'm not gonna get you

263
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,250
expensive things.

264
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,550
Your mother
is only teasing.

265
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,820
Look what she's
brought for you!

266
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,790
It's a bike!

267
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,860
We cannot
accept that.

268
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,590
Selma, it was second-hand.

269
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,030
I can't give him
any expensive things.

270
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,270
- Yeah, but--
- I can't even give it

271
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,700
for his birthday.

272
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,770
- Yeah, but, well--
- He's just gonna accept that.

273
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,270
I'm not that sort of mom.

274
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,740
I'm--I'm--

275
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,310
I'm just not that kind
of mother, Gene. I...

276
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,840
Can't you be

277
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,950
that kind
of a mother?

278
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,980
It's not exactly a scooter.

279
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,120
Hmm... We'll see.

280
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,450
We'll see.

281
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,550
Careful!

282
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,520
Don't ride
too fast.

283
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,980
Hey, gene,
bring it over here.

284
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,770
He looks very happy,
doesn't he?

285
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,700
He does look happy.

286
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,800
Here he comes again.

287
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,840
Attention!

288
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,200
Bring it over here.

289
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,410
Mom...

290
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,380
Okay.

291
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,340
Did you hear
what she said?

292
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,280
- She say okay?
- Yeah!

293
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,720
Did you say okay?

294
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,310
Yeah.

295
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,120
Promise to go to school.

296
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,020
Yes, yes.

297
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,690
Every day.
On time.

298
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,130
I didn't know you
were such a good biker.

299
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,460
Rust and women
are the same.

300
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,630
"Rust and women
are the same"?

301
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,370
They are the same.

302
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,600
What is it?

303
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,270
Your fat Yeah. id that?

304
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,870
Some joke...

305
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,860
I don't know
what it meant.

306
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,650
Look at that.
Oh, ho...

307
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,620
You're so kind.
Look at me.

308
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,720
He did all the work,
you know that.

309
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,750
He's really good.

310
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,920
Thank you, Jeff!

311
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,450
You're welcome.

312
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,700
Come in.

313
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,140
Something up, Bill?

314
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,800
No, no, I just couldn't
sleep, that's all.

315
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,840
I have no money.

316
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,350
All the money
that I inherited is...

317
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,050
It's gone.

318
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,220
And Linda...

319
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,560
Linda...

320
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,090
She spends and spends.

321
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,770
And my salary's
nowhere near enough.

322
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,010
I can't say no to her.

323
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,040
The bank's gonna
repossess the house...

324
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,410
because I'm so far behind
on the payments.

325
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,530
And I'm gonna lose Linda.

326
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,400
I know it.

327
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,890
I know I am.

328
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,430
She loves you, Bill.

329
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,770
Oh, don't cry.

330
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,650
I shouldn't
have told you.

331
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,720
Don't worry.

332
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,590
- Shouldn't have told you.
- It's okay.

333
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,920
Don't worry.

334
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,490
No, I think you've
got enough... stuff.

335
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,860
Would it make you
feel better

336
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,960
if I told you
a secret?

337
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,990
What secret
could you tell me?

338
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,830
I'm going blind.

339
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,120
Not yet, but...

340
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,520
Soon.

341
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,110
Maybe sometime
this year.

342
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,590
Blind...

343
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,560
It's not as bad
as it sounds.

344
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,910
It's, uh...

345
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,350
It's a family thing.

346
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,250
But, blind?

347
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,460
I've always known it.

348
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,630
From... when I was
a little girl,

349
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,620
I knew.

350
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,390
And you're okay?

351
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,470
Well, I came to America

352
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,440
because in America,

353
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,980
they can give Gene
an operation.

354
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,960
You know?

355
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,310
Gene?

356
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,680
He doesn't know
about it.

357
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,690
You... you
mustn't tell him,

358
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,220
because then
it could get worse.

359
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,360
I just have to save up
money, you know,

360
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,420
enough money to...

361
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,600
Oh, I almost got it.

362
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,570
To, uh...

363
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,830
For the operation.

364
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:03,170
They can operate on Gene
when he turns 1 3.

365
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,660
And you made up that story
about your father?

366
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,240
Huh.

367
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,150
I never had a father.

368
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,050
I made up
his name, too.

369
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,150
And that's why you
put in all these hours

370
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:21,380
and do all these pins
and do everything you do.

371
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,230
For him.

372
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,160
For his operation.

373
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,570
Well, it is my fault.

374
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,570
I guess...

375
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,660
How is it your fault?

376
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,010
Because l...
I knew he would...

377
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,710
he would have
bad eyes like me.

378
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,390
But I had him...

379
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,010
all the same.

380
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,460
You're very strong.

381
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,500
I'm not strong.

382
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,200
I've got
little games I play

383
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,860
when it goes really hard.

384
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,940
When I'm working
in the factory...

385
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,450
and the machines,
they make these...

386
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,280
rhythms...

387
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,990
And I just start dreaming,

388
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,260
and it all becomes music.

389
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,420
But you like movies,
don't you?

390
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,530
- I love the movies.
- Yeah?

391
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,560
I just love
the musicals.

392
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,100
Oh, when they're
all tap dancing?

393
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,100
All of them
tap dancing,

394
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,630
all of them, this
huge, long line.

395
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,170
I... wouldn't you
like to be

396
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,500
in that big,
long line?

397
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,470
Yeah.

398
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,710
Kicking your feet
up there?

399
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,810
Yeah.

400
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,880
When they're,
like, spiraling up

401
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,910
the huge,
enormous wedding cakes

402
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,250
to the top?

403
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,320
Yeah.

404
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,450
But isn't that annoying

405
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,690
when they do the last song
in the films, though?

406
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,850
Why?

407
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,520
Because you just know
when it goes really big,

408
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,960
and the camera goes,
like, out of the roof,

409
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,030
and you just know
it's gonna end.

410
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,030
I hate that.

411
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,300
I really hate that.

412
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,240
I used to cheat on that
when I was a little girl

413
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,500
back in Czechoslovakia.

414
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,310
I would leave the cinema

415
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,410
just after
the next to last song,

416
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,610
and the film would
just go on forever.

417
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,320
It's lovely, isn't it?

418
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,780
That is lovely.

419
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,360
Selma...

420
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,690
Yeah?

421
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,660
Thank you for
telling me your secret.

422
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,430
Thanks for
telling me yours.

423
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,040
Mum's the word, right?

424
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,610
"Mum"?

425
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,240
We don't tell anybody?

426
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,380
Oh, yes.

427
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,970
I won't tell
anyone.

428
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,350
Goodbye.

429
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,140
Goodbye.

430
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,240
Oh, thank you.

431
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,410
So, can I get you
another?

432
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,670
Yeah, sure.

433
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,340
How about a big one?

434
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,810
How many is there
in a big one?

435
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,110
1 0,000.

436
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,410
I'll have a big one.

437
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,150
What's this
guy's name again?

438
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,230
Who?

439
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,630
The old man,
your old man,

440
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,990
the guy we're carding
these pins for.

441
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,670
Her father?

442
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,300
I know.
Oldrich.

443
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,300
Right?

444
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,640
Yeah.

445
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,010
Oldrich Novy.

446
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,480
He used to dance
in Prague.

447
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,880
You commies
make a big deal

448
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,310
out of sharing
everything.

449
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,610
Yeah.

450
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,750
It's--It's
a good thing.

451
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,720
What are you doing
here if, uh...

452
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,550
Czechoslovakia's
so much better

453
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,080
than the U.S. of A?

454
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,600
No, Selma, no!

455
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,460
There are
two plates.

456
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,460
It's all right.

457
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,710
You know what happens

458
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,440
when you put two plates
in, don't you?

459
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,410
Well, she didn't do it.
I mean, it didn't happen--

460
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,570
You destroy
the tool.

461
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,480
It takes
a whole day

462
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,550
to mend.

463
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,650
Never two plates,
Selma, never!

464
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,390
You cheated the doctor.

465
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,530
You shouldn't be working
at the press at all.

466
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,030
I mean, how dare you!
Just how much can you see?

467
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,830
I could do my job
with my eyes closed.

468
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,160
So could you.

469
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,170
No.

470
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,170
It's just because
I was daydreaming.

471
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,270
Daydreaming?

472
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,370
Dreaming about what?

473
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,740
Oh, I just
hear music.

474
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,970
Come on. I mean,
Selma, music?

475
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,180
You could also
cut off your hand

476
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,740
just like that.
You have to watch out

477
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,010
every second.

478
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,980
Promise me
you'll stay awake.

479
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,880
I--I promise I will
stop daydreaming.

480
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,450
Aw, you're not--
you repeat,

481
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,750
but you don't
even listen to me.

482
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,550
I don't know why
I bother that much.

483
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,690
Hi, Selma.

484
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,030
If you're not
going with Kathy,

485
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,060
can I give you
a lift?

486
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,470
I don't want
a boyfriend.

487
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,460
I--I told you.

488
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,740
Yeah.

489
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,540
You're a really
nice guy, Jeff,

490
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,570
but...

491
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:16,240
I just don't have time
for a boyfriend.

492
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:20,250
Not right now.

493
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,750
I know.

494
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,320
If I wanted a boyfriend,
it would be you, Jeff.

495
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,980
I just don't want one
right now.

496
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,760
All right.

497
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,100
No problem, you know,

498
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,120
on the back,
to have the bike there.

499
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,760
Yeah.

500
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,540
Bye, Jeff.

501
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,150
I don't think it's
very safe, you know,

502
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:54,780
to ride a bike
wearing glasses and all.

503
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,220
- Selma?
- Bye, jeff.

504
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,710
Huh?

505
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,290
Are you okay?

506
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,250
Yeah, I'm fine.

507
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
Hello, Selm.

508
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,330
Hi, Bill.

509
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,970
Headed home?

510
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,340
Uh, yes.

511
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,240
Want to put it
in the back?

512
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,780
Oh, that would be
lovely. Yes, please.

513
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,740
Hi, Jeff.

514
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,680
Hey. Did you
see the truck?

515
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,680
No?

516
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
They're blind,

517
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,020
driving
like crazy.

518
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,050
He's what?

519
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,610
He's driving
like crazy.

520
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,830
Getting dirty.

521
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,520
That's all right.

522
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,300
Thank you.

523
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,500
Bye, Jeff.

524
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,170
Bye.

525
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,470
Thank you, Bill.

526
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:56,510
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

527
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,620
If I could just make
the next payment,

528
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,890
I'd have
a bit more time.

529
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,890
Yeah.

530
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,410
All I need is a loan.

531
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,120
It'd just be a month.

532
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,030
This money is Gene's.

533
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,910
I'm sorry, Bill.

534
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,740
That's all right.
I shouldn't have asked.

535
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,540
Oh, you had to.
Don't worry,

536
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,480
there's no harm
in asking.

537
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,680
No, no, I
shouldn't have asked.

538
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,910
Linda wants new couches.

539
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,520
I could always
shoot myself.

540
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,690
You mustn't say
things like that.

541
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:52,090
It's--
Make things easier.

542
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,870
- You know that, Bill.
- Aw, Selma.

543
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,470
You mustn't say
things like that.

544
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,940
Selma, I'm kidding.

545
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,050
Hi, Selma.
Come on in.

546
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,180
Hi, Gene.

547
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,390
Good morning.

548
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,010
Hi.

549
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,270
How are you?

550
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,600
Fine, thank you.

551
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,340
Can I see the gun?

552
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,170
Yeah, go on, sure.

553
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,250
- He's got a gun?
- Sure.

554
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,850
He's a police officer.

555
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,590
I just didn't know
he would keep it here,

556
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,720
in the house.

557
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

558
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,250
He keeps it
in his desk.

559
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,200
Maybe I should
pay more rent.

560
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,800
It's been the same

561
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,740
for the whole period
I've been here.

562
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,340
No, Selma,
I won't hear it.

563
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,240
You keep your money.
You need it more

564
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,940
than we do.

565
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,300
Two boxes?

566
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,000
Did you decide
you are going to do

567
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,900
two boxes at
the same time now?

568
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,900
Yeah.

569
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,840
Selma...
1 0:00 then?

570
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,170
1 0:00.

571
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,610
What happens
at 1 0:00?

572
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:18,710
I'm--I'm gonna do
the night shift.

573
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,310
The night shift?

574
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,550
You can hardly see
well enough

575
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,550
to do your own shift.

576
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,220
It suits me fine.

577
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,820
It's just after
drama class.

578
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,380
You are going
to do that, too?

579
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,860
I've had my fill
of you, Selma.

580
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,130
You do
what you want.

581
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,960
Go ahead,
break your neck.

582
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,200
Do your night shift,

583
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,430
but don't think
for one second

584
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,870
I'm going to come
and rescue you.

585
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,940
Selma?

586
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,950
Kathy split already.

587
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:57,050
I'm not looking
for Kathy.

588
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,080
I was looking
for you.

589
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,190
I just have to go to
drama rehearsal.

590
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,890
So what do you say?

591
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,530
You can always
ride your bike.

592
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,460
You have it over there.

593
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,900
I left it at home.

594
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,470
I thought it'd be
quicker if I walked.

595
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,740
How do you reckon that?

596
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,140
I just walk along
the railroad tracks.

597
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,810
It's a...

598
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,140
shortcut.

599
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,400
Look, I don't understand.
In musicals...

600
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,960
why do they start to sing
and dance all of a sudden?

601
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:58,450
I mean, I don't suddenly
start... to sing and dance.

602
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,410
No...

603
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,250
You're right, Jeff.
You don't.

604
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:08,520
The last thing on the list
is the bake sale.

605
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,390
Two sundays away.

606
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:15,130
Hi, Selma.
Come on in, come on in.

607
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,660
I'm gonna introduce you
to your understudy.

608
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,470
My understudy?

609
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,470
Yeah.

610
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,900
This girl Suzan,
who boris knows,

611
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,810
is a good singer.
She's a good dancer.

612
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,440
She'll learn
your part, too,

613
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,440
because, say,
you get a cold,

614
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,210
and...

615
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,280
you can't do it,

616
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,380
then the show
doesn't have to stop.

617
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,380
Okay?

618
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,580
Suzan, Selma.
Selma, Suzan.

619
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,390
Could you take off
your glasses?

620
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,400
I think
we'll do the part

621
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,970
without glasses.

622
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,540
Next sunday,
you will see

623
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,270
both Marias.

624
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,140
I mean, Selma will
do the role, really,

625
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,540
but... i'll have you
read part of it too.

626
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,570
All right?

627
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,750
It's your first time
on the night shift,

628
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,750
right?

629
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,520
While this
is being pressed,

630
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,950
you'll be cutting
on the other machine.

631
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,250
That means
you'll be in charge

632
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,220
of two machines.

633
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:20,130
You have to beat Sarah
over there, right?

634
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,060
This pallet must
never be empty.

635
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,160
Is it always
so dark in here?

636
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,170
What?

637
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,430
Is it always
so dark in here?

638
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,130
It's exactly the same
as the daytime.

639
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,300
Oh.
Okay.

640
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,240
The only thing is you have
to work a little faster.

641
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,440
That's what
you're paid for, right?

642
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,540
- Okay.
- Okay?

643
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,530
Thank you.

644
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,100
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

645
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,230
You have to work
a little, you know,

646
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,600
a little faster
than this.

647
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,690
Okay.

648
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,360
What are you
doing here?

649
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,730
What do you think?

650
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,370
I didn't put you down for
the night shift, Kathy.

651
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,870
Run along, Norman.

652
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,980
I'm on my own time now.

653
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,150
How I spend it
is my own business.

654
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,810
'Night, ladies!

655
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:47,840
Good night!

656
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,650
Faster.

657
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,020
A little faster.

658
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,560
I like it better
when you dance.

659
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,090
You should dance
more... Cvalda.

660
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,860
I will dance
when there is music.

661
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,700
It's music.

662
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,360
Now dance.

663
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:28,620
Selma!

664
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:30,960
Stop that,
you've cut yourself!

665
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,600
Get away from
the machine!

666
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,900
Henry!

667
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:44,080
Oh, Jeff is here.

668
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,480
Hello, Jeff.

669
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,650
Hi, Kathy.

670
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,310
Do you live here?

671
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,420
Thought she might
say yes to a ride

672
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,290
when it's
this late.

673
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:58,220
M-maybe Kathy...

674
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,760
wants a ride.

675
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,690
No, it's all right.

676
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,700
What's that,
with your hand?

677
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,530
She cut her...

678
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:07,870
Cut my finger.

679
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,940
Yeah. It's going
to be all right.

680
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,440
The plates are sharp.

681
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,440
Goodnight.

682
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,430
Careful.

683
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:16,590
I think I found
a solution to our problem.

684
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,910
That makes me
really happy.

685
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:24,910
It's nothing special...

686
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:27,150
But I've made up my mind.
I'm gonna tell Linda,

687
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:28,700
and, uh...

688
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:35,780
I mean, after all,
she loves me, and...

689
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,060
We'll just
work it out together.

690
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,000
That sounds like
a really good idea, Bill.

691
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,480
I'm sorry, I'll
let you get to bed.

692
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,140
I guess I'm kinda tired.

693
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:00,850
Thanks, Bill.

694
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:02,080
Good night, Selma.

695
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,410
Good night, Bill.

696
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:15,730
Bill?

697
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,610
What's happening now?

698
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,370
Here we go.
Selma, are you ready?

699
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,820
And...

700
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:17,780
You're on.

701
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,760
Cut. Cut, stop.

702
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,890
Stop, please.

703
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:29,130
This is Selma's entrance, okay?

704
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:30,760
Yeah?

705
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,700
Okay, Paul, please.

706
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:39,040
How far
do you think it is?

707
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,630
I don't know.

708
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:47,370
And...

709
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:52,950
Kathy, what
are you doing?

710
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:54,950
This is
Maria's entrance.

711
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:56,460
Yes.
I'm sorry.

712
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,720
My mistake.

713
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,860
Please, please!

714
00:48:58,860 --> 00:48:59,930
I don't have
all night!

715
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:00,990
Six steps.

716
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:02,930
Let's take this
a little more seriously.

717
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:14,170
Good!

718
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:16,640
Okay, I'm thinking
maybe, Selma...

719
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,250
You could take a little
sort of circle around Boris

720
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,810
on this next part,

721
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:24,250
unless you have something else
you wanna suggest.

722
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,690
I'm open.

723
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:28,590
Okay?

724
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,960
Samuel.

725
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,890
Yes?

726
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:33,230
I need to
talk to you.

727
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:35,830
Oh, Selma, please, if
it's about the drummer,

728
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,500
I have been looking
everywhere for a drummer--

729
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,600
It's not
about the drummer.

730
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,090
It's not
about the drummer.

731
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:48,070
Um... just a quick word.

732
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:49,910
Do you wanna
go outside?

733
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:50,980
Yup.

734
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,100
Okay.

735
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,760
I--I'm not
gonna play Maria.

736
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,620
What?

737
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,160
My heart just
isn't in this...

738
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,570
Like, I shouldn't
be wasting my time

739
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:14,030
on something...

740
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:16,930
that isn't...
that important really.

741
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:23,010
I've been watching Suzan,
and she's...

742
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:24,080
She's great.

743
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,680
She's... She's very--

744
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,550
She's a much better dancer
than I am.

745
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:29,550
Terrific.

746
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:32,520
Suzan's terrific.
I'm not denying that,

747
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,350
but you--I thought
you lived for musicals.

748
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:37,790
So you've been pretending
the whole time?

749
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:39,860
Yes.

750
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,760
I've just been pretending.

751
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,760
I don't know what else
I could do with you.

752
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,170
I've got everything
cast right now.

753
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:48,130
Yeah.

754
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:50,640
The only part that's left
is the old nun

755
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,040
who lets maria out
of the convent gate.

756
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,340
I don't think
you'd want that part.

757
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,680
There's no dancing
in that.

758
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,510
She's
quite serious then?

759
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:00,980
She's serious.

760
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,050
It's important
for the part.

761
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,950
Okay. I'm not
dancing really.

762
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,890
No.

763
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:10,960
I could put a little bit
of dancing in there.

764
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,490
You think so?

765
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:16,060
It--I didn't
have it in mind.

766
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,860
You can have
your tapping.

767
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:21,800
She could be just
a little... humorous

768
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,470
once in a while...

769
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:25,100
even though
she's a nun.

770
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:30,230
You'll always be
my perfect Maria.

771
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:35,850
Where are all
the hairpins today?

772
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,620
I left them at home.

773
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:40,320
And she won't be
playing Maria.

774
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,320
What do you reckon
I'm gonna do

775
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,760
if I can't bawl you out
for learning your lines

776
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,950
on company time?

777
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:48,260
One...two...

778
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,490
Three!

779
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,400
What kind of a joke
is that?

780
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,300
Well, she's beating me.

781
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,500
I need a word with you.

782
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,110
We're talking
right now.

783
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:00,870
All right...

784
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:02,240
Come on.

785
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,180
Please sit down.

786
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,920
We were off
for the whole day.

787
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,930
Everything stops when
the machine breaks.

788
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,150
You know that.

789
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:25,970
I--I can do my job
just fine...

790
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:29,340
if I stick
to the day shift.

791
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:31,540
This won't happen again.

792
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,940
Look, I daydream
too much.

793
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,740
I--I decided to quit.

794
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:41,040
And...

795
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:45,680
And I guess,
then l--I forgot.

796
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:51,290
I've been ordered
to let you go, Selma.

797
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,200
You're not
gonna have to pay

798
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,730
for the machine
you broke.

799
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,070
I got them
to agree to that.

800
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:05,660
Uh, thanks, Norman.

801
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,640
This is your salary.

802
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:18,580
And you know, um...

803
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,790
Maybe we can find you
something

804
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:23,620
away from the machines

805
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,790
where your eyesight
wouldn't matter so much.

806
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:26,690
Yeah...

807
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:28,490
Not right away.

808
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:30,260
That's very kind
of you.

809
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,530
I better go.

810
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:34,900
I'll be okay.
I really will.

811
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,770
Thanks, Norman.

812
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:38,500
Thank you, Selma.

813
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,490
Thank you.

814
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,530
What is she
going to do now?

815
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:01,360
Did you ever think
about that?

816
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,970
Don't worry, Kathy.
Really.

817
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:08,520
I'm gonna be fine.

818
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:12,910
Has anybody
seen Jeff today?

819
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:14,970
He's usually here
early, Selma,

820
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:16,840
but not this early.

821
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,170
It's a shame.

822
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:29,680
Selma!

823
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:33,850
Selma...

824
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,070
I could give you
a lift if you want.

825
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:42,570
I--I will need a lift...

826
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,570
Later.

827
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:47,240
I need to do
something important

828
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,470
at...at 3:00.

829
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:53,910
Well, you need to get
your truck then, don't you?

830
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:55,910
Yeah.

831
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:07,560
Train's coming.
Get off the track, Jeff.

832
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,200
You have to be careful.

833
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,790
Stay to the side.

834
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,700
You can't see,
can you?

835
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:40,920
What is there to see?

836
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:43,020
You can't see,
can you?

837
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:46,960
See you at 3:00.

838
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,500
I can see.

839
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:53,030
Gene hasn't
come back yet.

840
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:58,600
I need to talk to Bill.

841
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,140
He decided to
take the day off

842
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,270
to go to the bank
for his box.

843
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:05,940
Is he--is he upstairs?

844
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:06,930
Yeah.

845
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:11,680
I know everything, Selma.

846
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,050
Bill told me.

847
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:15,520
I want you to move out!

848
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,390
I--I don't understand.

849
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:24,690
Wh-what would you know?

850
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:29,700
That you came on
to him.

851
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:32,100
That you asked him
into the trailer,

852
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,870
but he
turned you down!

853
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:41,980
You've got nothing
to say for yourself?

854
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:45,620
No.

855
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:47,450
I want to talk to Bill.

856
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,100
Hi, Bill.

857
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,000
Linda saw me go up
to the, um...

858
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:19,350
Up to the trailer.

859
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:24,720
I told her it was you
who wanted to, uh...

860
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,460
That you'd...

861
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:29,330
That you'd fallen
in love with me.

862
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:33,730
I know.
She told me.

863
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:35,630
And what did
you tell her?

864
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:37,500
Nothing.

865
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,670
You didn't tell her
I was lying?

866
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:43,000
Mum's the word, right?

867
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:52,850
Linda told me
you went to the bank.

868
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:57,050
I went to the bank
to ask for more time.

869
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:03,030
But I couldn't do it.

870
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:06,360
And I brought the box
home instead.

871
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:08,870
Linda always
gets so proud

872
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:11,430
when she sees me
sitting in here with it.

873
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,770
But you have put
my money in it,

874
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,140
haven't you?

875
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:22,340
To make it look
like it's yours.

876
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:36,940
I'm gonna have to take it.

877
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:38,660
Well, you
can have it back.

878
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:42,910
No, you can have it.

879
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:43,910
Bill...

880
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:47,040
You can have it back
in a month.

881
01:04:50,830 --> 01:04:53,000
But--but I can't
do that, Bill.

882
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Selma.

883
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,070
I--I've decided to...

884
01:04:57,070 --> 01:04:58,840
to pay the doctor

885
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,480
this afternoon.

886
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,980
I can't save up more money.

887
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:05,810
That's over now.

888
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,590
Gene doesn't
even turn 1 3

889
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:15,960
until after christmas.

890
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:19,530
It was $2,026

891
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:21,860
and 1 0 cents

892
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,190
in the tin.

893
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,730
I can't count it now,
but I trust you.

894
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:31,810
And it's...

895
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:34,300
$30 I got today...

896
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:37,250
which makes it

897
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:41,310
2,056...

898
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,890
and 1 0 cents.

899
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:46,050
It's not enough.

900
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:48,720
But it'll have to do.

901
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,260
Selma...

902
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,820
- Bye, Bill.
- Selma...

903
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,070
Selma, stop.

904
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,830
I'm pointing my gun
at you, Selma.

905
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:13,580
I don't believe you.

906
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:15,880
You're just trying
to scare me.

907
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,910
I can't see a gun.

908
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:20,590
Selma...

909
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:22,420
Just... feel this.
Feel this.

910
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,520
Just feel it!
Feel it!

911
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,060
Do you believe
I have the gun?

912
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:31,500
I believe you.

913
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,770
But it's my money.

914
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:34,700
No, it's my money.

915
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:37,040
It's the money
I had in my box.

916
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,070
And you're trying
to steal it from me.

917
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:41,080
Selma?

918
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,180
Selma!
Selma, stop!

919
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:45,110
Selma, stop!
Linda!

920
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:46,650
- No!
- Linda! Linda!

921
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:48,810
What's the matter,
Bill?

922
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,340
She tried to
steal the money.

923
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:56,760
She knew I had
the gun in my...

924
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,390
in my drawer
and she--

925
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:59,730
Is that why
you wanted him,

926
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:01,130
for the money?

927
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:03,230
Go out to the car
and get my handcuffs.

928
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,390
Go get the handcuffs.

929
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:10,340
Give me the money.

930
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:12,370
Give me the money.

931
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:15,310
Give me the money
and i'll let you go.

932
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:16,710
No.

933
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:18,110
No.

934
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:19,410
Where should I go?

935
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,280
Just give me
the money.

936
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,350
Selma.

937
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:26,490
Just give me
the money!

938
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:27,560
The money.

939
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,960
Give me the money!

940
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,060
No!

941
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:30,860
No!

942
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:32,380
- Get--
- No!

943
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:37,000
Bill!
Oh, Bill!

944
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,070
You shot me.

945
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:51,150
No, no, Selma.

946
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,780
You did the right thing.

947
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:55,380
I should've done it
myself.

948
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,950
Kill me.

949
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,360
Just kill me.

950
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,470
Will you just be
my friend...

951
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:14,000
and show some mercy,
please, and just...

952
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,070
kill me?

953
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:17,770
Your handcuffs aren't
in the car, Bill.

954
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:19,470
Just show
some mercy, Selma,

955
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:20,840
and just...

956
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:26,980
Linda, run.

957
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:29,320
Run up to Miller's farm.
Just run up to Miller's farm

958
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:31,920
and call the station.
Tell them to hurry.

959
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,820
Run! Get up there!
Go on to Miller's farm!

960
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:39,720
If you want
the money...

961
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:47,640
you're gonna have
to kill me.

962
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,200
Don't do this to me.

963
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,410
Don't do this
to me.

964
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:05,880
I'm not letting go.

965
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,030
No.

966
01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:11,930
Selma, shoot me!

967
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:14,100
Just shoot me!
Shoot me! Shoot me!

968
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,790
Shoot me!!

969
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,010
Cant't you
just stand up

970
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:35,680
and pull
the goddamn trigger!

971
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:58,740
I'll have to
take the money.

972
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:04,970
Forgive me.

973
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:43,930
Selma?

974
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:51,090
Jeff.

975
01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:00,450
What are you
doing here?

976
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:07,080
Is it already 3:00?

977
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,160
Uh, not really.

978
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,990
Hell, I'm always early.

979
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:24,210
You cut yourself again.

980
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:26,970
There's some blood
on your blouse.

981
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:30,140
Strange.

982
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,340
I couldn't feel it
at all.

983
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:10,440
Selma...

984
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,910
We're here now.

985
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,390
By the bus stop?

986
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:26,570
Yeah, the bus stop.

987
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:29,640
It's over there.

988
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,470
And the lake
is here?

989
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:35,280
Promise me
that you won't follow me.

990
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,340
Promise.

991
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:43,650
Yeah, I promise.

992
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:32,490
Dobry Vecer,
Pane Doktore.

993
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:34,230
Dobry Vecer.

994
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:36,920
I would like to pay
for the operation now.

995
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:41,970
$2,056...

996
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:45,370
and 1 0 cents.

997
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:47,710
I know it's not quite

998
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:50,750
what you told me, but...

999
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:52,650
but it's all
I could get together.

1000
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:54,410
Well.

1001
01:22:58,190 --> 01:22:59,990
What last name

1002
01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:01,620
shall I put
on the receipt?

1003
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:04,690
Oh, I don't need
a receipt.

1004
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:07,230
I really don't.

1005
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:09,130
I have to know
the name of your son.

1006
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:11,330
When he comes in
for his operation.

1007
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,760
Novy...

1008
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:18,770
He will come,

1009
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:21,740
and he will say
that his name is Novy.

1010
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:26,210
And then
you will know...

1011
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,150
that he has
been paid for.

1012
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:30,550
Novy?

1013
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:33,790
Like Oldrich Novy,

1014
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:35,560
the tap dancer?

1015
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,490
It is strange,
isn't it?

1016
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:39,190
But he never really
made it over here,

1017
01:23:39,190 --> 01:23:40,930
did he?

1018
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:44,900
I saw his films
when I was a kid.

1019
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:47,200
He was in
the first musical

1020
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,370
I ever saw.

1021
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:51,270
Same here.

1022
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,540
Selma?

1023
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:15,450
It's Tuesday night.

1024
01:24:18,430 --> 01:24:20,160
What about
your rehearsal?

1025
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,700
Yeah, I guess.

1026
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:28,440
You want to go?

1027
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,240
Yeah.

1028
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:31,950
Then maybe put
your arm around her,

1029
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:33,810
and... a little bit of...

1030
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:37,180
Hi, Selma.

1031
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:39,490
Hi, Samuel.

1032
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:42,010
We weren't sure you'd
show up, actually.

1033
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:44,660
Sure, I'd show up.

1034
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:47,830
Hi.

1035
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:49,530
Nice to see you.

1036
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:50,230
Be right back.

1037
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:51,630
Okay.

1038
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:08,750
She's here.

1039
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:09,750
Yeah.

1040
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:11,340
Okay.

1041
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,510
Okay.

1042
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:20,360
Okay, I think--I
think you could...

1043
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:23,460
try it one more time
for me.

1044
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:26,170
But I should--
I should be going now.

1045
01:25:26,170 --> 01:25:28,600
I think Gene may wonder
where I am.

1046
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,910
Jeff, he--he hasn't
seen me all day.

1047
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:35,010
I think maybe we
could do your scene.

1048
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:36,910
Let's do
the tapping scene.

1049
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:39,380
Okay? We haven't
done it in weeks,

1050
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:40,820
and we really need
to rehearse it,

1051
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:41,980
and while you're here,
we might as well

1052
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:44,990
take advantage
of the time, please?

1053
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:46,450
Okay, let's do
the tapping scene.

1054
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:47,590
You come offstage--

1055
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:48,960
Let me have
the nuns up there.

1056
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,360
Imagi--
you're going to do

1057
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:51,360
Selma's part
for her

1058
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:52,720
for right now,
all right?

1059
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:58,370
You like it?

1060
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:00,600
Yes.

1061
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,540
We haven't done it
for a while.

1062
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,700
Remember that part
we did where--

1063
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:31,230
where you, uh...

1064
01:26:31,230 --> 01:26:33,370
you come to
the convent gate

1065
01:26:33,370 --> 01:26:35,570
to say goodbye
to the--to Maria?

1066
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:37,570
I should leave, Jeff.

1067
01:26:37,570 --> 01:26:38,640
What?

1068
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,610
Gene--Gene is
probably worried now.

1069
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:42,810
I haven't seen him
all day.

1070
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:44,140
All right.

1071
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:48,780
I'm sorry, Samuel, but...

1072
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:50,620
Betty, come here
for a second, please.

1073
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:51,720
The drummer
that you wanted--

1074
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,290
Remember, you asked
me for a drummer?

1075
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:55,220
I found somebody.
She's fantastic.

1076
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:56,620
Her name's Betty.
She's right here

1077
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:57,760
for the first time
tonight.

1078
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,690
Please meet her.
Selma, this is Betty.

1079
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:01,930
Hi, Betty.

1080
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:04,930
You play the drums?

1081
01:27:04,930 --> 01:27:06,000
Yeah.

1082
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,570
Tell her how long
you've been studying.

1083
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:08,940
Two years.

1084
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:10,700
She's wonderful.

1085
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:12,170
You've got to stay
and enjoy this.

1086
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:14,070
You've got to--
I have an idea.

1087
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:16,340
Let's do the finale.

1088
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:19,380
I just remembered,
you hate finales.

1089
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:20,980
No finale!

1090
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:23,350
I've a better idea.

1091
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:25,280
"Climb Every Mountain,"
part one.

1092
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:28,510
The state will show

1093
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:31,250
that the defendant
has not only perpetrated

1094
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:33,350
the most callous...

1095
01:29:33,350 --> 01:29:36,320
and well-planned homicide
in recent memory...

1096
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:41,090
but is also
a fundamentally selfish

1097
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:43,390
individual...

1098
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:45,430
who cynically hides

1099
01:29:45,430 --> 01:29:47,330
behind a handicap,

1100
01:29:47,330 --> 01:29:49,600
devoid of sympathy
for anybody

1101
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,060
but herself.

1102
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:55,840
This woman found
trust and friendship

1103
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,710
when she sought refuge
in our country,

1104
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:01,410
and the evidence will show

1105
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:04,550
that she has repaid
such kindness with betrayal,

1106
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:06,350
robbery, and murder,

1107
01:30:06,350 --> 01:30:08,820
inflicted upon
the very people

1108
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:11,840
who opened their homes
and hearts to her.

1109
01:30:14,050 --> 01:30:15,780
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

1110
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:19,630
The evidence will prove
that she herself...

1111
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:23,080
did not show that mercy
she will ask of us.

1112
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:27,370
Is this the bag here,
detective?

1113
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:32,110
Yes,
the very same.

1114
01:30:32,110 --> 01:30:34,340
Houston's blood
was all over it.

1115
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:37,180
Well, shortly
before the homicide,

1116
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:39,680
I had a checkup
on her vision,

1117
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:43,620
and I found
that she was myopic.

1118
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:44,820
It's nearsighted--

1119
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:47,380
Nearsighted, but...
She could see.

1120
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:49,380
Yes.

1121
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,690
She said communism was...

1122
01:30:52,690 --> 01:30:54,680
better for human beings.

1123
01:30:56,630 --> 01:30:58,070
She had nothing
but contempt

1124
01:30:58,070 --> 01:31:00,200
for our great country
and its principles?

1125
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,970
Apart from its musicals.
She said the American one...

1126
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:04,570
the American ones
were better.

1127
01:31:04,570 --> 01:31:06,470
So...

1128
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:08,640
the defendant
preferred Hollywood

1129
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:10,200
to Vladivostok.

1130
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:14,080
I suppose that's
an acknowledgement of sorts.

1131
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,480
She just asked
many times

1132
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:17,480
about the money.

1133
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:19,590
She wanted to know
where it was?

1134
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:20,890
That's right.

1135
01:31:20,890 --> 01:31:22,960
She asked you
about the gun?

1136
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,730
Yes, she did.

1137
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:27,190
She wanted to know
where it was kept?

1138
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:29,160
That's right.

1139
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,730
Bill was lying on the floor

1140
01:31:30,730 --> 01:31:33,630
and... he was wounded.

1141
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:36,040
And...

1142
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:38,140
And...

1143
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:40,740
He was pleading for his life?

1144
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:41,710
Yes.

1145
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:44,140
"I--I beg you,
I beg you,

1146
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:45,280
I beg you."

1147
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,650
You showed him
no mercy, Selma!

1148
01:31:54,350 --> 01:31:57,690
You shall have
no mercy either!

1149
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:02,790
Would you state your name
for the record, please?

1150
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:08,060
Selma Jezkova.

1151
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:13,110
And Bill and
Linda Houston...

1152
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:15,040
were your friends,
is that right?

1153
01:32:18,650 --> 01:32:19,650
Yeah.

1154
01:32:19,650 --> 01:32:21,550
In fact, you lived
in a trailer

1155
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:23,520
on their property.

1156
01:32:27,390 --> 01:32:28,860
Yeah.

1157
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:30,760
And didn't they also

1158
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:32,430
take care
of your young son

1159
01:32:32,430 --> 01:32:34,220
when you were at work?

1160
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:40,320
Yeah.

1161
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:43,670
They bought him a...

1162
01:32:43,670 --> 01:32:46,310
birthday present
recently.

1163
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:47,640
Is that right?

1164
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:54,240
Yeah. They
got him a bike.

1165
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:59,190
Right.

1166
01:32:59,190 --> 01:33:01,790
Your sight
was poor,

1167
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:03,890
you claim,
contrary to

1168
01:33:03,890 --> 01:33:06,380
the expert testimony
we have received.

1169
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:10,530
But you saw
well enough

1170
01:33:10,530 --> 01:33:14,090
to inflict 34 wounds
on Bill Houston.

1171
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:18,260
So why did you
kill him, actually?

1172
01:33:19,710 --> 01:33:21,730
If I may be
so bold to ask?

1173
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:29,910
He asked me to.

1174
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:33,090
He did?

1175
01:33:33,090 --> 01:33:34,660
How intriguing.

1176
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:36,420
A man with
a fine career

1177
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:39,260
and some wealth,
a happy marriage,

1178
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:41,230
why would
this Bill Houston

1179
01:33:41,230 --> 01:33:42,750
ask you to kill him?

1180
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,540
I promised not to say.

1181
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:53,740
Well, that clears
things up immensely.

1182
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:56,680
You promised
you wouldn't say.

1183
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:59,450
In that case, we'll just
have to take your word for it

1184
01:33:59,450 --> 01:34:02,150
when you say
that the money you stole

1185
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:04,820
that Bill Houston's savings

1186
01:34:04,820 --> 01:34:06,950
also disappeared
so mysteriously

1187
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:08,460
that same day.

1188
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:10,720
Just, uh...

1189
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,920
Just where did you
get your money?

1190
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:18,360
Well...

1191
01:34:20,030 --> 01:34:22,440
I'd been saving up.

1192
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:26,210
Well, I suppose
you could call it that.

1193
01:34:26,210 --> 01:34:28,610
What were these savings
to be used for?

1194
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:30,380
You never bought your son

1195
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:32,310
so much as
a single birthday present,

1196
01:34:32,310 --> 01:34:34,110
as we've heard.

1197
01:34:38,050 --> 01:34:39,310
Yes?

1198
01:34:41,150 --> 01:34:43,420
My--my father.

1199
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:46,050
In Czechoslovakia.

1200
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:51,650
Your father?

1201
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,340
And what,
pray tell...

1202
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:56,770
is his name?

1203
01:35:01,310 --> 01:35:03,370
My--my father is...

1204
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:08,680
Oldrich Novy.

1205
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:09,810
So...

1206
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:12,990
We're meant to believe...

1207
01:35:12,990 --> 01:35:14,890
that you killed
Bill Houston

1208
01:35:14,890 --> 01:35:16,820
by inflicting
34 wounds on him

1209
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:19,430
because...

1210
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:21,400
He asked you to.

1211
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:24,160
Just as we're meant
to believe

1212
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,100
that you were blind
when you did it...

1213
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:30,240
Are meant to believe
that it was your own savings

1214
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:32,070
that you stole from him...

1215
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:33,540
Just as we're meant
to believe

1216
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:35,680
that you sent all you had

1217
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,540
to your father back home,

1218
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:40,510
a man by the name
of Oldrich Novy.

1219
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:42,950
Is that right?

1220
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:49,010
Yes.

1221
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:53,220
Thank you,
Miss Jezkova.

1222
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:03,640
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

1223
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:06,540
you've now heard from
the defendant's own lips.

1224
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:08,540
You must believe her,

1225
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:11,080
just as you
must believe her

1226
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:13,350
when she claims
her father's name

1227
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:15,580
is Oldrich Novy.

1228
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:18,690
Your Honor...

1229
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:19,990
at this time,
the state calls

1230
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:21,650
to the witness stand...

1231
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:24,890
Oldrich Novy.

1232
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,070
Please state
your full name.

1233
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:39,570
The name is
Oldrich Novy.

1234
01:36:39,570 --> 01:36:43,270
And you used to live
in Czechoslovakia?

1235
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:45,680
That is right.

1236
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,180
I live now in California,
as you know.

1237
01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:50,450
That's right, that's
where we found you.

1238
01:36:50,450 --> 01:36:53,650
What exactly is
your relationship

1239
01:36:53,650 --> 01:36:55,480
with the defendant?

1240
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,760
I do not know her.

1241
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,100
You don't know her?

1242
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:06,370
So...

1243
01:37:06,370 --> 01:37:08,940
You have not received money

1244
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:10,440
from her.

1245
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:11,870
Money that--that...

1246
01:37:11,870 --> 01:37:14,310
she says was so dearly earned?

1247
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:17,010
No, I have not.

1248
01:37:17,010 --> 01:37:19,040
Perhaps you're
not her father then?

1249
01:37:20,310 --> 01:37:21,880
No, I am not.

1250
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:23,520
Well, if
this relationship

1251
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:26,590
was made up
by the defendant,

1252
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:27,890
then...

1253
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:28,960
can you think
of any way

1254
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,530
she might've come
to know your name?

1255
01:37:31,530 --> 01:37:35,160
I was once well known
in Czechoslovakia

1256
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:37,900
uh... because of my profession.

1257
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:40,870
Yes, Mr. Oldrich Novy,
what is your profession?

1258
01:37:40,870 --> 01:37:42,870
Maybe that can give us
a clue to why,

1259
01:37:42,870 --> 01:37:45,340
why this somewhat...
romantic,

1260
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:47,510
certainly communistic, woman

1261
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:50,480
who worships Fred Astaire
but not his country,

1262
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:52,480
why she might've lied...

1263
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,650
and misused your name...

1264
01:37:54,650 --> 01:37:57,880
to make us think
all her money was spent

1265
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:01,290
on a poor father
and not on her own vanity.

1266
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:02,460
What is it that you do?

1267
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:05,660
I was an actor.
I made films.

1268
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:07,960
They were musicals.

1269
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:56,500
Say it again!

1270
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:21,120
Will the court please rise?

1271
01:41:23,190 --> 01:41:26,280
The honorable Judge
A.D. Mantle presiding.

1272
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,560
Have you reached a verdict?

1273
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:42,570
Yes, Your Honor.

1274
01:42:01,860 --> 01:42:04,690
Will the defendant
please rise?

1275
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:17,110
We, the jury,
find the defendant

1276
01:42:17,110 --> 01:42:19,150
Selma Jezkova

1277
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:21,080
guilty of murder
in the first degree

1278
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:24,150
and hereby sentence her
to death.

1279
01:42:24,150 --> 01:42:26,890
Is this
the verdict of this jury?

1280
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:30,560
You fully understand
that it must be unanimous?

1281
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,960
We do, Your Honor.

1282
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:35,400
Selma Jezkova...

1283
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,800
You are hereby sentenced

1284
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:39,900
to be taken from this place

1285
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:42,400
and confined in
the state penitentiary

1286
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:45,710
until such time
as you shall be executed

1287
01:42:45,710 --> 01:42:48,470
by being hanged
by the neck

1288
01:42:48,470 --> 01:42:50,140
until you are dead.

1289
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:51,810
This court is adjourned.

1290
01:42:51,810 --> 01:42:53,340
All rise!

1291
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:13,670
I've just heard
about the...

1292
01:43:13,670 --> 01:43:16,270
Supreme Court decision.

1293
01:43:16,270 --> 01:43:18,000
Yeah, l...

1294
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,840
I just want to talk
practical stuff.

1295
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:27,480
On Gene's birthday...

1296
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:33,150
he will receive
a letter.

1297
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:35,390
And it's so important,
Kathy...

1298
01:43:35,390 --> 01:43:38,320
that he reads it
really carefully.

1299
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:41,560
I need you to take care
of that for me...

1300
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:43,630
because I'm not
gonna be there

1301
01:43:43,630 --> 01:43:45,700
when he gets it.

1302
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:47,230
He should not be afraid,

1303
01:43:47,230 --> 01:43:50,000
because there's nothing
to be afraid of, Kathy.

1304
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:54,010
Listen, Gene wants
to see you so badly.

1305
01:43:54,010 --> 01:43:56,530
Won't you let him?
Please?

1306
01:44:00,210 --> 01:44:02,110
There's nothing
for him to see.

1307
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:06,580
He's got you now,
Kathy.

1308
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:12,330
And there's
one more thing:

1309
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:15,060
He has to
call himself Novy.

1310
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:16,930
That's
very important.

1311
01:44:16,930 --> 01:44:19,600
All right,
time's up, Selma.

1312
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,570
I know that sounds
a bit foolish.

1313
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:23,570
Novy?

1314
01:44:23,570 --> 01:44:24,970
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you before

1315
01:44:24,970 --> 01:44:27,010
about all this.
I just didn't dare to

1316
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:29,840
because they would
ruin everything.

1317
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,210
But what--
Why does he

1318
01:44:31,210 --> 01:44:32,950
have to call himself Novy?

1319
01:44:32,950 --> 01:44:35,050
Stop asking questions
like that, Cvalda.

1320
01:44:35,050 --> 01:44:37,980
Please... Iet me
tell Gene hello...

1321
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:39,280
from you to him.

1322
01:44:41,050 --> 01:44:42,420
No.

1323
01:45:02,180 --> 01:45:03,940
I know you love
your son very much.

1324
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:07,680
I love him very much.

1325
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:13,850
Got a boy of my own
back home.

1326
01:45:19,330 --> 01:45:21,820
You never told me that.

1327
01:45:27,570 --> 01:45:28,870
Good night, Brenda.

1328
01:45:28,870 --> 01:45:30,070
Good night.

1329
01:45:30,070 --> 01:45:32,000
Say hi to your son
from me.

1330
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:35,840
Thank you, Selma.

1331
01:46:33,430 --> 01:46:34,830
Can I help you?

1332
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:38,170
Did you once have
a patient called...

1333
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:41,110
Jezkova...

1334
01:46:41,110 --> 01:46:44,580
Selma Jezkova?

1335
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:46,050
Well, if it wasn't
too long ago,

1336
01:46:46,050 --> 01:46:47,950
I can check
my records for you.

1337
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:52,650
Jes... Jez... Jess...

1338
01:46:53,650 --> 01:46:55,750
Sorry, there's no one
here by that name.

1339
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:04,190
What about Novy?

1340
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:08,130
I have good news for you.

1341
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,300
What's that?

1342
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:10,500
We found a new lawyer...

1343
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:13,840
and he's going to get
your case re-opened.

1344
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:16,600
He says your lawyer
was incompetent.

1345
01:47:19,010 --> 01:47:20,380
What do you mean?

1346
01:47:22,580 --> 01:47:24,710
Well, the case is
going to be re-opened.

1347
01:47:26,250 --> 01:47:28,050
You won't get
the death sentence.

1348
01:47:30,290 --> 01:47:31,920
Is that true?

1349
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:34,620
Yes. New information
has turned up.

1350
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,360
Wh-what information?

1351
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,400
Well, we know
the whole story, Selma.

1352
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:42,140
Why didn't you tell us
anything?

1353
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:43,840
You know, about...

1354
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:46,000
about the money
for Gene's operation.

1355
01:47:49,510 --> 01:47:51,780
How did you find out?

1356
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:53,710
Well, Jeff talked
to the doctor.

1357
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:57,940
Does--does Gene know?

1358
01:48:00,490 --> 01:48:01,950
I mean,
have you told Gene?

1359
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:05,590
No.
No, I didn't.

1360
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:07,790
But you've got
a much better case now.

1361
01:48:07,790 --> 01:48:09,890
That's very important,
Kathy.

1362
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:14,730
His eyes might get
worse from worrying,

1363
01:48:14,730 --> 01:48:16,730
and then the operation
won't work.

1364
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:19,610
Yes, but, Selma...

1365
01:48:19,610 --> 01:48:21,540
Don't you see
that it would help you

1366
01:48:21,540 --> 01:48:23,980
if they knew that you
were trying to save your son

1367
01:48:23,980 --> 01:48:25,310
from going blind?

1368
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:28,210
The lawyer,
he'll come and see you

1369
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:30,350
in two weeks' time.

1370
01:48:30,350 --> 01:48:31,380
Kathy, but, uh...

1371
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:33,190
You know
they're hanging me

1372
01:48:33,190 --> 01:48:34,190
in one week.

1373
01:48:34,190 --> 01:48:35,560
We know that,
but he says

1374
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:37,220
you can apply for a stay.

1375
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:39,660
You know, most cases
get one the first time.

1376
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:45,020
Well, you can smile.

1377
01:48:46,430 --> 01:48:48,130
Selma...

1378
01:48:48,130 --> 01:48:50,830
Yeah... it's just
too much for me.

1379
01:48:54,210 --> 01:48:55,680
I thought
I was strong.

1380
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:57,940
I just can't
take it, Kathy.

1381
01:48:57,940 --> 01:49:00,640
Apply for a stay.

1382
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:14,520
What if they
don't phone?

1383
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:20,700
Uh, well, you'll be
transferred to the other...

1384
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:23,000
cell block
at some point tomorrow.

1385
01:49:25,810 --> 01:49:28,740
That's the cell block
where they hang people.

1386
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:35,210
Yeah,
that's where they...

1387
01:49:35,210 --> 01:49:38,020
spend the last day.

1388
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:41,220
And then they do
their 1 07 steps.

1389
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:44,320
It's from that room...

1390
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,190
to the gallows,
isn't it?

1391
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:51,030
That's what they say,
Selma, but...

1392
01:49:51,030 --> 01:49:52,400
Look at...

1393
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:54,270
You're gonna get
your stay.

1394
01:49:54,270 --> 01:49:56,770
Why don't you try to
think of something nice,

1395
01:49:56,770 --> 01:49:57,860
all right?

1396
01:50:01,410 --> 01:50:03,740
It's just
so quiet here.

1397
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:08,240
What's that got
to do with it, Selma?

1398
01:50:13,050 --> 01:50:16,420
You know, when I used
to work in the factory...

1399
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:21,730
I used to dream
that I was in a musical,

1400
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:23,260
because, in a musical,

1401
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:26,200
nothing dreadful
ever happens.

1402
01:50:30,340 --> 01:50:32,460
But it's so quiet here.

1403
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:37,780
Don't the prisoners
march or something?

1404
01:50:37,780 --> 01:50:38,940
March?
No.

1405
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:40,010
Yeah?

1406
01:50:40,010 --> 01:50:40,850
No, they don't.
They don't...

1407
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:43,020
There's not...

1408
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:44,680
There's not much noise
around here, Selma,

1409
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:45,740
I know.

1410
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:51,520
But later they
turn on the radio.

1411
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,760
No, no, no.
There's no...

1412
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:56,820
They don't allow radio
in the isolation block.

1413
01:50:57,930 --> 01:51:01,530
But I've been listening
to the ventilation...

1414
01:51:01,530 --> 01:51:03,640
shaft.

1415
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:05,870
I hear sometimes
people singing there,

1416
01:51:05,870 --> 01:51:08,140
Iike...

1417
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:09,300
hymns or...

1418
01:51:10,610 --> 01:51:12,040
That's not
against the rules,

1419
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:13,940
to listen, is it?

1420
01:51:15,610 --> 01:51:16,980
No.

1421
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:18,710
I wonder if...

1422
01:51:20,290 --> 01:51:22,020
if maybe you're
hearing the singing

1423
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:23,560
coming from the chapel.

1424
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:24,720
Yeah?

1425
01:51:27,530 --> 01:51:29,460
Maybe you'll
even get a sermon.

1426
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:26,800
Selma...

1427
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,460
Selma...

1428
01:55:29,670 --> 01:55:31,770
You got your stay.

1429
01:55:31,770 --> 01:55:33,500
You got the stay.

1430
01:55:36,410 --> 01:55:37,930
I'm so happy for you.

1431
01:55:52,890 --> 01:55:54,830
I'm your new legal counsel.

1432
01:55:54,830 --> 01:55:56,530
My name is Luke, okay?

1433
01:55:56,530 --> 01:55:58,500
Oh, hi, Luke.

1434
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:01,500
I'm, uh, quite sure...

1435
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,330
I can get your sentence
commuted.

1436
01:56:04,300 --> 01:56:05,900
All I need is a signature

1437
01:56:05,900 --> 01:56:08,910
stating you want
the case re-opened...

1438
01:56:08,910 --> 01:56:10,880
and then I can get
all the paperwork ready

1439
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,570
by tomorrow.

1440
01:56:15,350 --> 01:56:16,550
Yeah.

1441
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:19,350
There's a lot of things
your other lawyer didn't do

1442
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:21,120
that I'm going to do.

1443
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:23,220
A lot of ground
that wasn't covered

1444
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:25,220
that I am going
to cover.

1445
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:27,430
The fact that you were
fighting for your boy

1446
01:56:27,430 --> 01:56:29,400
is something
we can really milk.

1447
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:33,530
I have some experience
in cases like this, so...

1448
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:36,870
That's what
the attorney before said.

1449
01:56:36,870 --> 01:56:37,930
Uh... yeah.

1450
01:56:39,170 --> 01:56:43,140
You see, he was
appointed by the court,

1451
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:45,240
and you don't get
the best legal counsel

1452
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:46,350
that way.

1453
01:56:46,350 --> 01:56:48,980
Y-You were not
appointed by the court?

1454
01:56:48,980 --> 01:56:51,480
I'm not appointed
by the court, no.

1455
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:53,180
You're gonna have
to pay me.

1456
01:56:56,990 --> 01:56:59,660
But... not to worry.

1457
01:56:59,660 --> 01:57:00,660
Yeah?

1458
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:02,090
That's been
taken care of.

1459
01:57:02,090 --> 01:57:05,060
I made a deal with
your... Iady friend?

1460
01:57:05,060 --> 01:57:06,270
Deal?

1461
01:57:06,270 --> 01:57:09,330
Yeah, in regard
to my fee.

1462
01:57:09,330 --> 01:57:11,640
I've agreed to
accept the amount

1463
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:14,110
that she said
she could raise.

1464
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:25,110
How much...

1465
01:57:26,490 --> 01:57:27,890
How much was it?

1466
01:57:27,890 --> 01:57:29,490
Well, I can tell you
precisely,

1467
01:57:29,490 --> 01:57:30,720
because I received
an envelope.

1468
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:33,190
It's, uh,
two thousand dollars--

1469
01:57:33,190 --> 01:57:37,430
$2,056.1 0?

1470
01:57:37,430 --> 01:57:39,450
That's it precisely.

1471
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:44,030
Now...

1472
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:48,340
There's something here.

1473
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:54,010
I'd like to just sort of
go over our tactics.

1474
01:57:54,010 --> 01:57:56,720
I have a couple of
questions to ask you.

1475
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:58,620
If he doesn't have
the operation next month,

1476
01:57:58,620 --> 01:58:00,050
it's gonna be too late!

1477
01:58:00,050 --> 01:58:02,690
And he will never
be able to see!

1478
01:58:02,690 --> 01:58:04,920
This is what
it's all about,

1479
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:06,660
so he can see
his grandchildren!

1480
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:08,860
Well, let me
tell you something.

1481
01:58:08,860 --> 01:58:10,100
The only thing
that's important to me

1482
01:58:10,100 --> 01:58:12,000
in my whole life,

1483
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,200
and you don't
understand, Kathy!

1484
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:15,830
- Listen to me!
- It's just plain stupidity!

1485
01:58:15,830 --> 01:58:17,470
- Listen to me!
- Waste that kind of money...

1486
01:58:17,470 --> 01:58:19,340
on a blind woman
who's gonna spend

1487
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:20,910
the rest of her life
in jail!

1488
01:58:20,910 --> 01:58:22,310
But he needs his mother,
you know,

1489
01:58:22,310 --> 01:58:23,310
alive,
no matter where!

1490
01:58:23,310 --> 01:58:24,910
You don't understand!

1491
01:58:24,910 --> 01:58:26,180
He needs his eyes!

1492
01:58:26,180 --> 01:58:27,610
- He needs his mother!
- No!

1493
01:58:27,610 --> 01:58:29,620
- Yes! Alive!
- No!

1494
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:31,450
Listen to reason
for once!

1495
01:58:31,450 --> 01:58:32,750
Selma.

1496
01:58:33,850 --> 01:58:34,950
Selma.

1497
01:58:34,950 --> 01:58:36,860
I listen to my heart.

1498
01:58:36,860 --> 01:58:39,190
I will go to the police.
I will tell them that...

1499
01:58:39,190 --> 01:58:41,420
you stole the money
from... from Bill.

1500
01:58:42,730 --> 01:58:44,100
Oh, yes,
I will tell that.

1501
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:46,100
I will
tell them that,

1502
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:47,470
that you stole it
from Bill,

1503
01:58:47,470 --> 01:58:49,470
and you will never see
the money again!

1504
01:58:49,470 --> 01:58:51,740
That will be gone
for good.

1505
01:58:51,740 --> 01:58:55,070
No operation! Nothing!
No mother! Nothing!

1506
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:07,290
You can have
your money back.

1507
01:59:07,290 --> 01:59:08,220
I just want
to make sure

1508
01:59:08,220 --> 01:59:11,660
that you fully comprehend

1509
01:59:11,660 --> 01:59:14,560
what this means,
this decision.

1510
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:15,560
Yeah.

1511
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:16,900
You fully realize
what will happen?

1512
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:18,000
Yeah.

1513
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,270
I already asked
for no more stays.

1514
01:59:21,270 --> 01:59:23,170
Once this starts,
there's no stopping it.

1515
01:59:23,170 --> 01:59:24,500
You understand me?

1516
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:26,830
Yeah.

1517
01:59:28,740 --> 01:59:30,300
I'm prepared.

1518
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:42,610
Gene says thank you.

1519
01:59:46,020 --> 01:59:47,820
Thanks for what?

1520
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:54,860
Oh, some comic books
on his birthday.

1521
01:59:58,270 --> 02:00:01,340
You can't buy him...
presents

1522
02:00:01,340 --> 02:00:04,510
and say it's from me.

1523
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:06,840
You have to stop
doing that, Jeff.

1524
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:10,470
Uh, maybe
you can just...

1525
02:00:15,190 --> 02:00:16,880
phone him.

1526
02:00:18,690 --> 02:00:21,890
Just say,
you know...

1527
02:00:21,890 --> 02:00:23,500
something to him.

1528
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:25,830
No, that's--that's
not a good idea.

1529
02:00:30,170 --> 02:00:33,000
He wants to be the one...

1530
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:37,600
who's allowed to be there
when it happens.

1531
02:00:40,980 --> 02:00:44,380
But l-- And then
they told him

1532
02:00:44,380 --> 02:00:45,820
he's too young.

1533
02:00:48,790 --> 02:00:51,760
Who put that crazy idea
into his head anyway?

1534
02:00:54,290 --> 02:00:55,820
I don't want him
to be there.

1535
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:00,660
I'll be there
if you would.

1536
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:04,670
And Kathy?

1537
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:12,770
You know Kathy.
She's...

1538
02:01:14,780 --> 02:01:16,540
She's still angry.

1539
02:01:18,750 --> 02:01:21,310
If you think
you can take it...

1540
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:26,260
I would love you
to be there.

1541
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:36,570
Don't cry, Jeff.

1542
02:01:36,570 --> 02:01:39,060
Jeff, don't cry.
It's gonna be fine.

1543
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:42,710
Jeff.

1544
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:54,520
Why did you have him?

1545
02:01:56,190 --> 02:01:58,950
You knew he would have
the same disease as you.

1546
02:02:09,270 --> 02:02:12,130
I just wanted to hold
a little baby...

1547
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:18,370
just in my arms.

1548
02:02:25,450 --> 02:02:26,940
I love you.

1549
02:02:59,050 --> 02:03:00,990
It's time, Selma.

1550
02:03:27,710 --> 02:03:29,270
Okay?

1551
02:03:32,250 --> 02:03:33,680
Okay.

1552
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:55,530
Your meal, Jezkova.

1553
02:06:01,730 --> 02:06:04,140
Selma Jezkova...

1554
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:05,360
It's time.

1555
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:25,850
Please stand.

1556
02:06:27,990 --> 02:06:29,890
She can walk on her own.

1557
02:06:34,230 --> 02:06:36,370
Selma...

1558
02:06:36,370 --> 02:06:40,270
I'm afraid my legs
aren't working very well.

1559
02:06:40,270 --> 02:06:42,070
You can do it, Selma.

1560
02:06:42,070 --> 02:06:43,140
Yeah.

1561
02:06:43,140 --> 02:06:44,280
I have a plan, okay?

1562
02:06:44,280 --> 02:06:45,470
Yeah.

1563
02:06:46,950 --> 02:06:48,510
You're gonna
stand up with me.

1564
02:06:48,510 --> 02:06:49,540
Yeah.

1565
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:52,280
I may make some noise.

1566
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:56,190
It will give you
something to listen to.

1567
02:06:56,190 --> 02:06:57,090
Yeah.

1568
02:06:57,090 --> 02:06:58,080
Listen.

1569
02:07:03,730 --> 02:07:06,870
There's 1 07 steps.

1570
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:08,370
Selma, listen
to the mark.

1571
02:07:08,370 --> 02:07:09,830
I couldn't even do one.

1572
02:07:09,830 --> 02:07:11,070
You can do it.

1573
02:07:11,070 --> 02:07:14,270
I can't do it!

1574
02:07:14,270 --> 02:07:15,930
Now listen, Selma.

1575
02:07:17,010 --> 02:07:19,440
I want you to do
one--there, one.

1576
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:23,720
Come on.

1577
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:24,880
Listen.

1578
02:07:26,850 --> 02:07:28,110
Two.

1579
02:07:29,820 --> 02:07:31,320
Three...

1580
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:32,320
four...

1581
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:34,760
five... six...

1582
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:36,660
seven... eight...

1583
02:07:36,660 --> 02:07:38,700
nine... ten...

1584
02:07:38,700 --> 02:07:41,830
11 ... 12... 13...

1585
02:07:41,830 --> 02:07:43,800
14... 15...

1586
02:07:43,800 --> 02:07:46,570
16... 17... 18...

1587
02:07:46,570 --> 02:07:48,940
19... 20...

1588
02:07:48,940 --> 02:07:51,410
21 ... 22... 23...

1589
02:07:51,410 --> 02:07:53,780
24... 25...

1590
02:07:53,780 --> 02:07:56,720
26... 27... 28...

1591
02:07:56,720 --> 02:07:58,410
29... 30...

1592
02:08:06,290 --> 02:08:08,120
39... 40...

1593
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:13,130
43... 44... 45...

1594
02:08:23,110 --> 02:08:24,510
55... 56...

1595
02:08:28,050 --> 02:08:30,240
60... 61 ... 62...

1596
02:08:38,060 --> 02:08:40,520
70... 71 ... 72...

1597
02:08:42,460 --> 02:08:45,830
75... 76... 77...

1598
02:09:02,910 --> 02:09:05,180
93... 94... 95...

1599
02:09:11,560 --> 02:09:13,860
104... 105...

1600
02:09:13,860 --> 02:09:15,260
106...

1601
02:09:15,260 --> 02:09:17,500
107.

1602
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:19,200
Selma Jezkova,

1603
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:20,660
do you have
any last words?

1604
02:09:25,970 --> 02:09:27,700
Very well.
Proceed.

1605
02:09:37,180 --> 02:09:38,710
Selma.

1606
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:42,080
Selma, you okay?

1607
02:09:45,690 --> 02:09:46,920
It's okay.
It's okay.

1608
02:09:50,900 --> 02:09:52,930
Come on now.

1609
02:09:52,930 --> 02:09:54,100
Use the board.

1610
02:09:54,100 --> 02:09:55,630
Oh, no, no. No, wait.
Give her a chance.

1611
02:09:55,630 --> 02:09:57,330
She can stand up.
She can stand.

1612
02:10:12,420 --> 02:10:13,380
In here.

1613
02:10:13,380 --> 02:10:16,820
It's okay.
It's okay.

1614
02:10:16,820 --> 02:10:18,320
It's okay.

1615
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:20,220
It's okay.

1616
02:10:22,830 --> 02:10:24,860
It's okay.

1617
02:10:24,860 --> 02:10:25,760
The straps
on her hands.

1618
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:27,030
I'm scared.

1619
02:10:27,030 --> 02:10:28,200
It's okay.

1620
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:29,860
- I'm so scared!
- I know.

1621
02:10:37,340 --> 02:10:38,710
On the mark.

1622
02:10:47,390 --> 02:10:48,750
No!

1623
02:10:48,750 --> 02:10:50,260
I can't do the hood!

1624
02:10:50,260 --> 02:10:52,220
It's okay.
Selma.

1625
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:54,030
I have to breathe!

1626
02:10:54,030 --> 02:10:55,790
Nobody told me
about the hood!

1627
02:10:55,790 --> 02:10:57,830
It's just so
you can't see, Selma.

1628
02:10:57,830 --> 02:10:59,260
- I can't breathe!
- I know.

1629
02:10:59,260 --> 02:11:00,670
I can't breathe!

1630
02:11:00,670 --> 02:11:02,430
- Look, look--
- I can't breathe!

1631
02:11:02,430 --> 02:11:03,570
I have to breathe!

1632
02:11:03,570 --> 02:11:04,260
Look,
she can't breathe.

1633
02:11:05,340 --> 02:11:07,440
She can't breathe!
She can't--

1634
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:09,470
I'm taking it.
I'm taking it.

1635
02:11:09,470 --> 02:11:11,480
This is irregular.

1636
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:13,240
I don't care
if it's irregular.

1637
02:11:13,240 --> 02:11:14,310
- We have regulations.
- She's blind--

1638
02:11:14,310 --> 02:11:16,010
I don't care about
the regulations!

1639
02:11:16,010 --> 02:11:17,050
The girl is blind,
for Christ's sake.

1640
02:11:17,050 --> 02:11:18,250
I'm gonna make a call.

1641
02:11:18,250 --> 02:11:20,080
Yeah, make the call--

1642
02:11:22,620 --> 02:11:23,660
Gene...

1643
02:11:23,660 --> 02:11:25,890
Yeah, we
have a situation here.

1644
02:11:25,890 --> 02:11:27,320
I'll hold for him.

1645
02:11:28,330 --> 02:11:29,390
Gene...

1646
02:11:29,390 --> 02:11:30,900
The woman's blind...
I'll wait.

1647
02:11:30,900 --> 02:11:33,100
Gene...

1648
02:11:33,100 --> 02:11:34,060
Gene...

1649
02:11:36,230 --> 02:11:37,600
Waiting for a call.

1650
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:39,570
Gene...

1651
02:11:48,210 --> 02:11:49,540
Gene!

1652
02:11:49,750 --> 02:11:51,080
Gene!

1653
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:55,320
Gene!

1654
02:11:55,320 --> 02:11:57,560
He--he's just outside.

1655
02:11:57,560 --> 02:11:59,420
He gave me these
for you.

1656
02:11:59,420 --> 02:12:00,860
Guard.

1657
02:12:00,860 --> 02:12:02,490
So he had the operation?

1658
02:12:02,490 --> 02:12:05,430
He will see
his grandchildren!

1659
02:12:05,430 --> 02:12:07,090
He is just outside.

1660
02:12:08,130 --> 02:12:09,390
You were right, Selma!
