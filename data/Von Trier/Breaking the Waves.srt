1
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,132
His name is Jan.

2
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,886
I do not know him.

3
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,852
He's from the rig.

4
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:05,356
You know we do not favor
matrimony with outsiders.

5
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,359
Can you even tell us
what matrimony is?

6
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:15,616
It's when two people
are joined in God.

7
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,786
Do you really believe
you're capable...

8
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:23,249
of bearing the responsibility not only
for your own marriage in God...

9
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,460
but also another's?

10
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,755
I know I am.

11
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:36,304
Can you think of anything
of real value...

12
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,557
that the outsiders
have brought with them?

13
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,856
Their music.

14
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:56,324
Out you go, Bess McNeill,
and be seated.

Bess.

23
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:44,580
- Bess, don't be silly. You'll ruin your...
- He's late.

24
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,666
All right, but at least he's coming.

25
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,835
Get this on then.
You're gonna ruin your dress.

26
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,837
He's late.

27
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,381
You're being silly. Come on.

28
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:54,674
- Come on.
- No.

29
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,133
Bess, get your coat on.

30
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,928
- Come on. Don't ruin it. It's a good day.
- No.

31
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,934
You're not supposed to see him.
You know that.

32
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,063
Bess, you're gonna ruin your...

33
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,316
Bess!

You're late!

00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,467
Come on.

36
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,811
Get in.

37
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,272
Hey!

38
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,652
Break out the bottle!

39
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,839
Come on.
It's my wedding.

40
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,683
Will you please be upstanding
for the bride?

00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,312
we worship thee...

49
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:17,984
as the author of
every good and perfect gift.

50
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,653
Christ loved the church...

51
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,823
and gave himself for her.

52
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:28,577
We should love Christ
and give ourselves to him.

53
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,666
If it is not too inappropriate...

54
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,501
may I say that you, Bess...

55
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,714
have shown that love
and that commitment in your own life.

56
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,425
It is not once or twice...

57
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,510
that you have been
in this building...

58
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,430
giving your time and effort
to cleaning it.

59
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,516
I know that
you have done that...

60
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,603
not so as to be well
thought of here on earth...

61
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,815
but out of your love
for God in heaven.

62
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,361
Congratulations.

63
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,986
Congratulations.

64
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,286
Great sermon, Father.

65
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,590
Ring the bells then.

66
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,469
Our church has no bells.

67
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,979
It's not too fun, is it?

68
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,483
- Oh!
- Oh!

69
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,194
- Hey!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

70
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,779
Great.

71
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,083
This is Dodo.

72
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,002
Oh, the sister-in-law.
We haven't really met, have we?

73
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:03,380
No. But everything happened so quickly.

74
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,759
What makes you say that?

75
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,346
I just mean...
Well, it did, didn't it?

76
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,558
Are you not happy for me?

77
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,941
Of course I am.

78
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,688
Of course I am.

79
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,487
Come on, Terry.

80
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,663
- Whoo-hoo-hoo! Hey!
- Yee-ha!

81
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,581
Hey, hey, hey!

82
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,711
Yee-ha!
Get along, little dogie!

83
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,555
Bess.

84
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,311
Yeah.

85
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,132
Dear Bess...

86
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,886
I've known you for six years...

87
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,763
and I can definitely say...

88
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,683
you have the biggest heart
of anyone I've ever met.

89
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:07,898
It wasn't easy for me here
when I married Sam...

90
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,317
but you welcomed me instantly...

91
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,403
and I won't ever forget that.

92
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,116
Your generosity knows no bounds...

93
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,077
like the time when
you lent Jack a bike...

94
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,497
because his was broken, only it was mine,
and I had to walk to work.

95
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,463
I was furious with you then...

96
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,465
but I regret that now...

97
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,718
because it's your spirit.

98
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,847
You'd give anything to anyone.

99
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:50,566
When Sam died,
I lost a husband and you, a brother.

100
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,158
We saw each other through that...

101
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,618
and promised to look after
one another.

102
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:06,707
You are the reason... Sorry.

103
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:11,837
You are the reason I have stayed
when I almost gave up in this cold place.

104
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,131
And now your warmth...

105
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,508
has embraced another outsider.

106
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,472
His name is Jan...

107
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:24,475
and I don't know much about him...

108
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,103
but I'll accept his right to be here...

109
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,440
because of you, Bess.

110
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:39,698
If he doesn't take care of you and give you
everything you need, I'll kill him.

111
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,204
Thank you...

112
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,539
for all you've given me, Bess.

113
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,876
I love you very much.

114
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,794
Have me now.

115
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,841
What, here?

116
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:53,021
Maybe you wanted
something more romantic.

117
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,191
This is lovely.

118
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,496
Are you sure?

119
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,711
No, have me.

120
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,047
What do I do?

121
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:04,987
You okay?

122
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,865
You've got blood on your dress.

123
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,926
Shall I go down and wait for you?

124
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,854
You okay?

125
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,034
Hi.

126
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,006
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

127
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,594
Yee-ha!

128
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,141
Take care of yourself.

129
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,769
Get her now, Jan.

130
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,688
Whoo!

131
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,064
Yeah!

132
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,486
Yeah!

133
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,863
Yeah!

134
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,198
Whoo!

135
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,409
- Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!
- Yeah!

136
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,373
Go get her, Jan!

137
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,542

What's so funny?

152
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,980
How could you take it?

153
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,774
How could keep away
from the boys?

154
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,154
I waited for you.

155
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,116
No, don't laugh.

156
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,452
Yeah.

157
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,499
But you must have been lonely.

158
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,168
Who did you talk to?

159
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:19,217
I thank you
for the greatest gift of all...

160
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:21,428
the gift of love.

161
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,890
I thank you for Jan.

162
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:30,312
I'm so lucky to have been
given these gifts.

163
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:38,236
But remember to be
a good girl, Bess...

164
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:42,282
for you know I giveth,
and I taketh away.

165
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,288
What? I didn't mean it like that.

166
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,625
Yes. I'll be good.

167
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,501
I'll be really, really good.

168
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,123
Thank you.

169
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,377
What did you say?

170
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,213
Thank you.

171
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,923
Fly...

172
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,718
away!

173
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,382
- Hello, Jan.
- Hello.

174
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,217
- Bess.
- Hello.

175
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,724
Why don't you have
any church bells?

176
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,478
We do not need bells in our church
to worship God.

177
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,859
I like church bells.

178
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,780
Let's put them back again.

179
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,954
Have fun.

180
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,586
But now, friends...

181
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,007
things have become very different.

182
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:51,262
It hurts me to have to say it...

183
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:55,433
but there appears to be
those in the church...

184
00:23:55,518 --> 00:24:01,606
who are prepared
to cling to the world...

185
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,026
instead of fleeing from it.

186
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:07,612
But those to whom I refer...

187
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,865
will know what I am speaking about.

188
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,160
It grieves my heart.

189
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:19,165
And I know there are others
who feel just the same.

190
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,543
Amen.

191
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:30,051
Mr. Donald John Beaton,
will you rise and address the question?

192
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,854
Thank you, Lord,
for this day you have blessed us with.

193
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:52,198
It's stupid that only men
can talk in the service.

194
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,784
Hold your tongue, woman.

195
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,084
<i>Lassie! It's Lassie!</i>

196
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:16,890
<i>It is Lassie!
I know it.</i>

197
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,768
<i>Lassie! Oh, Lassie!</i>

198
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,733
<i>Lassie! Oh, Lassie!</i>

199
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:29,068
<i>Oh, welcome home!</i>

200
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,083
They're burying Anthony now.

201
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,590
Go and listen to the minister.

202
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,383
Go on.

203
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,094
Yeah, you can do that if you want.

204
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,263
Men are allowed at funerals.

205
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,017
Go on.

206
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:20,036
Anthony Dod Mantle, who has been...

207
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:25,458
Anthony Dod Mantle,
you are a sinner...

208
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,544
and you deserve
your place in hell.

209
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,550
Hmm.

210
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:43,351
The minister said
he would go to hell.

211
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,228
Did he say that?

212
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,563
Bloody cheerful.

213
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:54,028
Well, Anthony will go to hell.
Everyone knows that.

214
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:04,038
You do realize that I will have to
go back soon, don't you?

215
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,940
You knew it all the time.

216
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,991
Lord, we are unworthy
of the least of all thy mercies.

217
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,493
We thank thee for this food.

218
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:45,496
Pardon our sins
for Jesus' sake. Amen.

219
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,623
Amen.

220
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,669
Okay.

221
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,141
When are you going back?

222
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,852
Oh, didn't you know?

223
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:12,982
Jan's gonna stay at home with me
and quit the rig because we're so happy.

224
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:15,651
Oh, Bess. Come on.

225
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,876
I wish I could.

226
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,222
I will not have that kind of
behavior in my house.

227
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:47,975
I'm sorry, Mother.
I'm sorry.

228
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,104
If you cannot control your moods,
it's the hospital again for you, my girl.

229
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:54,774
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Why should you be any different?

230
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,610
Every woman round here
has to learn to be alone...

231
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,946
when their man's away at sea
or on the oil rigs.

232
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:04,617
Even you can learn
how to endure.

233
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,051
I don't even know
who you are.

234
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,597
I don't know
anything about you.

235
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,475
And quite frankly...

236
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,645
I'm sorry... I'm sorry to say this,
but I don't trust you.

237
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,611
She's...

238
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,239
She's very susceptible...

239
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,035
and you could get her to...

240
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,082
You could get her to do
anything you wanted.

241
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,544
No, I don't think so.

242
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,008
How am I supposed to
look out for her now?

243
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:07,096
What do you wanna do?
Keep her here?

244
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:10,433
- Locked up for the rest of her life?
- She hasn't got the strength.

245
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:14,228
- She's stronger than you and me.
- You don't understand, do you?

246
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:18,441
- She's not right in the head.
- Come on. She just wants it all.

247
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,338
What's this?

248
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,048
Hmm?

249
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,842
What?

250
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,597
What's that?

251
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,473
What's that?

252
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,353
It's a present.

253
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:58,606
- Can I open it?
- Yeah, sure. Open it.

254
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:18,709
Nice colors, aren't they?
Very cheerful.

255
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,512
It's open.

256
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,139
- Just waiting for you, bud.
- Please.

257
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,324
Yeah, that's fine.
Do you want a little snort?

258
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,088
Look at you.

259
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,319
Bess.

260
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,891
Hey. Hey.

261
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,562
Come, come, come, come.

262
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,566
Okay.

263
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,957
All right? Come on.

264
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,920
It's okay.

265
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,461
It's okay.

266
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,506
Okay.

267
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,360
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

268
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,822
Watch your head.

269
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:37,658
Okay?

270
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,665
It's just a couple of months.

271
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,146
Good-bye!

272
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,643
No!

273
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:46,727
Bess!

274
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,064
Don't leave!

275
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,902
Bess.

276
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:19,718
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right here.

277
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,011
Okay?

278
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,055
You'll be all right.

279
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,394
You all right?
You okay?

280
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,396
Oh, dear.

281
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,565
Let's give you one of these.

282
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:18,527
Come on.
Get one of these down ya.

283
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,700
Come on, darling.
Take one of these. That's it.

284
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,536
Pop it in your mouth.
Swallow.

You are guilty
of selfishness, Bess.

297
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,169
You didn't even consider
for one second...

298
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,714
how painful
it must have been for him.

299
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:24,593
You put your own feelings
before everyone else's.

300
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:29,848
I can't see that you love him
when you behave like that.

301
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:34,645
Now you must promise
to be a good girl, Bess.

302
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,113
I promise to be a good girl.

303
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:07,428
I'm sorry for the way
I behaved, Mother.

304
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,806
That's all right, Bessie.

305
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:17,479
Mother, would it be okay if I
came home for a bit while Jan's away?

306
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,858
Of course it would, Bessie.

307
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,621
Okay.

308
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,041
Get on it.

309
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,051
A little bit of this shit.

310
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,261
Mmm!

311
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:52,973
Oh, shit.

312
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,646
- Nice.
- Huh?

313
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,151
You know the waves are...

314
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,779
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck's wrong with you?

315
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,405
Just piss.
Just give me one.

316
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,365
Just wait.

317
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,620
- Now, you know, there's some nice...
- Shit.

318
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,247
- Sorry, guys.
- Just throw the goddamn radio away.

319
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,333
You can't get anything
in here anyhow.

320
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,377
You and your fucking radio.

321
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,173
No! Fuck!

322
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,717
- Geez!
- Come on. Dance. Dance.

323
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:31,303
Yee-ha! Yee-ha! Yee-ha!

324
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,971
Yee-ha!

325
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,309
Fire!

326
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,392
Fire!

327
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:38,602
What? Oh!

328
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,895
- Ah!
- Shit.

329
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,480
Whoo, whoo!
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

330
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,524
- Hey!
- Toro, toro, toro!

331
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,042
Didn't he say he'd call?

332
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,003
Do you want me to wait with you?

333
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,383
Yes, please.

334
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,595
Where the fuck
is the second shift?

335
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,056
I got a phone call to make.

336
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,940
I gotta go to the hospital.

337
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,778
- Are you cold?
- No.

338
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:31,280
No?

339
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,115
You all right?

340
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,161
Don't wait too long, will ya?

341
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,843
Oh, shit.

342
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:07,482
Pim, I gotta make a phone call.
Get out of here.

343
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,393
Hello?

344
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,437
<i>Oh, uh, is Bess there?</i>

345
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,481
One moment.

346
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,651
Bess. Bess.

347
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,912
- Is that you, Bess?
<i>- Hi.</i>

348
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,874
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.
I couldn't get to the phone earlier.</i>

349
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,751
That's okay.

350
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,380
Well, don't you
love me anymore?

351
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,590
Oh.

352
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,134
Of course I do.

353
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,803
Say so then.

354
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:22,349
I'd made up my mind not to.

355
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:26,270
Everyone says that...

356
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:29,106
I love you too much, and...

357
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,859
if you found out
how much I loved you...

358
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,237
you might get upset...

359
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,447
because we're not
together right now.

360
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:41,368
Oh, Bess, never stop
saying you love me. You hear?

361
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,288
- Yes.
- No matter what anybody says.

362
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,708
Yes.

363
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,629
Say it then.

364
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:59,845
I love you so much.

365
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,393
I love you too.

366
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,988
I can hear you breathing.

367
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,535
Can you hear me?

368
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:43,513
<i>♪ Take me on a roller coaster ♪</i>

369

374
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,823
What are you thinking?

375
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,953
<i>That you're here.</i>

376
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:09,915
- What are you doing?
<i>- Mmm.</i>

377
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:13,251
Uh...

378
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:16,713
I'm touching your arms...

379
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:19,049
and your chest...

380
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,095
and your tummy...

381
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,556
and...

382
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,229
your prick.

383
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,150
You're so huge.

384
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:45,117
Jan will be home
in 10 days for a week.

385
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:46,743
Pardon?

386
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:50,997
Jan will be home
in 10 days for a week.

387
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,419
Pits?

388
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,504
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

389
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,506
Where's Jan?

390
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,510
I'm the only one back.
Hurt my wrist.

391
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,179
- They sent me home.
- Oh.

392
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:08,849
He sends his love.

393
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,937
- How long have you got off now?
- Well, only three days.

394
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,647
- Oh.
- Yeah.

395
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,316
You know me. Ha.

396
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:22,195
I'm back. Oh, sorry.

397
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:34,666
How long has she been asleep?

398
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,294
What's the matter with you?
Cat got your tongue?

399
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,962
Oh.

400
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,049
Have you taken my calendar?

401
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,135
What?

402
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:48,305
- Have you taken my calendar?
- No, I have not.

403
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:50,807
What would I want
with your calendar?

404
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:52,809
Don't be ridiculous.

405
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:56,021
- You've taken it.
- I have not taken it.

406
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:59,232
- Yes, you have.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

407
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,067
What calendar?

408
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,741
Where is it?

409
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:23,507
Bess, you've got to stop
all this, you know.

410
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,675
You've got to go on living
when he isn't here.

411
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,137
I mean, he's not dead. You're not dead.
You know what I mean?

412
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:33,225
- Give it to me.
- You just... You've got to stop it.

413
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,251
Shh.

414
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,836
- It's all right. Nothing. Go back to sleep.
- What's going on?

415
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,922
- It's all right. It's all right.
- Was that Bess?

416
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,341
- No, it's okay.
- Bit of hysterics.

417
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,301
No, no. It's all right.
I'll sort it out.

418
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:10,720
- We're not to have this carry-on in the house.
- I know.

419
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,515
- Just stay where you are. Go back to sleep.
- It's terrible.

420
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,325
Bess McNeill...

421
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,579
for many years
you've prayed for love.

422
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:37,581
Shall I take it away
from you again?

423
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:39,874
Is that what you want?

424
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:44,504
Oh. No.

425
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:48,008
I'm still grateful for love.

426
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:53,054
What do you want then?

427
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:01,771
I pray for Jan to come home.

428
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:07,152
He will be coming home
in 10 days.

429
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:10,363
You must learn to endure.
You know that.

430
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:18,538
I can't wait.

431
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:26,171
This is unlike you, Bess.

432
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:30,467
Out there, there are people
who need Jan and his work.

433
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,802
What about them?

434
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:38,975
They don't matter.

435
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,728
Nothing else matters.

436
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,690
I just want Jan home again.

437
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:49,110
I pray to you.

438
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:53,698
Oh, please,
won't you send him home?

439
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:01,247
Are you sure
that's what you want?

440
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,254
Yes.

441
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,837
Blow out!

442
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:51,798
- Hey! Get away! Blow out!
- Terry!

443
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:54,018
Terry!

444
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:58,054
Terry!

445
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:01,391
Terry? Terry!

446
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:03,852
Terry! Terry!

447
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,106
Terry!

448
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,842
Watch out!

449
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:40,597
Jan!

450
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,766
- Go get... Call a medic!
- Medic!

451
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,621
I don't know what kind of condition.

452
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:07,916
I think it's very serious though.

453
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,793
I don't know
what on earth...

454
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:20,470
It's Jan. There's been
an accident on the rig.

455
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:18,152
Jan, can you hear me?

456
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,659
Oh.

457
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,044
What are you doing?

458
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:37,380
I'm holding your hand.

459
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,591
Don't touch me.

460
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:42,176
- Don't touch me!
- Jan, relax. Just take...

461
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,067
Sit down here. Okay?

462
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,362
That's it. That's it.

463
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,531
You all right? You all right?

464
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:06,242
Shh. Deep breath.
Come on.

465
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:10,079
Hello. Talk to me, darling.
Talk to me.

466
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,792
Talk to me.
Come on. Oh, come on.

467
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:18,630
It's all right.
It's gonna be all right.

468
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:41,194
Uh, they're gonna operate
straightaway.

469
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,572
It'll be a few hours,
so I think we better wait...

470
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,866
Bess.

471
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:49,744
Bess, you can't go in there.

472
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,537
- I want to be with him.
- It's not allowed.

473
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,706
I know you do.
I know, but come on. Come with me.

474
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,125
No, I want to see him
all the time.

475
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,211
Bess, it's not a good idea.

476
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,129
- Come on.
- Bess. Bess. Please.

477
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:02,882
You can't stay here.
It's just not possible.

478
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:05,051
Bess.

479
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,886
Can I have a word with you?

480
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:09,263
Stay there, all right?
Don't move.

481
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,171
I want you to pray with me.

482
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,218
- What?
- Please.

483
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:05,486
Dear God...

484
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:10,867
we pray that you will
hold your hand over Jan...

485
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:13,453
and not let him die.

486
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:16,664
Amen.

487
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,827
Mrs. Nyman,
will you please come with me?

488
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,359
Will he live?

489
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:32,740
We have stabilized
your husband's condition for the time being.

490
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,539
Will he live?

491
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:42,333
Yes. Yes, Bess.
He will live.

492
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:54,428
Your husband suffered
very serious injuries.

493
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:59,225
Life shouldn't always
be preserved at any cost.

494
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,896
What do you mean?

495
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:10,153
Um, well, the doctor means,
Bess, that...

496
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:12,238
um, sometimes...

497
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:17,034
in some cases,
when life isn't worth living...

498
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,662
then it may be better to die.

499
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,920
You don't know Jan...

500
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:30,673
or you could not
say such a thing.

501
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:34,927
Your husband
may never walk again.

502
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:38,931
We think he'll be
completely paralyzed.

503
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:44,020
But he'll live.

504
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,688
Yes.

505
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,608
He will live, it seems.

506
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,410
Father...

507
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:03,331
are you there?

508
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:05,458
Are you still there?

509
00:59:09,922 --> 00:59:13,758
Of course I am, Bess.
You know that.

510
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,144
What's happening?

511
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:33,778
You wanted Jan home.

512
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:42,078
I've changed my mind.
Why... Why did I ask for that?

513
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:50,002
Because you're
a stupid little girl, Bess.

514
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,838
I had to test you.

515
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:56,342
Your love for Jan
has been put to the test.

516
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,771
Thank you for not letting him die.

517
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:16,362
You're welcome, Bess.

01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:30,269
that if there is
one of these commandments...

529
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:33,064
which you do not love...

530
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:35,900
and do not obey...

531
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:39,653
you have no place
at the Lord's table.

532
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:07,306
- When did you get back?
- I came back with Jan.

533
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,809
Oh. It's nice to see you.

534
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,453
- Ta-da!
- Surf's up!

535
01:02:29,538 --> 01:02:31,414
- Hi.
- Hi, guys.

536
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:34,500
- How you doing, bud?
- I'm fine. How are you?

537
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,085
Okay.

538
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,132
Did you find anything?

539
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:45,344
Gas. Nothing really.

540
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:47,930
Guess what now.
We're heading up north.

541
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:52,351
- Well, north, that's good.
- That's where you always said the oil was.

542
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:55,855
What are you doing here anyway?
We're meant to be out drilling.

543
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:58,190
I...

544
01:02:59,568 --> 01:03:01,986
just felt like
putting my feet up for a while.

545
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,947
Wouldn't trust you two guys
out there alone.

546
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,712
Well, my...

547
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,631
my arms aren't okay, so...

548
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:25,551
I'm not thirsty anyway.

549
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:29,805
Bullshit!

550
01:03:34,603 --> 01:03:36,645
Here. Come on.

551
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,397
Come on.

552
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:42,401
Oh, man. Sorry.

553
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:52,328
- Oh, man. Sorry.
- Thank you.

554
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:54,163
Thank you.

555
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:09,220
I'm not really supposed
to have any visitors, so...

556
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:11,222
We really don't have
the time either.

557
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:14,433
- Okay.
- Okay.

558
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,810
- You take care of yourself, huh?
- Take care.

559
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,146
Get well soon.

560
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:21,232
See you, guys.

561
01:04:31,243 --> 01:04:33,702
Will you do something for me?

562
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:35,621
Yes?

563
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:41,835
The next time you come,
could you wear something more...

564
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,215
more loose?

565
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:49,927
So I, uh...

566
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,972
So I won't have to see your body.

567
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:36,932
Bess, you'll have to go now,
'cause Jan needs to rest.

568
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:38,767
All right?

569
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:53,115
You shouldn't get him
too overemotional, you know.

570
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,200
It's not good for him.

571
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,329
I'm sorry.

572
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:00,497
You got to cheer him up.

573
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:06,879
Is he asleep now?

574
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:10,132
Well, he should be,
with the amount I've given him.

575
01:06:12,344 --> 01:06:15,638
Would it be all right
if I went and had a look at him?

576
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:39,328
I love you, Jan.

577
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:51,131
I love you too, Bess.

578
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:55,177
You are the love of my life.

579
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:18,283
Bess.

580
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,038
Where have you been?

581
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:25,457
I've been to the church.

582
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:30,254
What, at 2:00 in the morning?

583
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,555
I don't want you
getting ill again...

584
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:41,557
like you did when Sam died.

585
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:45,018
- I said I've been to the church.
- It's nothin' to do with the church.

586
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:47,020
Did you hear what I said?

587
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,148
Did you?

588
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:54,820
I don't want you to get ill again
like you did when Sam died.

589
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:58,907
I've had a word with Dr. Richardson.
All right?

590
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:02,327
And... And he says
he could see you tomorrow.

591
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:04,538
Oh, can he?

592
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:15,048
Bess, would you
like to come in?

593
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:40,282
Dodo said I had to come.

594
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:43,035
She has this idea
about me treating you.

595
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:49,708
My predecessor admitted you
a few years ago.

596
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:53,462
Uh, wh...
why did he do that?

597
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:56,381
I don't know.

598
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,967
No, nor do I.

599
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:02,346
You were upset
because your brother had died, and...

600
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:04,681
now you're upset
because your husband's ill.

601
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:07,559
Nothing unusual about that.

602
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:12,481
Am I not going to have some pills?

603
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,858
I'm probably not like your old doctor.

604
01:09:14,943 --> 01:09:16,860
I don't think that people
should be given pills...

605
01:09:16,945 --> 01:09:19,404
just because they do
what's only natural.

606
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:24,618
Maybe showing what you feel isn't
the done thing from where you come from...

607
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:27,746
but it's certainly no disease.

608
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:34,002
What happened on the rig
was my fault.

609
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,714
How come?

610
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:41,927
I prayed to God to send him home.

611
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:46,348
Wow.

612
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,187
Wow.

613
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:54,773
What powers you possess.

614
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:59,278
Come on. Do you really... Do you really
believe that you possess such powers?

615
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:04,324
I know you people
believe a lot about yourselves.

616
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:05,784
Bess...

617
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:11,248
perhaps you should do a bit of grieving
for yourself instead of him.

618
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:14,793
I think you should come and see me
now and again if you feel like it.

619
01:10:21,009 --> 01:10:22,551
I'm sorry.

620
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:24,344
Oh.

621
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:25,929
Come on.

622
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:30,100
Things will pick up
once he gets home again.

01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:31,578
Special.

638
01:11:31,663 --> 01:11:33,789
Shall I open your present?

639
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:35,165
Yes.

640
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:38,460
- Lovely.
- Present.

641
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:44,466
Can you see all right?

642
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,930
What is it?

643
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:51,932
Wait and see.

644
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:01,817
I don't believe it.
Where did you get that?

645
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:04,152
- I got it in a shop.
- That is...

646
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:10,993
That is
the stupidest thing I've ever seen.

647
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:13,203
Oh, look.
It's not doing anything now.

648
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,164
All right.
Go on. Well, go on.

649
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:22,129
That is just terrible.

650
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:34,099
How daft that is. Completely daft.
Just like...

651
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:36,893
Happy birthday, Jan.

652
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:38,687
Thank you.

653
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,939
I'll see you later.

654
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:47,946
Do you like it?

655
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:49,990
Oh, yes. It's...

656
01:12:51,034 --> 01:12:54,327
It's w... It's nice.

657
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:57,789
I'll give you your pill.

658
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:12,471
Okay?

659
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,515
Oh. One more drink.

660
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,645
Okay?

661
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,856
Yeah. It went down.
Thank you.

662
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:36,078
Happy birthday.

663
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:48,715
I'm finished, Bess.

664
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:53,720
No.

665
01:13:57,225 --> 01:14:00,393
You could take a lover
without anybody noticing.

666
01:14:03,815 --> 01:14:06,191
But you can't divorce me.

667
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,527
They'd never let you.

668
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:37,055
- Bess.
- No. No.

669
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:46,523
Is that what you think I want?

670
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,694
You cripple!

671
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:15,010
You must make up with him.

672
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:19,264
A husband and wife have to be able
to talk to each other.

673
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:22,893
He's the one who is helpless...

674
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:27,355
and you're the one
who must show you're strong.

675
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:31,943
Go to him, and tell him
you are sorry you were angry.

676
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:35,739
You have God.

677
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:39,826
You have the strength
your life in God has bestowed upon you.

678
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:44,956
And that is a strength
he does not possess.

679
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:50,188
Oh, no.

680
01:16:50,982 --> 01:16:52,649
Come on.

681
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:55,652
Come on, love.
Be all right.

682
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:58,113
That's it. Come on. That's it.

683
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:00,448
That's it.

684
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:02,951
It's all right, all right, all right.

685
01:17:05,705 --> 01:17:07,789
Don't know what she's thinking of...

686
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,125
going off leaving you like this.

687
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:12,711
You must admit that she was...

688
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:19,301
she was happy when we got married.

689
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:26,516
She blossomed...

690
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:29,060
didn't she?

691
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:37,569
I can't just lie here.

692
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:43,908
I can't even make love to her.

693
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:48,079
She's gotta get out of here.

694
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:52,042
She's gotta get on with life.

695
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:54,961
Help me set her free.

696
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:04,387
She'd do anything for you, Jan.

697
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:06,765
You know that.

698
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:08,933
She doesn't care
anything about herself.

699
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:12,687
But she'd do anything for you.

700
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:16,608
Just to see a smile on your face.

701
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:20,487
Do you understand me?

702
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:25,533
Yeah.

703
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:27,118
Right.

704
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,664
Thanks for telling me.

705
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:33,333
No trouble.

706
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:38,129
Do you want me to read to you?

707
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:40,298
Hmm?

708
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:44,803
Are you all right?

709
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:35,562
They took him back
to the hospital.

710
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:41,943
Bess. Bess, what is going on?

711
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:43,736
- What happened? Is he...
- He went unconscious.

712
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,280
We had to bring him back here.

713
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:46,990
We can't have him
at home anymore...

714
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:49,159
not if you're gonna go running off
and leaving him like that.

715
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:51,786
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it's just not good enough.

716
01:19:51,871 --> 01:19:55,290
I'm not... I'm not even allowed
to kiss him anymore.

717
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:59,085
Why don't you try listening
to what he says, Bess?

718
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:00,962
It's up to you.

719
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:04,716
He hasn't got anyone else.
You could give him the will to live.

720
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,926
It's more than
any doctor could do.

721
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:24,194
Bess?

722
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:26,571
I'm sorry.

723
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:30,617
No, it was my fault.

724
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:32,744
Come here.

725
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:42,425
Hi.

726
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:44,756
Hi.

727
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,098
Love is a mighty power...

728
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,352
isn't it?

729
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,608
If I'll die...

730
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:06,945
it will be because
love cannot keep me alive.

731
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:12,575
But I can hardly remember
what it's like to make love...

732
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:18,790
and if I forget that, then I'll die.

733
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:25,880
Remember when I phoned you
from the rig...

734
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:30,593
and we made love
without being together?

735
01:21:30,678 --> 01:21:33,596
Do you want me to talk to you
like that again? I-I'd love to.

736
01:21:33,681 --> 01:21:35,348
Bess...

737
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:38,560
I want you to find a man...

738
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:40,436
to make love to...

739
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:44,065
and then come back here
and tell me about it.

740
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:48,736
It will feel like you and me
being together again.

741
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:52,198
Now, that... that
will keep me alive.

742
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,997
I... I can't.

743
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,167
This morning when I...

744
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:07,380
when I told you to...
to get a lover...

745
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:09,090
it wasn't for your sake.

746
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:11,009
It was for my sake.

747
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:16,973
Because I don't want to die.

748
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:22,353
I'm afraid.

749
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:26,524
You understand?

750
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:29,861
Yes.

751
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:32,447
It will be you and me, Bess.

752
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:34,490
Do it for me.

753
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:37,869
I...

754
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:41,039
I can't.

755
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,584
Please?

756
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:57,805
Bess?

757
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:00,016
Are you all right?

758
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:02,977
Sure?

759
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:08,858
Here you go.

760
01:23:11,737 --> 01:23:13,905

Think it's perked up a bit.

777
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:30,481
You should think
of yourself a bit too.

778
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:32,900
Go out.

779
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:35,820
Go dancing.

01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,906
I've seen you dance.

781
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:44,203
You like to dance.

782
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:55,173
Where is Jan?

783
01:24:59,386 --> 01:25:01,471
There's nothing
you can do in here.

784
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:06,517
Don't let him die.

785
01:25:09,897 --> 01:25:12,899
And why shouldn't I let him die?

786
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:18,112
I love him.

787
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:24,035
So you keep saying,
but I don't see it.

788

There's nothing I can do.

789
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:31,876
There's nothing at all.

790
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:42,804
Prove to me that you love him...

791
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,931
and then I'll let him live.

792
01:26:04,243 --> 01:26:06,536
I've come to dance.

793
01:26:20,259 --> 01:26:24,262
It's great. You're great. Great movement.

You can touch me now.

803
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:33,164
You can have me now.

804
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:37,376
Bess, listen to me.
We're not going to make love.

805
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:39,962
Now put your clothes back on.

806
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:44,425
Don't you want me?

807
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:48,930
Don't you like me?

808
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:51,515
You said that you liked me.

809
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,601
Yes, Bess, I like you.

810
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,436
Now put your clothes on.

811
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,813
You don't understand.
I'll...

812
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:01,359
I'll be good to you and...

813
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:04,779
I want us to make love.

814
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:07,740
Listen, um, Bess...

815
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:10,201
if you want to talk to me...

816
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:12,495
we can meet at the hospital,
all right?

817
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:14,789
Now please just...
put your clothes on, Bess.

818
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:20,127
Please. I don't know
what to do with you.

819
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:22,922
All right now, just...

820
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:26,217
put your clothes on, Bess,
and go home.

821
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:30,429
No.

822
01:28:39,064 --> 01:28:41,482
I'm lying on my back...

823
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:44,443
all naked...

824
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:47,154
and...

825
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:50,616
he comes in and he sees me...

826
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:55,830
and...

827
01:28:55,914 --> 01:28:58,249
he kisses my breasts.

828
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:02,920
Um...

829
01:29:04,381 --> 01:29:07,550
and he enters me...

830
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:12,430
um...

831
01:29:13,306 --> 01:29:14,682
and...

832
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:18,227
he's making love to me...

833
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:21,981
gently...

834
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:25,109
and...

835
01:29:27,237 --> 01:29:29,030
he's coming.

836
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:52,303
It was Dr. Richardson.

837
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:18,579
Hi.

838
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:20,247
- Hi, Bess.
- Hi, Bess.

839
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:21,832
Where you going then?

840
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:24,043
Uh, I've got to go
to the church.

841
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:25,669
Oh.

842
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:31,467
Jan, we're gonna take you
off the respirator for five minutes...

843
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:34,470
to exercise your lungs a little bit
and see how you are.

844
01:30:34,554 --> 01:30:37,723
So just relax and take it easy.

845
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:45,689
Okay, start to breathe
by yourself now, Jan.

846
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:48,234
Just take very deep breaths.

847
01:30:48,318 --> 01:30:50,778
Slowly.

848
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:53,197
That's it.

849
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,282
And again.

850
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:00,704
Very good.

851
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:03,082
Deep breaths.

852
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:04,875
That's it.

853
01:31:14,136 --> 01:31:16,428
Bess.

854
01:31:16,513 --> 01:31:18,055
Yes?

855
01:31:27,107 --> 01:31:30,442
What are you doing on this bus?

856
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:34,029
Which bus, Jan?

857
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:38,826
Come to me.

858
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:41,954
Come.

859
01:31:46,293 --> 01:31:48,085
I'm here.

860
01:31:49,296 --> 01:31:51,630
I'm here in the back.

861
01:31:51,715 --> 01:31:53,174
Yes?

862
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:55,801
- In the back of the bus.
- Yes.

863
01:31:55,886 --> 01:31:57,887
Come.

864
01:32:01,474 --> 01:32:03,893
Dodo?

865
01:32:03,977 --> 01:32:06,228
- Dodo.
- Hang on.

866
01:32:06,313 --> 01:32:08,189
Jan.

867
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:10,858
Go and get Dr. Richardson.

868
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:14,320
I'm gonna put you back
on the respirator now, Jan.

869
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,531
Jan, can you hear me?

870
01:32:19,409 --> 01:32:21,660
Are you awake?

871
01:32:22,704 --> 01:32:24,288
Talk to me.

872
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:37,218
Hi, Bess.
I'd like to have a chat with you.

873
01:32:39,638 --> 01:32:41,931
- Bess?
- Mmm.

874
01:32:45,435 --> 01:32:48,562
This is my bus.
This is my bus.

875
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:39,900
Forgive me, Father.

876
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:41,819
I have sinned.

877
01:35:47,617 --> 01:35:49,743
Mary Magdalene sinned...

878
01:35:49,828 --> 01:35:52,496
and she's among
my dearly beloved.

879
01:36:22,444 --> 01:36:25,112
I go to the back of the bus...

880
01:36:26,322 --> 01:36:28,198
and you're there.

881
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:37,207
And you're so huge...

882
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:42,254
that you're almost bursting
out of your pants.

883
01:36:47,886 --> 01:36:51,388
And I undo your fly...

884
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,936
and I touch you.

885
01:37:00,899 --> 01:37:03,901
I'm touching your prick.

886
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:45,234
Have you been in to see Jan?

887
01:37:46,736 --> 01:37:49,196
- How is he?
- Better.

888
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:52,157
- He's better?
- Just a bit.

889
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:01,959
Hey, Bess, it looks like your prayers
have been answered.

890
01:38:02,043 --> 01:38:05,963
We've been able to take him
off the respirator.

891
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:07,881
Good news, isn't it?

892
01:38:18,476 --> 01:38:20,143
Do you think...

893
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:25,732
that we turn to different people...

894
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:29,236
when we get close to the edge?

895
01:38:30,530 --> 01:38:33,156
And that we, um...

896
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:35,158
we turn bad...

897
01:38:36,369 --> 01:38:38,370
when we're going to die?

898
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,834
You're not going to die.

899
01:38:45,169 --> 01:38:47,629
I know you're not.

900
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,841
I promise you.

Here you go.

912
01:40:07,627 --> 01:40:09,795
Hey, hey, girlies!

913
01:40:09,879 --> 01:40:13,173
We found some shroomies!

914
01:40:22,433 --> 01:40:25,102
Don't get your hopes up
too high, will you?

915
01:40:26,354 --> 01:40:29,898
Dr. Richardson says that
Jan could get worse again.

916
01:40:31,526 --> 01:40:34,277
I'm the one
who saved his life.

917
01:40:34,362 --> 01:40:36,738
I can save it again.

918
01:40:36,823 --> 01:40:39,825
Bess. What are you
talking about?

919
01:40:41,327 --> 01:40:43,787
I told Jan stories.

920
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:46,707
Stories about love.

921
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:50,836
That was almost like
being together, him and me.

922
01:40:52,130 --> 01:40:54,381
You see, love can save Jan.

923
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:56,883
He must not forget about love.

924
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:58,885
He told me that.

925
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:01,388
He tells me what to do.

926
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:03,724
Bess, I'm glad
that you listen to Jan...

927
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:06,893
but don't let him gain
too much power over you.

928
01:41:06,978 --> 01:41:09,604
Sickness is a mighty power.
You know that.

929
01:41:09,689 --> 01:41:11,356
I've saved Jan.

930
01:41:11,441 --> 01:41:14,234
Don't talk like that.
It's stupid!

931
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:18,405
You always said
that I wasn't stupid.

932
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:21,032
Well, you're stupid
if you say things like that.

933
01:41:21,117 --> 01:41:23,285
Why are you saying
I'm stupid now?

934
01:41:23,369 --> 01:41:25,454
Because I can see
that you're disappearing...

935
01:41:25,538 --> 01:41:27,247
into a world of make-believe...

936
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:28,957
and it worries me.

937
01:41:30,209 --> 01:41:33,420
I used to go mad when people
called you stupid, but...

938
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:35,505
you are stupid!

939
01:41:37,383 --> 01:41:40,302
We're gonna put a drain in this afternoon.
Just wait and see.

940
01:41:40,386 --> 01:41:43,430
It'll be much easier to get through to him.

941
01:41:43,514 --> 01:41:46,683
Don't worry.
It's a very minor operation.

942
01:41:48,895 --> 01:41:51,897
Are you trying to make me feel guilty?

943
01:41:53,065 --> 01:41:55,192
What makes you say that?

944
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:02,532
I think she's trying
to make me feel guilty.

945
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,959
Come here.

946
01:42:18,382 --> 01:42:20,634
You look fucking awful.

947
01:42:24,931 --> 01:42:27,140
Why do you dress like that?

948
01:42:30,478 --> 01:42:32,646
You dress like a widow.

949
01:42:34,941 --> 01:42:36,650
I'm not even dead yet.

950
01:42:39,946 --> 01:42:42,405
Maybe you wish I was.

951
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:45,116
No! No, no.

952
01:42:45,201 --> 01:42:47,410
You haven't done
what I asked you to.

953
01:42:47,495 --> 01:42:48,995
I have!

954
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:52,249
I asked you to be with a man.

955
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:54,626
I... I have done that.

956
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:57,212
You call that being with a man?

957
01:42:57,296 --> 01:42:59,297
I call it a joke.

958
01:43:05,137 --> 01:43:06,805
I love you.

959
01:43:06,889 --> 01:43:09,307
I don't love some other man.

960
01:43:11,269 --> 01:43:12,811
Prove it.

961
01:43:18,234 --> 01:43:20,068
Bess.

962
01:43:20,152 --> 01:43:22,070
What is going on?

963
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:25,156
Are you sleeping with other men
to feed his sick fantasies?

964
01:43:26,617 --> 01:43:28,660
He did get better.

965
01:43:28,744 --> 01:43:31,162
No, he did not get better.

966
01:43:31,247 --> 01:43:34,666
That's just the way it goes.
Sometimes he's better, sometimes he's worse.

967
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:37,836
Nothing to do with what you're doing.
That's all in your mind.

968
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,546
He is my husband...

969
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:42,549
and God has said
that I must honor him.

970
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:44,551
Well, if that's what
honoring is all about...

971
01:43:44,635 --> 01:43:46,845
then I must have something wrong.

972
01:43:46,929 --> 01:43:49,848
Well, you don't come
from around here, do you?

973
01:43:49,932 --> 01:43:51,850
No, and I'm glad I don't.

974
01:43:51,934 --> 01:43:55,186
The way the locals talk,
it makes me sick.

975
01:43:55,271 --> 01:43:58,440
But you live here
and you go to the church.

976
01:43:58,524 --> 01:44:02,193
Yes, but that don't mean
I don't look at things me own way.

977
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:04,195
Why don't you move then?

978
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:05,947
Your husband's dead.

979
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:10,744
You know very well
why I don't move.

980
01:44:10,828 --> 01:44:13,121
I don't move because of you.

981
01:44:14,665 --> 01:44:17,334
A woman has to choose
for herself, Bess.

982
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:20,337
She has to have
a mind of her own.

983
01:44:20,421 --> 01:44:23,465
Now, what you're doing is...
making things worse.

984
01:44:23,549 --> 01:44:25,967
It's... nonsense.
His... His head's full of scars.

985
01:44:26,052 --> 01:44:27,969
He's up to his eyeballs in drugs.

986
01:44:28,054 --> 01:44:30,055
He doesn't know what he's saying.

987
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:33,016
And he doesn't know.

988
01:44:37,897 --> 01:44:39,649
I'm sorry.

989
01:44:41,192 --> 01:44:42,901
I'm sorry.

990
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:48,239
Am I going to go to hell?

991
01:44:49,909 --> 01:44:52,452
Whom do you want to save?

992
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:54,871
Yourself or Jan?

993
01:44:58,501 --> 01:45:01,127
Bess?

994
01:45:02,213 --> 01:45:04,130
It's been a long time.

995
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:05,882
Most unlike you.

996
01:45:08,970 --> 01:45:14,224
I must warn you that the Lord
looks with anger upon those who fail him.

997
01:45:28,155 --> 01:45:31,157
You've got to lend me
something to wear.

998
01:45:41,877 --> 01:45:43,920
He's never gonna beat me.

999
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:09,112
You're low man.

1000
01:46:09,196 --> 01:46:11,114
All right, all right.

1001
01:46:20,666 --> 01:46:22,250
Hello.

1002
01:46:32,428 --> 01:46:34,429
How much, darlin'?

1003
01:46:44,774 --> 01:46:46,733
One, two, three.

1004
01:47:03,709 --> 01:47:06,586
Thank you.

1005
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:08,338
Okay.

1006
01:47:14,178 --> 01:47:16,554
I can't hear the blood pressure.

1007
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:18,306
I can't hear the blood pressure.

1008
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:20,683
We have a fibrillation.

1009
01:47:27,024 --> 01:47:28,983
Clear.

1010
01:47:29,068 --> 01:47:30,819
- Shit.
- No, there's no change.

1011
01:47:30,903 --> 01:47:33,071
Okay. Clear.

1012
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:39,994
- Clear again, please.
- Clear.

1013
01:47:41,372 --> 01:47:44,124
Come on.

1014
01:47:44,208 --> 01:47:46,042
Clear, please.

1015
01:47:47,419 --> 01:47:49,379
All right.

1016
01:47:49,463 --> 01:47:52,006
Yes. Good.

1017
01:47:54,552 --> 01:47:56,469
Good work.
Good work.

1018
01:47:56,554 --> 01:47:58,513
It's okay.

1019
01:48:15,865 --> 01:48:17,407
Hi, Bess.

1020
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:21,578
Bess?

1021
01:48:22,788 --> 01:48:23,997
Bess.

1022
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:26,666
Think it's time
we had a little chat.

1023
01:48:37,887 --> 01:48:41,764
I love you,
no matter what is in your head.

1024
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:06,206
So you didn't have to give Jan
electric shock treatment...

1025
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:09,209
when his heart stopped
in the operation yesterday?

1026
01:49:09,293 --> 01:49:10,793
No, we didn't.

1027
01:49:10,878 --> 01:49:13,796
It was a perfectly simple operation.
It went very well.

1028
01:49:13,881 --> 01:49:15,882
As you know.

1029
01:49:17,009 --> 01:49:18,927
I shouldn't have to say that.

1030
01:49:19,011 --> 01:49:21,012
You know that very well.

1031
01:49:25,643 --> 01:49:28,770
I want a word
with Bess on her own.

1032
01:49:33,901 --> 01:49:35,902
Thank you, Dorothy.

1033
01:49:37,738 --> 01:49:40,657
I'm not going to ask you
what you've been getting up to...

1034
01:49:40,741 --> 01:49:43,660
'cause I don't want
to hear you lie to me.

1035
01:49:43,744 --> 01:49:47,163
But as long as you are
living under my roof...

1036
01:49:47,248 --> 01:49:51,334
you are to behave like
a decent human being.

1037
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:53,378
I've never lied to you.

1038
01:49:53,462 --> 01:49:55,505
Do you understand me?

1039
01:49:58,801 --> 01:50:00,510
Yes, Mother.

1040
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:06,516
This is very painful for me.

1041
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:10,520
Your grandfather can no longer
hold his hand over you...

1042
01:50:10,604 --> 01:50:12,689
with the elders.

1043
01:50:12,773 --> 01:50:15,775
I don't think you realize
what that means.

1044
01:50:15,859 --> 01:50:19,570
Have you any idea
what it's like to be cast out?

1045
01:50:20,447 --> 01:50:22,782
You will have nothing, Bess.

1046
01:50:24,243 --> 01:50:26,160
I have known strong men
and women...

1047
01:50:26,245 --> 01:50:28,162
wither away after being cast out.

1048
01:50:28,247 --> 01:50:30,290
Now, you are not strong.

1049
01:50:30,374 --> 01:50:32,542
You're a feeble girl.

1050
01:50:34,169 --> 01:50:36,170
It would kill you, Bess.

1051
01:50:38,299 --> 01:50:40,300
I've said enough.

1052
01:50:55,733 --> 01:50:57,650
Bess?

1053
01:50:57,735 --> 01:51:00,987
Bess.
Could you come down a minute, love?

1054
01:51:04,616 --> 01:51:06,242
Dr. Richardson is here.

1055
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:09,329
Hi, Bess.

1056
01:51:10,331 --> 01:51:12,081
Hello.

1057
01:51:22,634 --> 01:51:25,762
Well, how are you?
Can we sit down?

1058
01:51:25,846 --> 01:51:27,972
Mmm.

1059
01:51:34,438 --> 01:51:36,105
Bess.

1060
01:51:38,525 --> 01:51:40,860
I th... I think you've
got yourself involved...

1061
01:51:40,944 --> 01:51:43,571
in something which is
out of your control.

1062
01:51:45,032 --> 01:51:46,699
Have I?

1063
01:51:50,287 --> 01:51:52,955
Come on, Bess.
You're not a kid anymore.

1064
01:51:54,291 --> 01:51:56,751
Look, for Christ's sake, he's...

1065
01:51:56,835 --> 01:51:59,754
he's forcing you to get screwed
by every Tom, Dick and Harry.

1066
01:51:59,838 --> 01:52:01,839
It's just not you.

1067
01:52:03,384 --> 01:52:05,635
I don't make love with them.

1068
01:52:07,221 --> 01:52:09,472
I make love with Jan...

1069
01:52:11,016 --> 01:52:13,726
and I save him from dying.

1070
01:52:19,691 --> 01:52:21,609
Well, I'm sorry, but, you know...

1071
01:52:21,693 --> 01:52:25,696
to me he seems more like a dirty old man
who wants to play the Peeping Tom.

1072
01:52:29,159 --> 01:52:30,827
Sometimes...

1073
01:52:32,121 --> 01:52:35,123
I don't even
have to tell him about it.

1074
01:52:37,918 --> 01:52:39,752
Jan and me...

1075
01:52:41,046 --> 01:52:43,673
we have a spiritual contact.

1076
01:52:51,348 --> 01:52:55,059
God gives everyone
something to be good at.

1077
01:52:58,522 --> 01:53:00,690
I've always been stupid...

1078
01:53:03,485 --> 01:53:05,736
but I'm good at this.

1079
01:53:10,576 --> 01:53:13,453
God gives everyone a talent.

1080
01:53:18,292 --> 01:53:20,334
What's Jan's talent?

1081
01:53:26,884 --> 01:53:28,593
He is...

1082
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:35,224
He's a great lover.

1083
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:39,395
Well, what's...
what's mine, then?

1084
01:53:40,063 --> 01:53:41,689
I don't know.

1085
01:53:42,691 --> 01:53:44,692
Haven't you found it yet?

1086
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:49,280
I see.

1087
01:53:50,741 --> 01:53:52,366
And what's your talent then, Bess?

1088
01:53:52,451 --> 01:53:55,203
Because, um, surely it can't be...

1089
01:53:55,287 --> 01:53:58,456
being screwed by men
you've never seen before.

1090
01:54:01,084 --> 01:54:03,085
I can believe.

1091
01:54:17,351 --> 01:54:18,935
Are you angry now?

1092
01:54:19,019 --> 01:54:20,436
Yes, I'm...

1093
01:54:20,521 --> 01:54:22,146
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I am angry...

1094
01:54:22,231 --> 01:54:24,649
because you can't see that
he's messing you about.

1095
01:54:24,733 --> 01:54:26,651
He's the one who's sick.

1096
01:54:26,735 --> 01:54:28,653
Look, what he's
doing to you is sick...

1097
01:54:28,737 --> 01:54:30,655
and it's getting
sicker and sicker.

1098
01:54:30,739 --> 01:54:34,492
He's becoming more and more of a danger
to you the more the fluid rises in his...

1099
01:54:34,576 --> 01:54:36,577
Listen to me, for God's sake!

1100
01:54:36,662 --> 01:54:38,579
Do you always get so involved...

1101
01:54:38,664 --> 01:54:41,874
in your patients' problems,
Dr. Richardson?

1102
01:54:41,959 --> 01:54:43,960
Listen to me, Bess.

1103
01:54:45,170 --> 01:54:47,171
I care for you.

1104
01:54:54,596 --> 01:54:56,597
I love you, Bess.

1105
01:54:58,517 --> 01:55:00,518
You're very special.

1106
01:55:07,192 --> 01:55:09,735
Will you move your hands, please.

1107
01:55:18,245 --> 01:55:19,829
Dodo.

1108
01:55:23,458 --> 01:55:26,794
Will you show
Dr. Richardson out, please?

1109
01:55:26,878 --> 01:55:29,797
What's...
What's gonna happen now then, Bess? Um...

1110
01:55:29,881 --> 01:55:32,300
Has he told you any more
of the thoughts he's had...

1111
01:55:32,384 --> 01:55:34,468
any more services
for you to perform?

1112
01:55:34,553 --> 01:55:36,470
Don't come here again.

1113
01:55:36,555 --> 01:55:38,472
Oh, he has, has he?
What's it gonna be this time?

1114
01:55:38,557 --> 01:55:40,891
What are you gonna give him
to slobber over this time?

1115
01:56:02,331 --> 01:56:04,457
Dear Father...

1116
01:56:04,541 --> 01:56:06,542
what's going on?

1117
01:56:44,623 --> 01:56:47,500
Father? Where are you?

1118
01:57:03,141 --> 01:57:07,311
We just don't want to wait
for someone like that.

1119
01:57:31,128 --> 01:57:32,670
Hello.

1120
01:57:35,132 --> 01:57:38,134
Can you take me
out to the ships?

1121
01:57:43,265 --> 01:57:46,642
Can't take you out there.
The other girls wouldn't like it.

1122
01:57:48,979 --> 01:57:52,356
They can't do all the ships.
They don't have time.

1123
01:57:52,441 --> 01:57:54,316
Maybe not.

1124
01:57:56,445 --> 01:57:58,404
Well, what about the big one?

1125
01:57:58,488 --> 01:58:03,492
I don't go out to that one anymore.
The girls won't go aboard.

1126
01:58:04,703 --> 01:58:07,705
Well, then you can take me,
and no harm done.

1127
01:58:13,587 --> 01:58:15,755
How are you feeling, Jan?

1128
01:58:17,174 --> 01:58:18,924
Well...

1129
01:58:19,009 --> 01:58:20,968
I've felt better.

1130
01:58:22,679 --> 01:58:24,096
Yeah. Yeah.

1131
01:58:24,181 --> 01:58:27,224
Unfortunately, the periods
in which we can get through to you...

1132
01:58:27,309 --> 01:58:29,310
have lately become very rare.

1133
01:58:30,729 --> 01:58:34,315
I have to send you back to Glasgow
for a while, I'm afraid.

1134
01:58:35,984 --> 01:58:37,985
I don't want any more...

1135
01:58:38,945 --> 01:58:41,197
operations.

1136
01:58:41,281 --> 01:58:45,409
Of course,
it's entirely up to you, but...

1137
01:58:45,494 --> 01:58:50,581
I have to say that your condition
is unlikely to improve without surgery.

1138
01:58:59,466 --> 01:59:02,468
Well, if you've made your mind up
on that point...

1139
01:59:04,054 --> 01:59:07,056
maybe it's time
to consider other matters.

1140
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:13,103
I mean, we should start thinking
about other people than just you.

1141
01:59:16,274 --> 01:59:18,067
Bess?

1142
01:59:19,736 --> 01:59:22,404
I'm glad you understand
what I'm driving at.

1143
01:59:25,659 --> 01:59:27,660
Your...
Your condition...

1144
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:30,871
has been...
has been very hard on her.

1145
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:35,626
I can't judge why, but she's...

1146
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:39,380
she's suffering from delusions
regarding your condition.

1147
01:59:42,217 --> 01:59:44,301
I have to be blunt.

1148
01:59:45,512 --> 01:59:48,097
I don't think that seeing you
is good for her.

1149
01:59:49,975 --> 01:59:51,517
I guess not.

1150
01:59:51,601 --> 01:59:55,980
And I'm convinced that the best thing
we can do for her right now...

1151
01:59:56,064 --> 01:59:58,607
is to admit her again.

1152
02:00:03,405 --> 02:00:05,155
Get her away?

1153
02:00:06,157 --> 02:00:07,741
Yes.

1154
02:00:08,827 --> 02:00:11,370
As far away as possible.

1155
02:00:12,998 --> 02:00:15,583
Think that's necessary?

1156
02:00:16,501 --> 02:00:19,378
Listen, if you don't want surgery...

1157
02:00:19,462 --> 02:00:22,381
the indications are that we will enter
a prolonged period...

1158
02:00:22,465 --> 02:00:25,467
in which you will be more and more
affected by your condition.

1159
02:00:26,845 --> 02:00:29,847
The poorlier you are...

1160
02:00:29,931 --> 02:00:33,642
the more detrimental
your influence on Bess.

1161
02:00:33,727 --> 02:00:37,271
I've drawn up some papers
giving me the authority to detain her...

1162
02:00:37,355 --> 02:00:40,316
under the provisions
of the Mental Health Act.

1163
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:44,653
I'll need your consent.

1164
02:00:45,822 --> 02:00:48,657
You're going to section Bess?

1165
02:00:48,742 --> 02:00:51,243
It's the only way
I can get her treated.

1166
02:01:11,514 --> 02:01:13,682
Tell me, Dr. Richardson.

1167
02:01:15,477 --> 02:01:18,646
Does this mean
I will never see her again?

1168
02:01:20,565 --> 02:01:22,566
To be realistic, yes.

1169
02:01:25,946 --> 02:01:28,530
Just there at the bottom.

1170
02:01:42,462 --> 02:01:45,130
You said you wanted to help her.

1171
02:01:47,425 --> 02:01:49,551
Come on, Jan.

02:03:34,657 --> 02:03:36,658
How do I get back?

1183
02:03:36,743 --> 02:03:38,911
I'll keep an eye out for you.

1184
02:04:06,648 --> 02:04:08,232
Hello.

1185
02:04:15,031 --> 02:04:17,032
What do you want?

1186
02:04:24,249 --> 02:04:27,251
I want that you do it
with the sailor and I watch.

1187
02:04:30,046 --> 02:04:31,839
Okay.

1188
02:04:39,472 --> 02:04:41,056
It's all right.

1189
02:04:48,189 --> 02:04:50,566
- All right. Come here, you.
- No.

1190
02:04:51,985 --> 02:04:56,029
There we go. Eh?

1191
02:04:56,114 --> 02:04:58,240
Yeah, that's better.

1192
02:05:00,326 --> 02:05:02,661
Come on now.

1193
02:05:03,913 --> 02:05:06,999
Yeah. That's right.
You like this, eh?

1194
02:05:07,083 --> 02:05:10,043
No. Please.
Can I go home now?

1195
02:05:10,128 --> 02:05:12,171
No, no.
Can I go home now, please?

1196
02:05:12,255 --> 02:05:14,464
- Stay still!
- No, please.

1197
02:05:14,549 --> 02:05:17,676
- No, no, please... Please, can I go home?
- Stay still, I said!

1198
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:20,971
Stay still, I said!

1199
02:05:21,055 --> 02:05:23,849
Stay... God's sake.

1200
02:05:28,938 --> 02:05:31,481
No!

1201
02:05:32,942 --> 02:05:34,568
You bitch!

1202
02:05:37,822 --> 02:05:39,489
I'm going to shoot you!

1203
02:05:39,574 --> 02:05:41,366
- You will?
- I'm gonna shoot you.

1204
02:05:41,451 --> 02:05:43,660
You think so?

1205
02:05:43,745 --> 02:05:46,914
You don't even know
how to use that thing.

1206
02:05:54,881 --> 02:05:57,090
Nobody will believe a hooker!

1207
02:06:05,683 --> 02:06:10,020
Because there is only one thing for us,
sinners that we are...

1208
02:06:10,104 --> 02:06:14,107
to achieve perfection
in the eyes of God...

1209
02:06:15,985 --> 02:06:21,406
through unconditional love
for the word that is written...

1210
02:06:21,491 --> 02:06:25,702
through unconditional love
for the law.

1211
02:06:31,709 --> 02:06:36,338
I don't understand
what you're saying.

1212
02:06:38,049 --> 02:06:39,633
How can you love...

1213
02:06:39,717 --> 02:06:41,802
a word?

1214
02:06:44,013 --> 02:06:47,557
You cannot love words.

1215
02:06:48,601 --> 02:06:51,853
You cannot be in love with a word.

1216
02:06:53,231 --> 02:06:57,901
You can love another human being.

1217
02:07:01,364 --> 02:07:03,573
That's perfection.

1218
02:07:03,658 --> 02:07:05,158
No woman speaks here!

1219
02:07:05,243 --> 02:07:07,494
Bess McNeill, the kirk session...

1220
02:07:07,578 --> 02:07:09,955
- has decided this day...
- No, let me stay here.

1221
02:07:10,039 --> 02:07:13,834
that henceforth you shall no longer
have access to this kirk.

1222
02:07:13,918 --> 02:07:17,004
- They who know you shall not know you.
- Please let me stay!

1223
02:07:17,088 --> 02:07:18,588
Please. No.

1224
02:07:18,673 --> 02:07:21,967
Begone, Bess McNeill,
from the house of God!

1225
02:07:46,075 --> 02:07:48,952
Hello, Bess. You're...
You're coming with us.

1226
02:07:49,037 --> 02:07:50,662
We're going to Glasgow.

1227
02:07:50,747 --> 02:07:53,957
Bess, they're going to take you
back into hospital just for a little bit.

1228
02:07:54,042 --> 02:07:56,001
It's for your own good.

1229
02:07:56,085 --> 02:07:58,545
I want to see Jan.
I want to see my husband.

1230
02:07:58,629 --> 02:08:00,964
I know.
But not now, Bess.

1231
02:08:01,049 --> 02:08:03,633
It's for your own good, Bess.

1232
02:08:03,718 --> 02:08:07,387
Mother can't have me admitted,
not now that I'm married.

1233
02:08:07,472 --> 02:08:11,350
Bess, it wasn't Mother
that signed the paper.

1234
02:08:11,434 --> 02:08:13,101
It was Jan.

1235
02:08:15,188 --> 02:08:17,522
- You liar!
- Come along, Bess.

1236
02:08:17,607 --> 02:08:19,530
Jan!

1237
02:08:19,609 --> 02:08:22,069
Jan!

1238
02:08:22,153 --> 02:08:24,863
Dodo, how can you do this?

1239
02:08:24,947 --> 02:08:27,366
You had a husband too once.

1240
02:08:27,450 --> 02:08:30,619
Your love could've saved him,
if only you'd tried.

1241
02:08:30,703 --> 02:08:32,296
Jan!

1242
02:08:34,123 --> 02:08:35,749
Jan!

1243
02:09:08,991 --> 02:09:10,992
Okay, Bess, let's go.

1244
02:09:12,453 --> 02:09:14,079
Oh, fuck.

1245
02:09:15,081 --> 02:09:17,499
Ryan. She's no here.

1246
02:09:30,012 --> 02:09:31,596
Hello.

1247
02:09:45,486 --> 02:09:47,070
Who's a tart?

1248
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:52,534
What you doing?

1249
02:10:07,175 --> 02:10:08,633
Who's a tart?

1250
02:10:08,718 --> 02:10:10,886
Who's a tart?

1251
02:10:22,648 --> 02:10:24,566
I can't open the door!

1252
02:10:24,650 --> 02:10:26,234
Please.

1253
02:10:26,319 --> 02:10:28,403
Mother?

1254
02:10:30,323 --> 02:10:31,823
Please.

1255
02:10:31,908 --> 02:10:35,202
Please, Mother!
Open the door!

1256
02:10:37,413 --> 02:10:39,289
Please open the d...

1257
02:10:43,044 --> 02:10:45,295
Mother!

1258
02:10:45,379 --> 02:10:46,963
I'll be good.

1259
02:10:47,048 --> 02:10:49,508
I'll be really, really good.

1260
02:10:49,592 --> 02:10:51,718
I'll be really good.

1261
02:10:51,802 --> 02:10:53,803
Please help.

1262
02:11:14,116 --> 02:11:16,201
Would you please go away?

1263
02:11:18,329 --> 02:11:20,789
Stop it! Go away!

1264
02:11:20,873 --> 02:11:23,667
You just go away
and leave me!

1265
02:11:41,769 --> 02:11:43,853
Who's a tart?

1266
02:12:00,580 --> 02:12:02,163
Away with you!

1267
02:12:02,248 --> 02:12:05,500
Stop all this racket
outside the house of God.

1268
02:12:07,003 --> 02:12:09,045
Go on! On you go!

1269
02:12:56,218 --> 02:12:58,219
What's happened?

1270
02:12:59,347 --> 02:13:01,681
Bess. Bess?

1271
02:13:03,351 --> 02:13:05,769
Bess. Are you all right, love?

1272
02:13:05,853 --> 02:13:08,480
Bess? It's Dodo.

1273
02:13:08,564 --> 02:13:10,565
Oh, Bess.

1274
02:13:14,779 --> 02:13:16,451
Mmm.

1275
02:13:21,285 --> 02:13:23,244
Mmm.

1276
02:13:27,583 --> 02:13:29,292
Jan is dying.

1277
02:13:32,713 --> 02:13:34,923
I-I wasn't to tell you.

1278
02:13:41,931 --> 02:13:44,224
- I wasn't to tell you.
- No.

1279
02:13:44,308 --> 02:13:47,143
It's good you told me.

1280
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:58,446
I know you love me.

1281
02:14:10,793 --> 02:14:12,794
I have to go.

1282
02:14:15,881 --> 02:14:18,800
- Is there anything I can do for you?
- No.

1283
02:14:18,884 --> 02:14:20,552
Anything at all?

1284
02:14:25,808 --> 02:14:27,726
Yes.

1285
02:14:27,810 --> 02:14:31,438
I'd like you to go to Jan
and pray for him to be cured...

1286
02:14:31,522 --> 02:14:33,898
and to rise from his bed
and walk.

1287
02:14:58,966 --> 02:15:01,384
Will you take me to the big ship?

1288
02:15:01,469 --> 02:15:02,927
Again?

1289
02:15:03,012 --> 02:15:04,679
Are you sure?

1290
02:15:16,650 --> 02:15:19,402
Father, why aren't you with me?

1291
02:15:29,079 --> 02:15:31,331
I am with you, Bess.

1292
02:15:31,415 --> 02:15:33,958
What do you want from me?

1293
02:15:38,047 --> 02:15:40,048
Where were you?

1294
02:15:42,009 --> 02:15:46,513
Well, don't you think I have other people
who want to talk to me?

1295
02:15:46,597 --> 02:15:49,140
Oh, of course.

1296
02:15:49,225 --> 02:15:51,559
I hadn't thought of that.

1297
02:15:53,062 --> 02:15:55,522
There's this silly little thing
called Bess...

1298
02:15:55,606 --> 02:15:57,982
who keeps on wanting me
to talk to her...

1299
02:15:58,067 --> 02:16:01,361
so my work's been piling up a bit.

1300
02:16:03,781 --> 02:16:05,907
But you're with me now?

1301
02:16:08,244 --> 02:16:10,912
Of course I am, Bess.

1302
02:16:10,996 --> 02:16:13,081
You know that.

1303
02:16:22,091 --> 02:16:23,716
Thank you.

1304
02:17:03,215 --> 02:17:05,550
I'm sorry.
Do you need me?

1305
02:17:05,634 --> 02:17:07,802
No, no, that's all right.
Stay there.

1306
02:17:09,805 --> 02:17:12,223
Bess asked me to pray.

1307
02:17:12,308 --> 02:17:14,142
For what?

1308
02:17:14,226 --> 02:17:15,810
For Jan's life.

1309
02:17:19,064 --> 02:17:20,940
For a miracle.

1310
02:17:23,694 --> 02:17:26,279
Yeah, that would be a miracle.

1311
02:17:37,625 --> 02:17:39,250
Dear God...

1312
02:17:40,252 --> 02:17:42,253
I pray that Jan gets better...

1313
02:17:42,338 --> 02:17:45,590
that he rises from his bed
and walks.

1314
02:17:59,313 --> 02:18:01,314
Sister McNeill here.

1315
02:18:05,611 --> 02:18:08,154
Where's Jan?
I'd like to see him.

1316
02:18:08,238 --> 02:18:11,366
No, not now, love.
You're gonna have an operation now.

1317
02:18:11,450 --> 02:18:12,951
I want to see him.

1318
02:18:13,035 --> 02:18:14,702
Not now.
You need an operation.

1319
02:18:14,787 --> 02:18:17,455
No, I've got to see Jan.

1320
02:18:17,539 --> 02:18:19,791
Please, Dodo.

1321
02:18:19,875 --> 02:18:22,293
All right.
All right, stop.

1322
02:18:22,378 --> 02:18:25,630
She wants to see Jan.
I'm gonna take her to see Jan.

1323
02:18:25,714 --> 02:18:29,217
Come on. Out the way, for God's sake.
Help me. Come on.

1324
02:18:31,303 --> 02:18:33,596
Move, for Christ's sake!

1325
02:18:34,473 --> 02:18:36,724
All right. All right.

1326
02:18:36,809 --> 02:18:39,227
Here you go.
There you are.

1327
02:18:39,311 --> 02:18:41,813
You can see him now, can't you?

1328
02:18:41,897 --> 02:18:43,690
How's he...

1329
02:18:45,359 --> 02:18:47,026
How's he doing?

1330
02:18:48,904 --> 02:18:51,072
He's...

1331
02:18:51,156 --> 02:18:53,908
Is he not any better?

1332
02:18:53,993 --> 02:18:56,327
No. No, he's not.

1333
02:18:56,412 --> 02:18:57,954
Oh.

1334
02:18:59,289 --> 02:19:02,458
I thought he might be better now.

1335
02:19:04,962 --> 02:19:07,338
Hmm.

1336
02:19:07,423 --> 02:19:11,300
Maybe I was wrong after all.

1337
02:19:11,385 --> 02:19:12,927
Hmm.

1338
02:19:15,055 --> 02:19:17,098
Okay, let's get her inside.

1339
02:19:19,601 --> 02:19:21,144
- Take those.
- Yeah.

1340
02:19:21,228 --> 02:19:22,812
Okay.

1341
02:19:23,939 --> 02:19:25,440
Take care. Let's go.

1342
02:19:25,524 --> 02:19:27,942
One, two, three.

1343
02:19:28,027 --> 02:19:29,861
There we go.

1344
02:19:34,283 --> 02:19:35,910
Okay.

1345
02:19:35,993 --> 02:19:37,702
Okay.

1346
02:19:37,786 --> 02:19:39,287
It's all right, love.

1347
02:19:39,371 --> 02:19:41,581
Hi, Bess. Do you know me?

1348
02:19:41,665 --> 02:19:43,291
Pulse, 90.

1349
02:19:46,503 --> 02:19:48,254
Okay.

1350
02:19:48,338 --> 02:19:50,798
- What happened? Do you know?
- No.

1351
02:19:51,925 --> 02:19:54,510
- Pressure, 100.
- Okay.

1352
02:19:54,595 --> 02:19:56,554
- Blood pressure?
- 100.

1353
02:19:56,638 --> 02:19:59,390
You'll be all right, love.
You'll be all right.

1354
02:19:59,475 --> 02:20:02,393
I'm just gonna have a look
at her back. There we go.

1355
02:20:02,478 --> 02:20:04,604
Okay. Give me the scissors.

1356
02:20:04,688 --> 02:20:06,814
- Yes.
- All right.

1357
02:20:06,899 --> 02:20:08,900
Mother.

1358
02:20:08,984 --> 02:20:11,360
Mother.

1359
02:20:12,821 --> 02:20:14,947
Here she is.

1360
02:20:15,032 --> 02:20:17,200
Oh, Bessie.

1361
02:20:18,494 --> 02:20:20,495
Bess.

1362
02:20:20,579 --> 02:20:23,664
I'm sorry that I could not
be good, Mother.

1363
02:20:24,416 --> 02:20:26,250
It's all right, Bessie.

1364
02:20:30,380 --> 02:20:32,673
Your grandfather's...

1365
02:20:32,758 --> 02:20:34,759
sorry he couldn't come.

1366
02:20:38,514 --> 02:20:41,891
Will you tell him
that I love him?

1367
02:20:45,354 --> 02:20:47,146
I'm glad...

1368
02:20:47,231 --> 02:20:49,732
that you came, Mother.

1369
02:20:52,694 --> 02:20:54,195
Blood pressure?

1370
02:20:54,279 --> 02:20:55,780
Yeah.

1371
02:20:55,864 --> 02:20:57,365
- It's going down.
- Right.

1372
02:20:57,449 --> 02:21:00,034
- Two units now. Two units. Immediately.
- Two units.

1373
02:21:00,119 --> 02:21:02,745
We're just gonna lower you down a bit now.
All right, love?

1374
02:21:02,830 --> 02:21:04,330
Take her head.

1375
02:21:04,414 --> 02:21:05,873
There we go.

1376
02:21:05,958 --> 02:21:07,750
- That was easy, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

1377
02:21:07,835 --> 02:21:09,669
Yeah. Gonna be all right.

1378
02:21:09,753 --> 02:21:11,671
Oh, Do...

1379
02:21:11,755 --> 02:21:14,340
Dodo, h-hold me.

1380
02:21:14,424 --> 02:21:16,717
Yeah, I'm holding you.

1381
02:21:16,802 --> 02:21:20,054
- It's all right, love. I'm here. I'm here.
- I'm... I'm afraid.

1382
02:21:20,139 --> 02:21:22,557
I know... I know you are.

1383
02:21:24,560 --> 02:21:26,144
Jan?

1384
02:21:27,688 --> 02:21:30,565
Jan.

1385
02:21:30,649 --> 02:21:32,817
Shh, now. Shush.

1386
02:21:32,901 --> 02:21:35,444
I'm frightened.

1387
02:21:36,405 --> 02:21:38,114
It's...

1388
02:21:38,198 --> 02:21:40,116
It's all wrong.

1389
02:21:42,911 --> 02:21:44,495
No pulse.

1390
02:21:44,580 --> 02:21:45,746
Bess?

1391
02:21:45,831 --> 02:21:47,790
Stand clear. Stand clear.

1392
02:21:47,875 --> 02:21:49,500
Clear! Clear!

1393
02:21:58,552 --> 02:22:00,636
It's gonna be all right.

1394
02:22:08,103 --> 02:22:10,563
That's a good girl.
Come on.

1395
02:22:14,109 --> 02:22:16,611
- Okay, you can stop now.
- Wh-Wh... What do you mean?

1396
02:22:16,695 --> 02:22:18,279
She's gone, Dodo. She's gone.

1397
02:22:20,282 --> 02:22:21,949
She's gone.

1398
02:22:23,202 --> 02:22:25,703
- No.
- She's gone.

1399
02:22:25,787 --> 02:22:27,663
No.

1400
02:22:27,748 --> 02:22:29,999
Bess. Bess.

1401
02:22:30,083 --> 02:22:31,667
Listen to me.

1402
02:22:35,964 --> 02:22:38,090
I'm sorry.

1403
02:22:43,096 --> 02:22:45,473
I'm... I'm sorry.

1404
02:22:45,557 --> 02:22:48,142
Dodo.

1405
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:52,021
Come on.

1406
02:22:52,105 --> 02:22:54,482
Come on, Dodo. Let's go.

1407
02:22:54,566 --> 02:22:56,067

You have described
the deceased as...

1430
02:24:28,952 --> 02:24:32,330
"an immature, unstable person...

1431
02:24:32,414 --> 02:24:36,375
"a person who, due to the trauma
of her husband's illness...

1432
02:24:36,460 --> 02:24:38,377
"gave way in obsessive fashion...

1433
02:24:38,462 --> 02:24:43,466
"to an exaggerated,
perverse form of sexuality."

1434
02:24:45,719 --> 02:24:48,846
Would you like to clarify that
to the inquiry?

1435
02:24:48,930 --> 02:24:50,848
Uh, that's what I wrote.

1436
02:24:55,103 --> 02:24:58,064
Yes, that's...
that's what it says.

1437
02:24:59,941 --> 02:25:02,151
Can I have a glass of water, please?

1438
02:25:03,111 --> 02:25:05,905
Get Dr. Richardson
a glass of water.

1439
02:25:10,160 --> 02:25:11,744
Thank you.

1440
02:25:13,288 --> 02:25:18,376
Listen, man,
you had the deceased in your care.

1441
02:25:18,460 --> 02:25:22,046
The court would like
to hear the medical facts.

1442
02:25:25,300 --> 02:25:27,051
If... If you'd, um...

1443
02:25:27,135 --> 02:25:30,554
If you were to ask me
again to write...

1444
02:25:30,639 --> 02:25:32,848
um...

1445
02:25:32,933 --> 02:25:35,142
the conclusion, then...

1446
02:25:37,396 --> 02:25:40,189
in-instead of writing "neurotic"...

1447
02:25:40,273 --> 02:25:43,192
or, um, "psychotic"...

1448
02:25:43,276 --> 02:25:46,028
uh, I might...

1449
02:25:46,113 --> 02:25:48,030
just, um...

1450
02:25:48,115 --> 02:25:50,157
use a word like...

1451
02:25:52,285 --> 02:25:53,953
"good."

1452
02:25:57,374 --> 02:25:59,041
Good?

1453
02:26:00,293 --> 02:26:01,836
Yes.

1454
02:26:04,339 --> 02:26:07,007
You wish the records
of this court...

1455
02:26:07,092 --> 02:26:11,303
to state that
in your medical opinion...

1456
02:26:12,472 --> 02:26:15,516
the deceased was suffering
from being good?

1457
02:26:18,728 --> 02:26:24,108
Perhaps this was the psychological defect
that led to her death.

1458
02:26:26,236 --> 02:26:29,238
Is that what we shall write,
Dr. Richardson?

1459
02:26:32,701 --> 02:26:36,203
No. Of course not.

1460
02:26:38,039 --> 02:26:40,666
Very well then.

1461
02:26:40,750 --> 02:26:45,129
Perhaps we should stick to your
original statement then, Doctor?

1462
02:26:45,213 --> 02:26:46,881
Yes.

1463
02:26:50,343 --> 02:26:53,637
I think that everything there is to say
about Bess McNeill...

1464
02:26:53,722 --> 02:26:56,140
has been said already.

1465
02:26:56,224 --> 02:27:00,186
We have agreed
to sanction her burial...

1466
02:27:00,270 --> 02:27:04,148
but there can be
no funeral service.

1467
02:27:04,232 --> 02:27:07,735
The fact that some of us knew
the deceased girl well...

1468
02:27:07,819 --> 02:27:10,529
cannot be allowed to influence...

1469
02:27:10,614 --> 02:27:13,824
the form of her burial.

1470
02:27:13,909 --> 02:27:16,994
Bess McNeill's funeral
must be the same...

1471
02:27:17,078 --> 02:27:20,289
as anyone else of her kind.

1472
02:27:20,373 --> 02:27:25,044
The body will be released
by the authorities sometime this week.

1473
02:27:27,756 --> 02:27:31,759
I have obtained permission
from the elders to bury Bess...

1474
02:27:33,136 --> 02:27:35,012
but...

1475
02:27:35,096 --> 02:27:39,433
I cannot deviate from the principles
that apply to funerals here.

1476
02:27:41,937 --> 02:27:45,147
I must say about Bess
what must be said.

1477
02:28:21,309 --> 02:28:22,893
Okay, come on.

1478
02:28:49,504 --> 02:28:52,423
Where's Jan?
Has he gone down there yet?

1479
02:28:52,507 --> 02:28:54,717
Don't know. No.

1480
02:29:00,223 --> 02:29:02,391
- Have you seen Jan?
- No.

1481
02:29:28,877 --> 02:29:33,255
Bess McNeill,
you are a sinner...

1482
02:29:33,340 --> 02:29:37,509
and for your sins
you are consigned to hell.

1483
02:29:40,555 --> 02:29:42,473
Not one of you...

1484
02:29:42,557 --> 02:29:46,018
has the right
to consign Bess to hell.

1485
02:30:36,695 --> 02:30:39,780
Terry, it's time.

1486
02:30:45,203 --> 02:30:46,870
Let's do it.

1487
02:30:51,209 --> 02:30:53,711
Get up, for Christ's sake!

1488
02:31:45,221 --> 02:31:46,847
Come on, man.

1489
02:31:51,770 --> 02:31:53,353
Come on.

1490
02:32:31,142 --> 02:32:33,310
Take good care of her.

1491
02:32:50,912 --> 02:32:54,164
Come on, Jan.
You gotta let her go.

1492
02:33:15,436 --> 02:33:16,979
Bess!

1493
02:33:21,192 --> 02:33:22,776
Jan.

1494
02:33:23,903 --> 02:33:26,321
- Jan. Hey.
- What's the matter?

1495
02:33:26,406 --> 02:33:28,740
Come on. Come on.
I want to show you something.

1496
02:33:28,825 --> 02:33:31,034
- You're not gonna believe it.
- What?

1497
02:33:31,119 --> 02:33:32,619
Come on.

1498
02:33:32,704 --> 02:33:35,664
- Let me go. Please.
- Here. Let's go.

1499
02:33:35,748 --> 02:33:38,709
Pim!
Pim, come on!

1500
02:33:38,793 --> 02:33:41,795
You're not gonna believe it.

1501
02:33:44,007 --> 02:33:46,300
Hey, Pim.
Come on and check this out.

1502
02:33:49,721 --> 02:33:51,638
Check this thing out, man.

1503
02:33:51,723 --> 02:33:53,390
Do you see anything?

1504
02:33:54,893 --> 02:33:56,643
There's nothing out there.

1505
02:33:56,728 --> 02:33:59,688
I've tried all the fucking ranges,
and there's nothing there.

1506
02:33:59,772 --> 02:34:01,773
I just wanted to be sure.
Come on!
