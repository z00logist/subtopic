1
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,937
Dogville was in the Rocky Mountains
in the US of A.

2
00:00:44,354 --> 00:00:50,860
Up here where the road came to its
definiteve end near the entrance to the old,
abandoned silver mine.

3
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:56,991
The residents of Dogville were good,
honest folks and they liked their township.

4
00:00:57,116 --> 00:01:02,371
And while a sentimental soul from the East Coast
had once dubbed their main street ELM STREET,

5
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:05,499
though no elm tree had ever
cast its shadow in Dogville,

6
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:09,003
they saw no reason to change anything.

7
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:15,009
Most of the buildings were pretty wretched;
more like shacks; frankly.

8
00:01:15,217 --> 00:01:18,428
The house in which Tome lived
was the best, though,

9
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:23,308
and in good times might almost
have passed for presentable.

10
00:01:23,558 --> 00:01:27,646
That afternoon the radio was playing softly,

11
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:35,904
for in his dotage Thomas Edison Senior
had developed a weakness for music of the lighter kind.

12
00:01:36,738 --> 00:01:41,534
[Radio Presenter] Ladies and Gentlemen...
the President of the United States...

13
00:01:42,243 --> 00:01:45,997
Tom, do me a favor, will you?
The radio!?

14
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:50,626
Just because the music's over and
you might risk hearing something useful?

15
00:01:51,627 --> 00:01:54,213
I thought that's why we have the radio...

16
00:01:54,588 --> 00:01:57,007
Well, I need a rest, as you know.

17
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,052
Mock me if you like.

18
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:05,557
[Narrator] Tom's father had been a doctor
and now received a modest pension,

19
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:11,396
so it was no great disaster for Tom
to drift about not doing anything in particular.

20
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:16,192
Tom was a writer.
...at any rate by his own lights.

21
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:22,907
Oh, his output as committed to paper
was so far limited to the words "great" and "small",

22
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:25,034
followed by question mark,

23
00:02:25,076 --> 00:02:31,082
but nevertheless meticulously archived
in one of his many bureau drawers.

24
00:02:32,124 --> 00:02:33,292
'Bye, Dad.

25
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:40,049
Evenin' Master Tom.

26
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,134
Good evening, Master Olivia.

27
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:43,969
Don't forget about the meeting tomorrow.

28
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:45,220
Noooo

29
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:56,106
[Narrator] In order to postpone the time
at which he would have to put pen to pater in earnest,

30
00:02:56,147 --> 00:03:01,110
Tom had now come up with
a series of meetings on moral rearmament

31
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:04,614
with which he felt obliged to benefit the town.

32
00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:06,699
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Tom.

33
00:03:07,492 --> 00:03:08,868
Good evening Chuck.

34
00:03:09,243 --> 00:03:11,829
Will we see you at the meeting tomorrow?

35
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:14,331
Well, I could do without your lectures.

36
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:15,958
You know Vera.

37
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,461
Wouldn't give me moment's peace
till I said yes.

38
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:25,175
Who gave Moses that bone?
It's still got meat on it.

39
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:27,094
Jason did.

40
00:03:27,177 --> 00:03:29,763
Jason gave that mutt a bone
with meat on it?

41
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:33,016
When did we last see meat?

42
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:36,645
Next time you waste good food,
I'll take your knife away.

43
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:38,605
I would know it was you give'n meat to eat.

44
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,691
Moses was meant to be hungry! To keep watch.

45
00:03:41,774 --> 00:03:43,860
Keep watch in Dogville?

46
00:03:44,277 --> 00:03:46,404
What's there to steal?

47
00:03:46,446 --> 00:03:48,990
These are wicked time, Tom Edison.

48
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:52,785
Soon there'll be folks by
with even less than us.

49
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:04,338
[Narrator] Indeed..Tom was busy enough,
even though, formally speaking,

50
00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:07,674
not yet busy with writing per se.

51
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:12,304
And if a body found it hard to grasp
what profession he was busy at,

52
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:15,348
he'd merely reply "mining".

53
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:18,435
For although he did not blast
his way through rock,

54
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:21,104
he blasted through what was even harder...

55
00:04:21,771 --> 00:04:26,526
namely, the human soul...
right into where it glistered!

56
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,112
- Hey, Martha.
- Hello, Tom.

57
00:04:29,278 --> 00:04:31,948
Listen, they're all comin',
so you just have those benches ready.

58
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:33,616
Yes, they're ready.

59
00:04:33,616 --> 00:04:37,244
Oh, but Tom, I repeat,
if you need to use my organ

60
00:04:37,286 --> 00:04:40,206
I got to get special permission
from the regional director, Tom.

61
00:04:40,206 --> 00:04:43,334
Martha, and I repeat,
we don't need the organ.

62
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:46,837
We can be spiritual without singing
or reading from the Bible.

63
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:50,215
It's almost seven.
Don't forget your bell now.

64
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:54,094
I imagine that'll do Ma Ginger.

65
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:57,722
I don't think it's good for the soil
with all the raking and hoeing.

66
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:01,476
It's the soil that gave life to us all.

67
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:05,438
Don't give me any of your lip,
Thomas Edison Jr.

68
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,107
I'll hoe as I darn well please!

69
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:12,612
Yeah, and spoil the whole thing!
I agree with Tom.

70
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:15,031
Yeah, well he likes eating my pies,
don't you?

71
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,867
Well they're tasty.
No doubt about it.

72
00:05:17,992 --> 00:05:20,953
Yeah. So when it comes to hoeing,
who's right, Tom, you or me?

73
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:23,122
I'm not so sure it's that simple.

74
00:05:23,164 --> 00:05:24,999
He's got you there Ginger.

75
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:28,127
You can not resist,
can you, Gloria?

76
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:30,546
Hey, Ben, I'll get the doors!

77
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:31,755
I'll be fine, Tom.

78
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,258
Any news from the freight industry?

79
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:36,343
Is everything going to hell there too?

80
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:39,471
Don't poke fun at the freight industry.

81
00:05:44,184 --> 00:05:48,563
[Narrator] It was seven o'clock precisely,
as Martha chimed the hour,

82
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:53,693
and Tom was due to play checkers
with his childhood friend Bill Henson.

83
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,529
Bill was dumb and knew it.

84
00:05:57,155 --> 00:06:02,618
Far too dumb to qualify as an engineer,
he was certainly sure of that.

85
00:06:02,993 --> 00:06:11,085
After listening for a while to the piledriver
down the valley that Ben insisted was working
on the foundation of a new penitentiary,

86
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,047
Tom headed for the Henson home
in order to inflict upon Bill

87
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,842
yet another humiliating defeat at checkers.

88
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:27,017
Some folks might say the opportunity
to meet Bill's older sister, Liz, was more of a draw
than the checkerboard,

89
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:29,394
and they might be right.

90
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:34,565
It was a fact that in the Henson home
lay another horizon.

91
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:39,278
A horizon just as alluring
as the one beyond the valley.

92
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:44,241
A horizon bound by Liz Henson's
luscious curves.

93
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:49,163
- No one's getting it? 
- A sweet, painful, seductive abyss.

94
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:50,956
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey, Tom.

95
00:06:50,998 --> 00:06:55,085
Must you come by every single day?
Huh!?

96
00:06:55,127 --> 00:06:58,297
It'd be a lot more fun if someone
interesting appeared for a change.

97
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:02,092
You know I really am so lonesome in this town.

98
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:07,305
The moment my fiancee writes
that he's gotten that job in Bolder, I'm off.

99
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:10,558
Then the whole lot of you will
have to find some other girls' skirts to peek up.

100
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,685
Is.. uh.. Bill in?

101
00:07:13,186 --> 00:07:15,396
Well, isn't he always?

102
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:18,441
He studies and I help out with the glasses.

103
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:21,444
Even though everybody knows
that I'm the clever one.

104
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:24,655
- Hey, Mrs. Henson.
- Good evening, Tom.

105
00:07:25,031 --> 00:07:27,950
Checkers time, Bill ol' Buddy.

106
00:07:29,702 --> 00:07:30,995
Was that..??

107
00:07:31,412 --> 00:07:33,580
You didn't hear the bell?

108
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:39,461
[Narrator] As usual Bill tried to fake
his way around actually playing.

109
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:44,466
He had not yet fully comprehend
this meeting business, he claimed.

110
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,302
Maybe you should just let them be?

111
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:48,970
I don't think so... I... I...

112
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:51,514
What if they're just fine as they are?

113
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:54,309
You think they're fine?
I don't think so.

114
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,477
I think there is a lot
this country has forgotten.

115
00:07:56,561 --> 00:08:00,481
I just try and refresh folk's memory
by way of illustration.

116
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,608
So... so the illustration for tomorrow?

117
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:05,069
mmmh.. I don't know.

118
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:10,491
See if the people of Dogville have
a problem with the acceptance.

119
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:14,161
What they really need is something
for them to accept,

120
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:18,123
something tangible,
like a gift.

121
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,586
Why in the heck would someone
up and give us a gift?

122
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,046
I don't know.

123
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,214
I might have to do some thinking.

124
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:33,596
Wait, wait, .. the ...
we're missing a piece.

125
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,141
We won't be able to play.

126
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:48,903
My mind is sharp tonight.

127
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,831
'Night, Bill.

128
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:19,849
[Narrator] Despite considerable effort
on his part to prolong things,

129
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:23,728
Tom had achieved the triumph
at the checkerboard pretty quickly.

130
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:27,940
It had started to rain and
the wind had become a regular gale

131
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,068
when Tom strolled home through Elm Street.

132
00:09:31,777 --> 00:09:38,200
If Tom were to prove that the citizens of Dogville
had a problem receiving in his lecture in the next day

133
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:42,704
he sorely lacked an illustration,
a gift.

134
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:44,957
Bill might have been right.

135
00:09:44,998 --> 00:09:49,670
It hadn't exactly rained gifts 
on this particular township.

136
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:30,250
There was no doubt in his mind.

137
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:32,544
They were gun shots.

138
00:10:32,753 --> 00:10:36,673
The pile driver in the marshes
didn't sound like that at all.

139
00:10:36,756 --> 00:10:38,967
The shots had come from down in the valley,

140
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:43,179
or perhaps from Canyon Road some place
in the direction of Georgetown.

141
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:51,521
He listened for more shots for ages.
But they were not repeated.

142
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:59,111
A tad disappointed, Tom sat down
on the old lady's bench to think,

143
00:10:59,153 --> 00:11:02,823
to hang onto the feeling of danger
for a moment.

144
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:08,829
But it wasn't long before his thoughts
were back on his favorite subjects again,

145
00:11:08,954 --> 00:11:15,001
and in the midst of the storm they metamorphosed
into articles and novels and great gatherings

146
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:23,468
that'd listen in silence to Tom after the publication
of yet another volume that scourged and purged the human soul.

147
00:11:23,968 --> 00:11:27,847
And he saw men,
and among them even other writers,

148
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:34,687
throw their arms round one another as,
through his words, life had opened up for them anew.

149
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:37,231
It hadn't been easy.

150
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:44,321
But by his diligence and application
to narrative and drama his message had gotten through,

151
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:49,868
and asked about his technique he would
have to say but one word:

152
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:52,913
"illustration".

153
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,726
Tom could have spent another
half hour or more on the bench,

154
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:19,563
but another unusual noise roused him.

155
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:22,233
It was Moses barking.

156
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:27,404
Oh, that wasn't unusual in itself,
but it was the way he barked that was new.

157
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:31,033
His barking was not loud,
but more of a snarl,

158
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:37,456
as if the danger was quite close at hand
and not merely a passing raccoon or fox.

159
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:44,754
as if the dog were standing face to face
with a force to be taken seriously.

160
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:51,052
Hey, Lady!
I wouldn't go up there if I were you.

161
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:58,184
I know the mountain well,
I doubt if I'd get away with my life.

162
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:00,186
It's a very nasty drop.

163
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:08,360
Is there another way?

164
00:13:09,153 --> 00:13:10,195
Yeah.

165
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:15,367
Where?

166
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:20,539
Back down the way you came from.
Back down to Georgetown.

167
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:23,625
Why do you need to get out of the mountain?

168
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:26,962
Did you have anything to do
with those gunshots?

169
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:35,303
Help me, help me please.

170
00:13:35,303 --> 00:13:37,889
You can hide in the mine,
in there!

171
00:13:47,022 --> 00:13:48,607
Hey, where's this road headed to?

172
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:50,818
No where. It's a dead end.

173
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:55,239
If you want to pass, turn around,
go back by way of Georgetown.

174
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,158
This place... uh..
it's called Dogville.

175
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,703
Dogville? Well it figures,
it's a stupid name if I ever heard one.

176
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:04,790
Hey, we're looking for somebody...

177
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:06,791
Oh, really, who might that be?

178
00:14:08,877 --> 00:14:11,337
My boss wants to talk to ya.

179
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:13,715
- Young man.
- Yes, sir.

180
00:14:14,048 --> 00:14:20,012
I'm looking for a girl. She may have made
her way to your town in her confusion.

181
00:14:20,012 --> 00:14:25,059
I don't want any harm to come to her.
You see, she's very precious to me.

182
00:14:25,101 --> 00:14:28,521
Well sir, uh..
nobody's been through Dogville recently.

183
00:14:28,562 --> 00:14:32,441
Moses would have barked.
He's very suspicious of strangers.

184
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:36,695
Ah ha.. That's very wise Moses.

185
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:43,869
Please take my card and if perhaps..
uh.. you see a stranger,

186
00:14:43,952 --> 00:14:45,662
give me a call.

187
00:14:45,954 --> 00:14:49,958
I am in a position to offer
a considerable reward.

188
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,961
Yes sir. Thank you.

189
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:56,881
uh.. say was it you that fired those shots?

190
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:16,650
Well they're gone.
You want to come out now?

191
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:29,746
You want a cup of coffee
before you go mountain-climbing?

192
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,085
That would be nice.

193
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:41,507
[Narrator] The beautiful fugitive's name was Grace.

194
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:46,846
She hadn't chosen Dogville from a map
or sought out the township for a visit,

195
00:15:46,888 --> 00:15:51,100
yet Tom felt right away that she belonged.

196
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,853
Shall I take the bone?

197
00:15:59,608 --> 00:16:02,861
[Narrator] She could have kept
her vulnerability to herself,

198
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:07,199
but she had elected to give herself up
to him at random.

199
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:12,704
As.. yes.. a gift.

200
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:16,958
"Generous, very generous",
thought Tom.

201
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:23,590
You want to eat?
You must be hungry?

202
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:25,091
I can't.

203
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:28,845
I don't deserve that bread!

204
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,725
I stole that bone.
I haven't stolen anything before.

205
00:16:35,851 --> 00:16:39,605
So now, now I have to punish myself.

206
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:46,945
I was raised to be arrogant,
so I had to teach myself these things.

207
00:16:48,405 --> 00:16:54,077
Well, it may be best for your education...

208
00:16:55,078 --> 00:17:00,417
Grace, in this town in these times...

209
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:05,338
it is very impolite not to eat
what's set before you.

210
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:09,550
I'm so sorry.

211
00:17:20,644 --> 00:17:24,648
Who were the men in the car?
Why would they want to hurt you?

212
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:32,072
The man in the back of the car,
he's the boss. I saw his face.

213
00:17:32,864 --> 00:17:37,786
He gave me his telephone number,
told me to call if I saw you.

214
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:42,624
I'm sure he'd offered you a big reward
if you told him where I was.

215
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:44,000
Yeah.

216
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,131
Where's your family?

217
00:17:50,173 --> 00:17:52,008
I don't have a family.

218
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:54,719
All I had was a father...

219
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,142
but those gangsters took him away from me.

220
00:18:01,976 --> 00:18:04,728
What if I said you could stay here?

221
00:18:04,853 --> 00:18:06,188
Here?

222
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,650
But even if you meant it, it's impossible.

223
00:18:11,777 --> 00:18:17,282
It's very small town, I have to hide.
People will ask questions.

224
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:21,995
Well, it might not matter.
Not if they all wanted to help you too.

225
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,166
Are you saying that everybody
in this town is like you?

226
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:30,920
They're good people.
You know, they're honest people.

227
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:33,464
They've all been in need themselves.

228
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:36,259
They might well turn you down, but...

229
00:18:37,301 --> 00:18:39,929
I think it would be worth the trouble to ask.

230
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:43,182
But I got nothing to offer them in return.

231
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:47,102
No, I think you have plenty to offer Dogville.

232
00:18:55,027 --> 00:18:59,739
[Narrator] To call the mood of the audience
at Tom's morale lecture in the mission house the next day,

233
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:05,036
"enthusiastic" would have been going to far,
but they had come.

234
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:10,792
And Tom had launched himself fearlessly
into his endeavor to illustrate the human problem:

235
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,877
To receive.

236
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:22,887
The subject was obvious, but quite
dreadfully ill-considered by this young man.

237
00:19:23,012 --> 00:19:27,725
To compensate for his lack of preparation
Tom made diligent use of his technique

238
00:19:27,725 --> 00:19:32,020
of lashing out somewhat haphazardly
in all directions.

239
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,650
His father peered around covertly
to gauge the mood,

240
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:41,780
and sensing that the assembly was not
entirely happy with this rather direct criticism,

241
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:44,866
he decided to forestall any protest.

242
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:47,952
Now I'm sure that you wish us well, Tom,

243
00:19:48,244 --> 00:19:53,666
but um.. of any town, I believe this one has
a very fine sense of community.

244
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,544
Living side by side we all know one another.

245
00:19:56,586 --> 00:19:58,546
I'm a pretty fair judge of character myself.

246
00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:01,299
Honestly, Tom, you've done it again.

247
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:03,843
Made us come here to listen
to a lot of nonsense.

248
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:07,096
What do you think you are,
some kind of philosopher?

249
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:08,973
Observant, that's what I am.

250
00:20:09,014 --> 00:20:12,935
Lazy, I would say.
We shovel snow together.

251
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:14,728
We shovel snow together?

252
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:15,562
Yeah.

253
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:18,523
Every household clears their own front walk.

254
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:23,403
Yeah, I gotta allow that Tom's right on that.
If roads don't get 
cleared properly...

255
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:28,950
I'm sorry Tom, you're going to have to
come up with something better than that.

256
00:20:28,992 --> 00:20:34,622
But the whole country would be better served
with a greater attitude of openness and accenpance.

257
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:38,084
You're suggesting that we all
wouldn't help out if someone needed help.

258
00:20:38,126 --> 00:20:39,794
No, that's not the point.
That's not the point.

259
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:41,129
We care for human beings up here.

260
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:44,382
We would probably never find out.

261
00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:53,057
Since nobody seems to want to admit
that there's a problem,

262
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:56,643
let me illustrate.

263
00:20:58,187 --> 00:21:02,107
Now I'm not going to use something
that's already happened.

264
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:07,028
I'm going to use something
that's just about to happen.

265
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:16,746
[Narrator] And, after providing a quick summary
of the events of the previous evening
to the astonished people of Dogville,

266
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:22,835
Tom went down to the mine to retrieve
the fugitive from her hideaway.

267
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:36,765
Allow me to introduce Grace.
Grace, these are the citizens of Dogville.

268
00:21:37,725 --> 00:21:39,309
- Hello.
- Hello.

269
00:21:42,813 --> 00:21:45,482
Tom has told us about your predicament, Miss.

270
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:48,318
I really don't want to put any of you
in jeopardy.

271
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:50,111
Why don't you just go to the police?

272
00:21:50,153 --> 00:21:53,865
They can take care of gangsters!
It's their job.

273
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:58,828
I, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
The transportation 
business would uh...

274
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:59,412
Ben!

275
00:22:00,204 --> 00:22:08,379
These men, they have powerful connections,
even with the police.

276
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:11,424
Do you think we should give
sanctuary to a fugitive?

277
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:16,595
A fugitive that gangsters wanna get a hold of.
That would put us in pretty pickle.

278
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:18,389
Easy, Claire...
think of your asthma.

279
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:21,183
Dogville is a good place to hide,
that's for certain.

280
00:22:21,266 --> 00:22:24,228
Exactly.
The only way up here is Canyon Road.

281
00:22:24,728 --> 00:22:31,401
That could easily be watched by Ma Ginger's
-excuse me-nosey cousin who lives
only yards from the turn off.

282
00:22:31,526 --> 00:22:34,529
She has a telephone.
Martha, you could ring the bell,

283
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:37,032
tell the town if people were coming.

284
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:43,288
But Tom, I chime the hours,
what if people get confused with all the ringing?

285
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:47,667
Come now, Martha.
Surely we can use our old bell to save a life, if need be.

286
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,086
Why should we?

287
00:22:50,544 --> 00:22:53,672
Because we care, Chuck.
We care for other human beings.

288
00:22:53,714 --> 00:22:55,257
No, that ain't what I mean.

289
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,719
How do we know that this woman is
telling us the truth?

290
00:22:58,761 --> 00:23:03,640
Maybe these gangsters did shoot at her,
but that don't make her somebody to be trusted.

291
00:23:03,724 --> 00:23:09,021
He is right.
Why would you trust me?

292
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,189
I trust you!

293
00:23:11,314 --> 00:23:14,192
Tom, we're not gangsters.

294
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:19,572
We mind our own business
we don't ask nothin' from nobody.

295
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:22,367
So at last you admit it!

296
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,705
If only there were some way,
we wouldn't doubt the young lady's word.

297
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:29,207
some way to know her..

298
00:23:29,248 --> 00:23:31,584
Then I think we would all ignore the risk.

299
00:23:32,752 --> 00:23:35,588
But there is a way!
You said it yourself.

300
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:38,507
By living side by side with her.

301
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:41,719
Dad, you are such a fine judge of character.

302
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,222
How long would it take a good man
like you to unmask her?

303
00:23:45,347 --> 00:23:49,059
A week? Maybe two?

304
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:51,728
Surely we can offer her two weeks.

305
00:23:52,896 --> 00:23:56,650
And if after that time so much as
one man cries out 'BE GONE!'

306
00:23:56,691 --> 00:24:00,570
I promise I'll happily send her
packing herself.

307
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:12,707
Well, if Master Tom thinks this is right
for us, and for the 
community,

308
00:24:12,707 --> 00:24:19,338
then that will do for me.
He might be young, but his heart is right.

309
00:24:19,588 --> 00:24:23,092
And I've known his heart
for as long las it's been beating.

310
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,521
[Narrator] No more words were spoken
at the town meeting in the mission house.

311
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:42,694
But it had been decided, they all felt,
that the fugitive would be given two weeks.

312
00:24:42,902 --> 00:24:46,114
And they would all be able to look
at themselves in the mirror and know

313
00:24:46,197 --> 00:24:52,787
that they had done what they could, indeed,
and perhaps more than most people would have done.

314
00:24:54,997 --> 00:25:03,714
So that very afternoon Tom took Grace on a stroll
down Elm Street to introduce her to the town "he loved".

315
00:25:03,797 --> 00:25:08,552
Well, this is where Olivia and June live.

316
00:25:08,552 --> 00:25:14,474
June is a cripple...
They live here as a token of my dad's broadmindedness.

317
00:25:14,683 --> 00:25:18,520
Chuck and Vera have seven children
and they hate each other.

318
00:25:18,895 --> 00:25:27,195
Next door we have the Hensons.
They make a living from grinding edges off
cheap glasses to try to make them look expensive.

319
00:25:27,237 --> 00:25:32,617
And here we have Jack McKay.
Now, Jack McKay is blind and the whole town knows it.

320
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:37,413
But he thinks he can hide it
by never leaving his house.

321
00:25:37,497 --> 00:25:39,915
In the old stable Ben keeps his truck.

322
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:46,797
He drinks and he visits the whorehouse
once a month and he is ashamed of it.

323
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:53,679
Martha she runs the mission house
until the new preacher comes which will just never happen.

324
00:25:54,555 --> 00:26:01,186
That leaves Ma Ginger and Gloria.
They run this really expensive store,

325
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:05,440
where they exploit the fact
that nobody leaves town.

326
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,278
Used to leave to go vote,
but since they put on the registration fee,

327
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:17,243
about a day's wage for these people,
they don't feel the democratic need any more.

328
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:25,209
Those awful figurines say more about
the people in this town, than many words.

329
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:29,755
If this is the town that you love,
then you really have a strange way of showing it.

330
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:40,932
All I see, is a beautiful little town
in the midst of magnificent mountains.

331
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:50,275
A place where people have hopes
and dreams even under the hardest conditions.

332
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:56,698
And seven figurines that are not awful at all.

333
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,453
[Narrator] Calling Dogville beautiful was
original at least.

334
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:10,544
Grace was just casting one more look
at the figurines she herself would have dismissed
as tasteless a few days earlier,

335
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:19,720
when she suddenly sensed
what would best have been described
as a tiny change of light over Dogville.

336
00:27:40,907 --> 00:27:43,993
They are keeping an eye on you.

337
00:27:43,993 --> 00:27:49,123
If you love them already,
they might need a little persuading.

338
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:53,961
You've got two weeks
to get them to accept you.

339
00:27:54,378 --> 00:27:57,256
You make it sound like
we are playing a game.

340
00:27:58,006 --> 00:28:05,931
It is. We are. Isn't saving your life
worth a little game?

341
00:28:06,098 --> 00:28:07,891
What do you want me to do?

342
00:28:08,058 --> 00:28:10,018
Do you mind physical labour?

343
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:12,228
No!

344
00:28:13,313 --> 00:28:16,483
Dogville has offered you two weeks.

345
00:28:17,901 --> 00:28:20,111
now you offer them...

346
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:38,754
[Narrator] The next day was
a beautiful day in Dogville.

347
00:28:38,796 --> 00:28:42,966
The tender leaves on Ma Ginger's
goosberry bushes were unfurling

348
00:28:42,966 --> 00:28:47,804
despite wise Tom's misgivings
as regards her gardening methods.

349
00:28:48,138 --> 00:28:56,813
But more than that, this first day of spring
had also benn picked to be Grace's first ever day of work.

350
00:28:56,896 --> 00:29:04,195
The day in which she was to set off around
Dogville and ofeer herself one hour per household per day.

351
00:29:04,195 --> 00:29:05,446
Excuse me.

352
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:13,662
I would like to offer you my help..
if there is anything that you need?

353
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,710
Yeah.. A carburetor that don't leak..

354
00:29:21,837 --> 00:29:24,840
alright here, let me take that.

355
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,467
Maybe I could help around your home?

356
00:29:28,635 --> 00:29:35,308
I don't really have a home.
Just the garage.

357
00:29:37,686 --> 00:29:40,563
I'm in the freight business.
The road is my home!

358
00:29:40,605 --> 00:29:42,649
I'm ready. Good morning!

359
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,651
Miss Olivia has got a home.

360
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,113
She is looking to help out
in somebody's home.

361
00:29:49,197 --> 00:29:51,657
A cleanin' lady for a cleanin' lady?

362
00:29:52,366 --> 00:29:55,536
You be talkin' nonsense, Mister Ben!

363
00:29:55,745 --> 00:29:56,912
Have a good day!

364
00:29:56,954 --> 00:30:00,291
Alright. See ya later on!

365
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:05,087
[Narrator] And off Ben went to Georgetown
with the weekly shipment of glasses

366
00:30:05,087 --> 00:30:11,843
that Mr. Henson had so laboriously cleansed
with his polisher of any trace of their cheap manufacture.

367
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:22,270
So Grace turned into the alley
which went by the exotic name, Glunen Street

368
00:30:23,646 --> 00:30:28,443
to knock on the door of the blind,
but only too vain, man.

369
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:31,279
Yes?

370
00:30:32,572 --> 00:30:35,950
Good morning, Mr. McKay.
My name is Grace.

371
00:30:36,158 --> 00:30:40,496
I was wondering if there is anything
I can do for you?

372
00:30:41,247 --> 00:30:43,958
Oh, that's very kind of you, Grace,
but...

373
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:48,670
I was thinking that perhaps because of
the situation that you are in...

374
00:30:49,296 --> 00:30:51,715
What situation am I in?

375
00:30:52,966 --> 00:30:59,806
Hmm... You are.. on your own.

376
00:31:01,683 --> 00:31:06,813
Oh, I have been on my own for so long.

377
00:31:07,438 --> 00:31:09,774
Anything that you might need?

378
00:31:11,317 --> 00:31:13,069
I'm sorry!

379
00:31:13,111 --> 00:31:19,325
Have you ever noticed the wooden spire
on the roof of the mission house?

380
00:31:19,325 --> 00:31:26,707
At 5 o'clock in the afternoon, it points
a shadow at Ginger's grocery store,

381
00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:34,214
right at the O in OPEN
on the sign in the window.

382
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,010
Maybe it is telling people that it is time
to go shopping for supper.

383
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,722
Goodbye, Mr. McKay.

384
00:31:44,015 --> 00:31:45,683
Bye, Grace!

385
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:51,814
[Narrator] Grace's interview with Jack McKay
proved sadly 
symptomatic of the attitude in Dogville.

386
00:31:52,982 --> 00:31:57,445
Reserved but friendly,
not without curiosity.

387
00:31:59,071 --> 00:32:03,826
Only Jack had expressed his "no"
consicely and precisely:

388
00:32:04,034 --> 00:32:09,373
Martha needed a monologue almost
an hour long to arrive at the same conclusion.

389
00:32:09,415 --> 00:32:13,043
Oh my goodness... I, I, I'd have to think of
work for you to do,

390
00:32:13,085 --> 00:32:15,545
because I have barely enough work myself.

391
00:32:16,254 --> 00:32:21,051
[Narrator] So not very much later Grace had
ended up next to Ma Ginger's gooseberry bushes

392
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:24,846
in a mood that was not particularly good.

393
00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:29,392
She could not tell a gooseberry bush
from a cactus,

394
00:32:29,476 --> 00:32:33,146
but the meticulous order in the yard
appealed to her,

395
00:32:33,438 --> 00:32:37,733
such as the metal chains placed there
in order to shield the second and third bushes,

396
00:32:37,817 --> 00:32:44,323
lest anybody decided to make use of
the deplorably time-honored shortcut to the old lady's bency.

397
00:32:45,074 --> 00:32:50,079
Grace pulled herself together and
headed towards the store.

398
00:32:53,207 --> 00:32:54,249
Hello!

399
00:32:55,459 --> 00:33:00,922
Hello. We don't need any help here either.
I told that to Tom.

400
00:33:00,922 --> 00:33:05,427
Wow, it doesn't matter anyway,
because there is nothing I can do.

401
00:33:05,594 --> 00:33:08,096
I have never worked a day in my life, so.

402
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:16,938
You know, if you put some aloe on
those hands of yours they'll be better by morning.

403
00:33:17,021 --> 00:33:20,608
It's the wood shavings.
I really do hate them.

404
00:33:22,026 --> 00:33:24,445
But I do believe I'll take your advice.

405
00:33:24,528 --> 00:33:27,948
Your hands are surely the most
alabaster hands I've ever seen.

406
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,285
Here comes Tom, how lucky we are.

407
00:33:32,161 --> 00:33:37,499
Hi, all. Grace.. how is all going?

408
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,960
- Not very well, I'm afraid.
- Really?

409
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,087
No. Nobody needs any help.

410
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,589
Well, I thought that might be the case.

411
00:33:44,714 --> 00:33:49,970
His plan to make everybody like me
has run into a few problems

412
00:33:50,053 --> 00:33:52,388
because nobody wants me to work for them.

413
00:33:52,388 --> 00:33:55,475
I would really like to offer something in return.

414
00:33:56,684 --> 00:33:59,729
You're all running a terrible risk
having me here.

415
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,982
I mean, I am willing to learn.

416
00:34:03,065 --> 00:34:07,695
There must be someone who needs help.
Mr. McKay's sight is not good.

417
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:12,283
Yes, I went to Mr. McKay.
I went to Martha and to Chuck and Vera's,

418
00:34:12,324 --> 00:34:14,910
and nobody seems to need any help.

419
00:34:15,035 --> 00:34:17,996
They all think everyone else needs
something, and not themselves.

420
00:34:18,038 --> 00:34:22,084
Funny, that's exactly what Tom said.
I supposed he's pleased.

421
00:34:23,627 --> 00:34:29,257
Just to prove him wrong,
maybe you can lend a hand here.

422
00:34:30,008 --> 00:34:33,261
But Ginger, there really isn't anything
we need done.

423
00:34:33,303 --> 00:34:35,597
Perhaps there's something
you don't need done?

424
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,849
Anything we don't need done?

425
00:34:37,891 --> 00:34:43,813
Something.. something that you would like
done, but that you don't think is necessay.

426
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,940
What on earth would that be?

427
00:34:45,982 --> 00:34:48,317
Maybe... maybe the gooseberry bushes.

428
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:50,861
The gooseberries are just fine,
thank you very much.

429
00:34:51,028 --> 00:34:55,157
No. Not yours. The ones that planted
themselves in the tall grass.

430
00:34:55,824 --> 00:34:57,326
We don't grow anything there.

431
00:34:57,368 --> 00:35:01,079
Exactly. A bit of tiding up.

432
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:05,459
Who knows, those bushes might
one day bear fruit.

433
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:08,587
Yeah. That's true! Who knows..

434
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,338
All right, girl.

435
00:35:11,506 --> 00:35:18,471
Those alabaster hands of yours are
hereby engaged to weed the wild gooseberry bushes.

436
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:20,890
Thank you!

437
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:25,228
Around.. like this, you see.

438
00:35:26,104 --> 00:35:29,398
Anything to close them...
just be careful, that's all.

439
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:35,279
[Narrator] After a few of the wild little
gooseberry bushes had given up the ghost

440
00:35:35,279 --> 00:35:39,825
in the care of Grace's as yet
unpracticed alabaster hands,

441
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:44,663
things began looking up
with the weeding and the town.

442
00:35:46,665 --> 00:35:54,381
In fact it turned out there were not so few things
that the other townsfold of Dogville didn't need doing either.

443
00:35:55,298 --> 00:36:01,846
As Ben had no home, Grace's domestic
experiments were absolutely things he didn't need,

444
00:36:02,472 --> 00:36:09,187
but he put up with them anyhow,
appearing with astonishing punctuality
when the act of domesticity had been completed,

445
00:36:09,228 --> 00:36:14,442
no matter how unpredictable business
hours in the freight industry might otherwise have been.

446
00:36:18,112 --> 00:36:22,950
Olivia didn't need anyone to help June
to the toilet while she was at work,

447
00:36:22,991 --> 00:36:28,997
as hitherto they had coped splendidly
with Olivia's excellent diaper arrangement.

448
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:37,922
If Jack McKay had needed a partner
for conversation he would surely have gone out
and gotten one for himself in the town.

449
00:36:38,214 --> 00:36:43,261
So it was not out of need that he allowed
Grace to sit with him in his dark parlor

450
00:36:43,303 --> 00:36:51,853
with the dramatic drapes on one wall
for lengthy discussions regarding
the underestimated qualities of the light on the East Coast.

451
00:36:53,604 --> 00:36:59,443
As Martha wouldn't dream of burdening
the parish with wear and tear of the pedals and bellows,

452
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:05,491
while waiting for the new priest to be appointed,
she practiced without a note ever leaving the organ,

453
00:37:05,532 --> 00:37:10,037
and was therefore not really
in need of anyone to turn her pages.

454
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:17,252
And God knows that Mr. and Mrs. Henson's son
did not need any help with his books,

455
00:37:17,794 --> 00:37:21,965
and that the family had taken Grace
for her own sake.

456
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:31,265
And although Liz's hands had improved
through Grace's good counsel,

457
00:37:31,391 --> 00:37:36,896
Thomas Edison was a doctor and
of indisputable health and he did not need care,

458
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:41,192
or help with the pills from the medicine
closet with its many secrets.

459
00:37:45,446 --> 00:37:49,992
Actually Chuck was the only one
"not yet hooked", as Tom put it.

460
00:37:50,075 --> 00:37:56,373
Hooked? You sound so arrogant!
Arrogance is the worst thing!

461
00:37:56,665 --> 00:37:58,500
He doesn't like me.

462
00:38:00,252 --> 00:38:02,295
And he has every right to feel that way.

463
00:38:02,337 --> 00:38:08,468
Yeah. Listen!
Luckily I have prepared a Trojan horse.

464
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:09,969
A what?

465
00:38:10,136 --> 00:38:12,847
Trojan horse.
We can get in by way of Vera.

466
00:38:12,972 --> 00:38:21,689
There is this.. lecture tomorrow
in Georgetown, given by some professor.

467
00:38:21,814 --> 00:38:25,985
Some intellectual thing.

468
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:31,031
But not so intellectual he can't tour
the provinces with it, anyway, the point is,

469
00:38:31,365 --> 00:38:36,745
Vera she would do anything to go,
but she's got no one to mind Achilles while she is gone.

470
00:38:36,953 --> 00:38:42,709
She trusts the girls mastering their iambs
and pentameters, but not with the little one.

471
00:38:42,709 --> 00:38:48,089
So this is where you come in.
I said that you could watch him tomorrow afternoon.

472
00:38:48,214 --> 00:38:55,138
Now, I will try and stall her on her way home
and with a bit of luck, Chuck'll get back before she does

473
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:59,892
and you can use the time and
all your charm to try and win him over.

474
00:38:59,934 --> 00:39:03,521
I'll happily mind Achilles if Vera will let me.

475
00:39:03,604 --> 00:39:07,024
But if he doesn't like me he doesn't like me.

476
00:39:08,025 --> 00:39:13,155
[Narrator] Tom really was enchanted by this
unusual, mysterious creature.

477
00:39:13,447 --> 00:39:18,910
And even though she did not satisfy
his curiosity by saying 
anything about her past

478
00:39:18,952 --> 00:39:28,503
so as not to put anyone in danger,
she still fitted Tom's mission to educate Dogville
on the subject of acceptance like a glove.

479
00:39:29,129 --> 00:39:31,214
Tom felt content.

480
00:39:31,214 --> 00:39:36,928
Grace had been dangling over the edge,
and he had been the one to pull her back onto the path.

481
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:43,225
It gave him a fine sensation of mastery,
new for him in terms of the opposite sex,

482
00:39:43,392 --> 00:39:48,147
and his feelings unleashed the best
in his burgeoning love.

483
00:39:59,157 --> 00:40:10,502
Hello. This is Dahlia, Olympia, Diana,
Athena, Pandora, Jason, Achilles.

484
00:40:15,048 --> 00:40:16,591
Your children are lovely.

485
00:40:16,716 --> 00:40:23,806
They are good kids. And I love them.

486
00:40:29,228 --> 00:40:34,358
Please don't say any such nice things
about the kids. I cry too easily.

487
00:40:36,276 --> 00:40:39,029
Both in sorrow and in joy.

488
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,949
- Hey, Vera.
- Oh, hi!

489
00:40:42,324 --> 00:40:44,451
- Shall we go?
- I'm ready.

490
00:40:44,826 --> 00:40:47,120
Thanks for leaving the map out.

491
00:40:47,204 --> 00:40:51,333
I'd a plum forgot it, I'm sure.
How did you know I was going that far?

492
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:56,337
The last time I saw the thermos,
it was on the doorstep and the map was beside it,

493
00:40:56,337 --> 00:41:01,676
so I just thought, when I saw the thermos
this time and no map, but...

494
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:06,305
You are a sweet girl, Grace.

495
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,724
Sweet as Miss Laura.

496
00:41:09,058 --> 00:41:10,351
Who's Miss Laura?

497
00:41:10,393 --> 00:41:12,853
You gave yourself again, Ben.

498
00:41:12,895 --> 00:41:17,566
I think Miss Laura is
what Ovid might call a Maenad.

499
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:24,573
Oh, don't be ashamed, Ben.

500
00:41:25,032 --> 00:41:28,326
We all have the right to make the most of our lives.

501
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:34,040
I'm sure that those ladies in those houses
they bring a lot of joy to a lot of men.

502
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:41,130
Ain't nothing I'm proud of.
It really ain't.

503
00:41:58,981 --> 00:42:01,108
I know what you are doing here.

504
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,111
You do?

505
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:09,908
You want people to like you,
so you don't have to go away.

506
00:42:11,535 --> 00:42:13,286
You are very smart.

507
00:42:15,705 --> 00:42:18,458
Yes, I like it here in Dogville.

508
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:24,130
Do you want me to read to you?
About the Cyclops?

509
00:42:24,714 --> 00:42:27,425
I don't like the Cyclops.

510
00:42:28,426 --> 00:42:34,515
Two eyes are pretties, like yours.

511
00:42:39,311 --> 00:42:45,275
If you want my Ma to like you, and let you stay.
You'll just have to be nice to me.

512
00:42:48,153 --> 00:42:50,530
Maybe you should help me clean up instead.

513
00:42:50,906 --> 00:42:55,827
Ma says I don't have to work,
'cept in my head.

514
00:42:55,994 --> 00:42:59,998
Oh, but what about if I ask you, please?

515
00:43:00,206 --> 00:43:01,166
Ok.

516
00:43:15,513 --> 00:43:16,847
What are you doing here?

517
00:43:16,972 --> 00:43:19,475
Didn't I tell you we don't need
no help from you?

518
00:43:19,517 --> 00:43:21,477
Ma asked her to mind me and Achilles.

519
00:43:21,477 --> 00:43:24,688
Quiet! Get out! The lot of you.

520
00:43:27,524 --> 00:43:29,276
The same nonsense!

521
00:43:29,943 --> 00:43:32,863
They'd have done just great in Antiquity,
no doubt.

522
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:37,659
How is it going otherwise,
with the fooling act?

523
00:43:41,454 --> 00:43:43,373
I wasn't trying to fool anyone?

524
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:48,211
I mean Dogville.
Has it got you fooled yet?

525
00:43:51,464 --> 00:43:55,426
I thought you were implying
that I was trying to exploit the town.

526
00:43:55,968 --> 00:43:58,012
Wishful thinking.

527
00:44:00,014 --> 00:44:03,934
This town is rotten from the inside out,

528
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:07,354
and I wouldn't miss it,
if it fell into the gorge tomorrow.

529
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:15,404
I see no charm here, but you seem to.

530
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:19,032
Admit it you've fallen for Dogville.

531
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,329
The trees, the mountains,
the simple folk.

532
00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:28,249
And if all that ain't got you fooled yet,
I bet the cinnamon has.

533
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:32,336
That damned cinnamon
in those gooseberry pies.

534
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:36,841
Dogville has everything that you ever
dreamed of in the big city.

535
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:42,221
You are worse than Tom.
How do you know what I dreamed of?

536
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,686
You're from the city yourself, aren't you?

537
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,647
That was a long time ago.

538
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:55,525
I am not that stupid anymore,
I found out that people are the same all over.

539
00:44:55,525 --> 00:44:57,110
Greedy as animals.

540
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,822
In a small town they're just a bit
less successful.

541
00:45:00,822 --> 00:45:03,700
Feed 'em enough they'll eat
till their bellies burst.

542
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,952
That's why you wanted to get rid of me...

543
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:11,457
because you can't stand that I remind
you of what it was you came here to find.

544
00:45:19,507 --> 00:45:21,634
I'm telling you for the last time
to get out of my home.

545
00:45:21,759 --> 00:45:23,928
Moses don't like you.
And I don't like you.

546
00:45:24,428 --> 00:45:27,056
The kids are going crazy enough
from their ma's teachin'.

547
00:45:27,097 --> 00:45:28,766
Thank you, Grace!

548
00:45:47,117 --> 00:45:52,163
[Narrator] The two seeks had passed far too quickly.
Grace had enjoyed herself.

549
00:45:52,747 --> 00:45:56,209
All she could say was that
she was fond of them all,

550
00:45:56,292 --> 00:46:00,880
including the folk who had greeted her
with reluctance and hostility.

551
00:46:01,297 --> 00:46:07,344
Even though she might not have won everybody
over completely or even half way, as Tom put it,

552
00:46:08,095 --> 00:46:14,268
She cared for Dogville and she had shown
the town her face, her true face.

553
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,728
But was that enough?

554
00:46:17,271 --> 00:46:23,610
During Jack McKay's long lecture that evening
she had found herself in a heart-searching mood.

555
00:46:24,027 --> 00:46:28,114
Whether heart-searching or
concern for her future was the cause,

556
00:46:28,198 --> 00:46:36,706
the result was that the otherwise so lovable
Grace indulged in a pretty shady piece of provocation.

557
00:46:36,706 --> 00:46:45,756
So you agree that the windows of St. Bridget's,
at the first time you saw them,
didn't live up to their reputation.

558
00:46:46,465 --> 00:46:52,221
I don't think it is the position of the church itself.

559
00:46:52,346 --> 00:47:03,190
Maybe it's the light in Los Angeles and
the mosaic glass in those windows they kind of collide,

560
00:47:05,192 --> 00:47:07,444
I remember thinking that.

561
00:47:09,237 --> 00:47:13,908
I think we've talked long enough about
the way we remembering seeing things.

562
00:47:14,117 --> 00:47:15,326
Don't you?

563
00:47:16,953 --> 00:47:22,959
Why don't we talk about something
that we can see right now?

564
00:47:23,668 --> 00:47:29,256
There is not much to see around here.
Wretched town.

565
00:47:30,591 --> 00:47:32,718
Why don't we talk about the view?

566
00:47:37,097 --> 00:47:45,522
I don't go out much.
The sun and my skin.

567
00:47:45,522 --> 00:47:48,817
Yesterday I was walking in Chuck's apple trees.

568
00:47:50,777 --> 00:47:57,659
If you go right up to the edge of the cliff
you just manage to peer round Ben's garage

569
00:47:57,659 --> 00:48:01,329
and you get a view of your house
from the side facing the gorge.

570
00:48:02,038 --> 00:48:07,793
I didn't realize that there was windows behind there.

571
00:48:08,628 --> 00:48:15,217
Huge windows.
There must be a wonderful view.

572
00:48:16,802 --> 00:48:19,221
Would you mind if I opened them?

573
00:49:00,761 --> 00:49:07,142
You're no fool, Miss Grace.
You're no fool.

574
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:12,856
You probably see that those curtains
are hard to open.

575
00:49:12,939 --> 00:49:14,024
Sorry!

576
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:23,491
And obviously concluded that it's because
they're not used very often.

577
00:49:25,743 --> 00:49:32,291
But the view's good, entrancing even.

578
00:49:36,128 --> 00:49:47,931
So, ask me, why a man who loves the light
hang these heavy curtains?

579
00:49:55,147 --> 00:49:59,567
Yes, I'm blind.

580
00:50:00,026 --> 00:50:07,158
Not weak sighted, not myopic: blind.

581
00:50:09,452 --> 00:50:20,880
So please go
and let me be that on my own.

582
00:50:27,553 --> 00:50:36,770
Is Switzerland they call it the Alpengulen.

583
00:50:38,188 --> 00:50:43,151
That's the light that reflects
from the highest peaks

584
00:50:43,568 --> 00:50:48,656
after the sun goes down behind the mountains.

585
00:50:50,908 --> 00:50:52,743
But now it's gone.

586
00:51:17,017 --> 00:51:22,188
[Narrator] It was in complete silence
that the people of Dogville turned up for the meeting
at the mission house

587
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:26,359
two weeks to the day since the beautiful
fugitive had come to town.

588
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:32,782
Grace was standing beside Tom,
watching them convene,

589
00:51:32,865 --> 00:51:40,081
and knew inside herself that this might well be
the last time she would see these now so familiar faces.

590
00:51:40,164 --> 00:51:45,794
She had at least two of them against her,
and even one would have been too many.

591
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:49,840
Welcome good people of Dogville.

592
00:51:49,882 --> 00:51:57,514
Two weeks.... two weeks have passed
and it is time for your verdict.

593
00:51:57,889 --> 00:52:01,852
Is it right that she should be here while we talk?

594
00:52:01,893 --> 00:52:06,189
Well, Mrs. Henson, when Grace first came
she made no attempt to hide her weakness from us.

595
00:52:06,231 --> 00:52:14,405
So I think it is only right we be as open
with her, tell her to her face if we want her to leave.

596
00:52:14,947 --> 00:52:17,074
No, Mrs. Henson is right.

597
00:52:17,492 --> 00:52:22,621
Nobody should be prevented from
speaking their mind out of politeness.

598
00:52:23,706 --> 00:52:25,583
I'll wait at the mine.

599
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:33,173
And if the vote says that I should leave,
then I'll take the path across the mountains, while it's still light.

600
00:52:34,216 --> 00:52:38,136
And the things I've borrowed, if you could,
return them to everybody.

601
00:52:38,262 --> 00:52:39,262
Of course!

602
00:52:39,262 --> 00:52:41,807
Nobody has to see me before I go.

603
00:52:42,265 --> 00:52:45,810
Martha, if you will just ring the bell
then I'll understand.

604
00:52:46,144 --> 00:52:49,147
I don't ... how do...
am I gonna ring the bell?

605
00:52:49,647 --> 00:52:53,484
Just ring it for every vote that lets me stay.

606
00:52:53,818 --> 00:53:00,575
I will count. And if it doesn't reach
fifteen, then I'll leave.

607
00:53:09,416 --> 00:53:15,255
Tom is anxious to speak in her behalf,
but I think he's had his allotted time.

608
00:53:15,339 --> 00:53:20,761
We know his view. We respect it.
And now he must respect ours.

609
00:53:21,803 --> 00:53:26,600
[Narrator] Grace pulled her bundle out from
under the bureau to change into her own clothes,

610
00:53:26,641 --> 00:53:31,354
only to discover that somebody had been
in it and left a loaf of bread.

611
00:53:33,356 --> 00:53:36,150
Next to it was a folded sheet of paper.

612
00:53:36,276 --> 00:53:39,112
It was a map Tom had drawn.

613
00:53:39,112 --> 00:53:42,782
He had known where the bundle was
and had put it there.

614
00:53:42,824 --> 00:53:45,201
It showed the path across the mountain.

615
00:53:45,243 --> 00:53:50,623
And all the dangerous spots were
furnished with witty horrific little sketches.

616
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:54,126
But there was more.

617
00:53:54,209 --> 00:54:00,716
Several people had the same idea.
They had eased gifts into the bundle for her.

618
00:54:00,757 --> 00:54:05,637
Jason's beloved little penknife lay there,
all polished and shiny.

619
00:54:05,721 --> 00:54:11,851
And a pie from Ma Ginger and Gloria.
And some clothing and matches, and a hymnal.

620
00:54:12,227 --> 00:54:17,649
Grace opened it at number 18, where Martha
always had trouble with fingering.

621
00:54:19,067 --> 00:54:25,781
And between the pages lay a dollar bill
Martha alone could not have afforded it.

622
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:31,162
Grace had friends in Dogville.
That was for sure.

623
00:54:31,203 --> 00:54:34,999
Whether they were few or many did not matter a jot.

624
00:54:35,207 --> 00:54:40,546
Grace had bared her throat to the town
and it had responded with a great gift:

625
00:54:40,963 --> 00:54:42,923
with friends.

626
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:54,225
No gangster could deprive her of this
meeting with the township,
no matter how many guns in the world.

627
00:54:54,726 --> 00:55:00,607
And should the strokes of the bell did not reach 15,
she knew now that she meant something to the town

628
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:03,860
and that her stay had been of significance.

629
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:09,240
Not much, perhaps, but nevertheless,
a trace she had left.

630
00:55:10,157 --> 00:55:14,078
And the first in her young life
in which she took pride.

631
00:55:28,175 --> 00:55:31,803
Grace stiffened as the bell began its toll.

632
00:56:16,137 --> 00:56:19,516
Fourteen. Grace counted.

633
00:56:19,933 --> 00:56:27,899
So McKay must have voted for her after all,
and if so, why not Chuck, too?

634
00:57:09,939 --> 00:57:11,399
Everyone?

635
00:57:13,025 --> 00:57:14,610
- Chuck!
- Chuck!

636
00:57:14,944 --> 00:57:16,487
Everyone.

637
00:57:17,822 --> 00:57:20,491
I think they like you here.

638
00:57:39,176 --> 00:57:44,055
[Narrator] The period of spring and early summer
proved a happy one for Grace.

639
00:57:44,597 --> 00:57:47,851
Martha rang the hours,
conducting her through the day.

640
00:57:47,892 --> 00:57:52,855
So she could serve as eyes for McKay,
a mother for Ben,

641
00:57:53,856 --> 00:57:59,028
friend for Vera,
and brains for Bill...

642
00:58:08,579 --> 00:58:15,127
And one day it had occurred to Grace
to tread the pedals herself so to get Martha to agree

643
00:58:15,127 --> 00:58:18,505
to play a couple of paper notes,
just to empty the bellows naturally

644
00:58:18,547 --> 00:58:22,676
so that they wouldn't be left under pressure
and thus be spoiled.

645
00:58:23,426 --> 00:58:28,973
And now they had tacitly agreed that
as long as it was Grace who trode the pedals,

646
00:58:29,015 --> 00:58:32,185
Martha could play without feeling any guilt.

647
00:58:36,481 --> 00:58:41,819
To Tom's pop, the old doctor, who imagined
he had a new ailment every single day

648
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:47,116
and was thus increasingly addicted to
the simpler coordination tests
from his medical school days,

649
00:58:47,116 --> 00:58:51,954
she had to be severe, telling him that
there was nothing wrong with him.

650
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:59,628
And now, since the town had agreed that
everyone was to give according to his abilities

651
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:05,800
she received wages, not much, but enough
to save up for the first of the tiny china figurines

652
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:11,222
from the row of seven that had stood
for so long gathering dust in the window of the store.

653
00:59:12,432 --> 00:59:17,311
And she dreamed that in time she would
be able to acquire them all.

654
00:59:20,273 --> 00:59:28,239
Slowly those alabaster hands turned
into a pair of hands that could have belonged to
anyone in any little rural community.

655
00:59:29,448 --> 00:59:35,996
And three weeks later she triumphantly
moved into a place Tom and Ben had secretly restored,

656
00:59:36,038 --> 00:59:41,084
namely the old mill, which had once held
the town's ore crusher,

657
00:59:41,126 --> 00:59:45,380
but of which only the heavy
flywheel now remained.

658
00:59:52,595 --> 00:59:53,388
Thanks.

659
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,474
That's what I am talking about
with the freight industry.

660
00:59:57,266 --> 01:00:00,603
Miss Laura had thrown that out,
it was no use to anybody.

661
01:00:01,896 --> 01:00:06,275
A good thing, in the wrong place.
But with my truck... You know.

662
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,986
You shouldn't poke fun at
the freight industry, that's all.

663
01:00:10,362 --> 01:00:13,365
No, you're right, Ben.
They shouldn't.

664
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:20,872
Grace!

665
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:23,792
What?

666
01:00:24,584 --> 01:00:29,381
I just had to tell you that I had a really
selfish reason for voting to keep you in Dogville.

667
01:00:33,927 --> 01:00:35,094
What was it?

668
01:00:36,971 --> 01:00:42,351
It was such a relief when you turned up
and you were the one all the men had eyes for.

669
01:00:42,894 --> 01:00:48,524
You know, Tom and them.
I've had to put up with it for so long..

670
01:00:49,442 --> 01:00:52,736
Frankly, I just didn't have
the energy for it anymore.

671
01:00:53,112 --> 01:00:55,489
They'll always have eyes for you, Liz.

672
01:00:56,991 --> 01:01:03,413
You know that.. They will.
You are beautiful.

673
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:04,373
Thank you.

674
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:10,212
[Narrator] The very latest development,
now that summer was at its peak,

675
01:01:10,337 --> 01:01:14,049
was that Grace had been given leave
to help Chuck in the orchard.

676
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:21,723
And every day at 5, once their work was done,
she could appreciate that actually McKay was right;

677
01:01:21,764 --> 01:01:27,395
the shadow of the spire did indeed
point at Ma Ginger's store.

678
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:36,320
But today the tower did not only announce
that it was time to go shopping but also,

679
01:01:36,362 --> 01:01:43,035
by a signal which nobody despite Martha's
initial concern could have confused with the ringing of the hours,

680
01:01:43,243 --> 01:01:48,498
a warning that somebody was approaching
via Canyon Road from Georgetown.

681
01:01:48,665 --> 01:01:54,462
For the first time in living memory
law enforcers had come to Dogville!

682
01:02:03,554 --> 01:02:04,889
Evenin' sir.

683
01:02:07,308 --> 01:02:09,560
Is this the whole place?

684
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:13,314
- There's a town hall?
- No.

685
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:15,441
I got me a notice to paste up.

686
01:02:15,566 --> 01:02:18,527
We got the mission house.
That do you?

687
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:20,154
Sure.

688
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:22,406
What'd she do?

689
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:28,120
Missing! That's all it says.
I guess somebody's been missing her.

690
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:30,872
Heard tell she was last seen around here.

691
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:34,042
We've putting these things
all over the county.

692
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,212
And if somebody sees her,
they ought to go to the police?

693
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,881
I guess that's the idea.

694
01:03:11,912 --> 01:03:14,456
These men were never gonna give in easily.

695
01:03:15,415 --> 01:03:19,878
Now these posters they hang
all over in the county.

696
01:03:21,504 --> 01:03:24,382
which means nobody suspects
she's right here with us.

697
01:03:24,424 --> 01:03:28,344
But it was a policeman, Tom.
Isn't it a duty to respond to the police?

698
01:03:28,344 --> 01:03:36,686
I mean, legally speaking.
I'm sorry, I just.. when I get upset.

699
01:03:37,311 --> 01:03:41,106
She's just a missing person.
She hasn't done anything. He even said so.

700
01:03:41,148 --> 01:03:42,775
I think you should vote again.

701
01:03:42,775 --> 01:03:48,363
Why? We can't resort to plebiscites
time and time again.

702
01:03:49,615 --> 01:03:56,246
Come on. Who's really got cold feet
because of her picture on a piece of paper?

703
01:04:19,226 --> 01:04:28,610
[Narrator] The 4th of July came with the huge
clouds of seeds from some remote meadow
gracefully floating down Elm Street in the early evening.

704
01:04:28,819 --> 01:04:34,574
Today was a day for celebration.
Nobody was to worry about the hard times.

705
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:38,286
And Grace could stop at Ma Ginger's
window quite content:

706
01:04:38,662 --> 01:04:44,334
to ascertain that only two of the little china
figurines remained, and were thus the only two

707
01:04:44,334 --> 01:04:48,004
she had not yet been able to
save up enough to purchase.

708
01:04:52,425 --> 01:04:54,302
- It looks great, girls..
- Uh-huh..

709
01:04:56,512 --> 01:05:01,058
Grace, could you put in a couple of hours
with me in the orchard again today?

710
01:05:01,434 --> 01:05:04,186
It's really nice down there with the sunshine!

711
01:05:04,353 --> 01:05:09,942
Chuck, it's the fourth of July!
What are you talking about sunshine for?

712
01:05:11,151 --> 01:05:14,112
Have you turned into a romantic like me?

713
01:05:18,158 --> 01:05:19,701
We're gonna have fun.

714
01:05:20,952 --> 01:05:22,996
And in the winter we'll all starve...

715
01:05:23,705 --> 01:05:26,583
Even Ben's taking the day off.

716
01:05:28,251 --> 01:05:30,211
- Hi!
- Hi, Tom!

717
01:05:30,462 --> 01:05:32,338
Grace, you've got a moment?

718
01:05:34,674 --> 01:05:35,675
Now?

719
01:05:36,843 --> 01:05:40,388
Yeah. I've got something
interesting to tell you.

720
01:05:42,265 --> 01:05:44,266
Well, it has to be quick.

721
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:54,234
I've got so much going on in my head...

722
01:05:55,652 --> 01:05:58,322
That must be very tiring for you!

723
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:02,826
I think I've done a pretty good analysis
of the folks in this town

724
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:12,168
and I think I understand them
in a meaningful way.

725
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:20,093
But when I come to decipher you,
I get absolutely nowhere.

726
01:06:20,384 --> 01:06:25,056
You know Liz...
Liz is easy to read.

727
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:30,853
And there was some attraction between us,

728
01:06:33,772 --> 01:06:36,275
but as I can see right through her,

729
01:06:37,067 --> 01:06:40,320
intellectually I mean, I can see right through her,

730
01:06:40,571 --> 01:06:48,203
my desire is purely of a physical nature.

731
01:06:50,747 --> 01:06:58,588
But with you, it's more...
it's more complicated.

732
01:06:58,588 --> 01:07:00,506
What are you trying to say?

733
01:07:03,843 --> 01:07:06,470
No, I should get it clear in my head first.

734
01:07:08,973 --> 01:07:11,559
Are you trying to say that ...

735
01:07:13,686 --> 01:07:15,938
you're in love with me?

736
01:07:17,815 --> 01:07:29,326
No, I wouldn't.. love is...
It's not... It's a big word...

737
01:07:29,367 --> 01:07:30,076
Yeah.

738
01:07:34,622 --> 01:07:35,874
Yeah.

739
01:07:38,001 --> 01:07:39,335
That's good!

740
01:07:43,297 --> 01:07:44,590
because ...

741
01:07:48,636 --> 01:07:51,972
I think that I am in love with you, too.

742
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:55,643
Very interesting, isn't it?

743
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:01,607
I mean it's interesting in a psychological...

744
01:08:07,946 --> 01:08:12,325
Did they call you?
I think they are calling you.

745
01:08:15,453 --> 01:08:17,330
I didn't hear them.

746
01:08:20,792 --> 01:08:21,960
No.

747
01:08:25,129 --> 01:08:29,258
You should probably get back anyway.

748
01:08:32,178 --> 01:08:35,598
I will see you at the wedding.
Next celebration..

749
01:09:10,631 --> 01:09:14,593
This year I didn't bring any notes with me.

750
01:09:14,969 --> 01:09:18,055
Because I'm not gonna pretend
I can read them.

751
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:23,769
Which brings me to a point.
A point I wanna make.

752
01:09:24,728 --> 01:09:28,607
And that point is you, Grace.

753
01:09:29,566 --> 01:09:36,281
Yes. You have made Dogville
a wonderful place to live in.

754
01:09:37,032 --> 01:09:43,538
As a matter of fact, somebody tells me
they ran into grumpy old Chuck down the street

755
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:45,999
and he was actually smiling.

756
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:54,799
Well, I've never seen your smile, Grace,
but I will bet you I could describe it.

757
01:09:56,801 --> 01:10:05,100
Because it obviously has every color
that's reflected from the shiniest prism in the world.

758
01:10:05,934 --> 01:10:09,938
You probably have a face to match that.
Does she have a face to match that, Tom?

759
01:10:10,022 --> 01:10:12,190
- Yes, sir.
- Hmm..?
- Yes, sir.

760
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:16,862
I bet she does.
We are proud to have you among us.

761
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:24,327
And we thank you for
showing us who you are.

762
01:10:24,953 --> 01:10:26,871
Here to you, Grace.

763
01:10:27,705 --> 01:10:30,333
Stay with us as long as you damn please.

764
01:10:54,064 --> 01:10:58,485
A police car has just been seen in town and
it has just made the turn up Canyon Road!

765
01:10:59,152 --> 01:11:00,320
So he will be here any minute.

766
01:11:00,654 --> 01:11:02,072
Shall I ring the bell?

767
01:11:03,031 --> 01:11:05,950
No, Martha.
Grace probably heard.

768
01:11:07,285 --> 01:11:08,828
We'll get rid of 'em quickly.

769
01:11:10,038 --> 01:11:11,122
Don't worry.

770
01:11:24,802 --> 01:11:28,138
Should have been celebrating myself,
if this hadn't come up.

771
01:11:28,889 --> 01:11:31,517
Have to change this missing person notice.

772
01:11:32,851 --> 01:11:34,645
It's that lady again.

773
01:11:36,188 --> 01:11:37,939
That's why she disappeared.

774
01:11:40,025 --> 01:11:44,070
She's wanted in connection with some
bank robberies on the West Coast.

775
01:11:44,779 --> 01:11:47,157
When did these robberies take place?

776
01:11:47,615 --> 01:11:49,200
Last couple of weeks.

777
01:11:50,577 --> 01:11:52,829
You don't get much news up here,
do you?

778
01:11:52,954 --> 01:11:55,498
My dad's radio only plays music.

779
01:11:57,708 --> 01:12:00,586
Well, all know is that they say she's dangerous,

780
01:12:00,795 --> 01:12:05,216
and that anyone with any information
about her had better call us pronto.

781
01:12:05,633 --> 01:12:07,092
That's the law.

782
01:12:22,607 --> 01:12:27,529
Two weeks!
Can't be our girl, Tom.

783
01:12:27,988 --> 01:12:29,989
No, she's been here all the time.

784
01:12:29,989 --> 01:12:30,865
Right!

785
01:12:30,949 --> 01:12:33,326
She couldn't have done
what they are accusing her of.

786
01:12:34,535 --> 01:12:36,287
No, that's true, Tom, 
you are right.

787
01:12:36,537 --> 01:12:39,540
Still it's an unpleasant business
just the same.

788
01:12:47,006 --> 01:12:50,217
[Narrator] Grace was the same
and so was the town.

789
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:58,600
That the gangsters had fixed to have
charges made against Grace in their effort
to neuralize her came as no surprise.

790
01:12:59,851 --> 01:13:03,188
But everything had changed a little
yet again.

791
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:10,070
I'm telling you, you have exactly the same
kind of little lump in exactly the same spot
on the other side of your back.

792
01:13:10,111 --> 01:13:10,904
Really!

793
01:13:10,904 --> 01:13:21,497
I can only assume that it belongs
on your body, but you're the doctor, so...

794
01:13:21,873 --> 01:13:28,212
Well, it's very unlikely, don't you think?
that a cancer would develop in such precise symmetry.

795
01:13:28,212 --> 01:13:34,051
- Mr. Edison, please. We've been
over this so many times.
- Anything is possible.

796
01:13:34,093 --> 01:13:41,683
I think you have to accept the fact
that you are an exceptionally healthy elderly gentleman.

797
01:13:42,225 --> 01:13:44,644
I'm gonna rest just the same.

798
01:13:44,728 --> 01:13:46,188
I'll see you in the morning.

799
01:13:46,646 --> 01:13:47,981
I hope so.

800
01:13:48,565 --> 01:13:50,900
What? What did they say?

801
01:13:51,109 --> 01:13:58,199
Well, they couldn't really argue
that anything had changed.

802
01:13:58,491 --> 01:14:03,413
But by not telling the police they felt
they were committing a crime themselves.

803
01:14:07,124 --> 01:14:09,001
- I think I should leave.
- No..

804
01:14:09,085 --> 01:14:10,419
Enough is enough.

805
01:14:10,461 --> 01:14:12,296
I suggested the opposite.

806
01:14:13,339 --> 01:14:14,465
You did?

807
01:14:14,965 --> 01:14:18,469
From a business perspective, ...

808
01:14:19,887 --> 01:14:26,309
from a business perspective,
your presence in Dogville has become more costly.

809
01:14:27,019 --> 01:14:30,480
Because it's more dangerous
for them to have you here,

810
01:14:30,647 --> 01:14:32,857
not that they don't want you,

811
01:14:33,566 --> 01:14:39,072
since they feel there should be
some counterbalance,

812
01:14:39,948 --> 01:14:41,991
some quid pro quo.

813
01:14:42,033 --> 01:14:44,911
That sound like words
that the gangsters would use...

814
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:49,957
There is also more of an incentive
if you don't wanna stay.

815
01:14:52,001 --> 01:14:58,924
See, with all those wanted posters
hanging around the place, I can hardly
think of anywhere else you could hide.

816
01:15:01,009 --> 01:15:04,012
So what's the counterbalance
that you suggested?

817
01:15:07,766 --> 01:15:14,064
They wanted you to work longer hours,
but instead what I proposed is

818
01:15:14,064 --> 01:15:19,819
that you just pay a visit to folks
twice a day now.

819
01:15:19,944 --> 01:15:26,451
That way it would seem that you're willing
to contribute more, without actually
lengthening your day too much.

820
01:15:26,576 --> 01:15:29,537
It's just a way of heading off
any unpleasantness.

821
01:15:34,959 --> 01:15:41,965
Well, it sounds a little peculiar
and difficult to put into practice.

822
01:15:41,965 --> 01:15:43,967
That's what I thought.

823
01:15:44,384 --> 01:15:47,888
Martha she said she would ring
her bell every half hour,

824
01:15:47,971 --> 01:15:51,099
so you could keep track of
your new schedule.

825
01:15:53,977 --> 01:15:55,770
Then, they are all willing to let me stay?

826
01:15:55,812 --> 01:16:03,611
No. See, Mrs. Henson she also
thought we should cut your pay.

827
01:16:04,112 --> 01:16:12,787
Merely a symbolic gesture. You see...
the word dangerous on that poster worried her.

828
01:16:14,789 --> 01:16:21,587
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
If I have to work harder, longer hours for less pay,

829
01:16:21,629 --> 01:16:24,757
then I'm willing to do that.
Of course, I am.

830
01:16:26,508 --> 01:16:31,680
I just wanna be sure that they
wouldn't prefer that I left town.

831
01:16:31,722 --> 01:16:33,223
Of course not.

832
01:16:35,809 --> 01:16:38,103
You think this is for the best?

833
01:16:38,979 --> 01:16:40,855
I know it is.

834
01:16:44,317 --> 01:16:52,575
I have to get some sleep. My days are
gonna be much busier now.

835
01:16:52,617 --> 01:16:53,951
Sorry.

836
01:17:18,517 --> 01:17:25,065
Tom, I just need to know something...

837
01:17:27,692 --> 01:17:31,321
you know the card that the man
in the car gave you...

838
01:17:31,529 --> 01:17:32,447
Yeah.

839
01:17:38,369 --> 01:17:40,621
Did you show it to anyone?

840
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:46,043
Come on, Grace!
I burned it first thing.

841
01:17:46,543 --> 01:17:50,130
I've been so silly.
Of course you did.

842
01:17:50,172 --> 01:17:51,632
It's alright.

843
01:17:52,382 --> 01:17:57,095
No, it's not alright. I hate it
for you to see me like this.

844
01:17:57,137 --> 01:17:59,431
I can't bare that I'm doubting you.

845
01:17:59,848 --> 01:18:02,601
I'm sorry.
Good night.

846
01:18:22,828 --> 01:18:27,625
[Narrator] Everybody was really against
any changes to Grace's working conditions at all

847
01:18:27,708 --> 01:18:30,627
when the subjuct occasionally
came up in conversation.

848
01:18:38,593 --> 01:18:42,931
Oh, Ben had declared in sympathy that
he wouldn't accept any more work than before,

849
01:18:43,056 --> 01:18:45,058
and Grace was grateful for that,

850
01:18:46,351 --> 01:18:49,062
even if he was a bit drunk
when he said so.

851
01:18:52,565 --> 01:18:59,030
Busy minute became busy hours,
and busy hours became busy days.

852
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:06,412
and irrespective of whether they thought
the idea of increasing Grace's services had
any fairness and justification to it or not,

853
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:09,582
it didn't seem to make anyone any happier.

854
01:19:09,707 --> 01:19:12,001
More to the contrary.

855
01:19:13,877 --> 01:19:17,506
Grace, oh.. You have to be more careful.

856
01:19:17,881 --> 01:19:21,718
Liz wasn't very careful either,
but she didn't break our glasses.

857
01:19:22,094 --> 01:19:28,141
I think you need to understand that Mr. Henson
works very hard to grind off any traces of moulds.

858
01:19:28,683 --> 01:19:32,687
and it makes the glass weak.
I thought you knew that.

859
01:19:32,771 --> 01:19:36,774
It won't happen again.
Of course, I'll pay for it.

860
01:19:37,525 --> 01:19:41,362
No, of course not. You don't have to
pay us for it. We'll get over it.

861
01:19:43,406 --> 01:19:49,453
[Narrator] And off she went to keep
her appointment with Chuck to free
the last tree trunks from the grass

862
01:19:49,453 --> 01:19:52,665
in order to keep the ever busy mice away.

863
01:19:53,457 --> 01:19:57,336
She was in a hurry and took the shortcut
between the gooseberry bushes,

864
01:19:57,377 --> 01:19:59,671
only to be brought up by a shout.

865
01:19:59,796 --> 01:20:01,715
- Grace!
- Yes!

866
01:20:04,468 --> 01:20:10,557
Oh, I didn't see that you just
raked the path. I'm sorry.

867
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:12,726
It isn't that I've just raked it.

868
01:20:12,934 --> 01:20:17,647
The idea is that people can pass
around the bushes completely.

869
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:19,857
I prefer it that way,
as you should know.

870
01:20:21,109 --> 01:20:26,614
I thought that these chains were put up
to make a path between the bushes.

871
01:20:26,614 --> 01:20:28,908
They were put up there to protect the bushes.

872
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:30,785
It is not supposed to be a pathway.

873
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:32,703
But everyone goes this way.

874
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:36,999
Dear, that's right.
They have been living here for years.

875
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:38,709
You haven't been here that long.

876
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:46,717
Are you saying, that I am less entitled
to use the shortcut
because I haven't always lived here?

877
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:47,592
No, of course not.

878
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:52,180
"No, I just thought it pleased you
to be here, that's all."

879
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:55,058
"Go on.
Go on, it's alright."

880
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:57,227
I'll see you this afternoon..

881
01:20:57,310 --> 01:21:02,357
"and I'll rake those bushes like they've
never been raked before, I promise."

882
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:14,243
I'm sorry about that branch.
There were so many apples on it.

883
01:21:16,161 --> 01:21:19,623
"I should have cut that brance,
but I got greedy."

884
01:21:20,874 --> 01:21:23,836
Is it greedy to want to feed your family?

885
01:21:29,549 --> 01:21:31,510
So how come you don't like me?

886
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:37,640
Why do you ask me that?

887
01:21:38,349 --> 01:21:40,351
"When I get close to you,
you edge away."

888
01:21:42,353 --> 01:21:45,273
"- No, I don't.
- You did so."

889
01:21:46,274 --> 01:21:48,943
When we were thinning the seedlings
in the bottom row.

890
01:21:50,111 --> 01:21:53,489
How am I supposed to show you what I do
if I ain't allow to touch you?

891
01:21:55,574 --> 01:21:57,493
You tried to kiss me.

892
01:22:05,959 --> 01:22:11,298
Vera never took any interest in the apples.
She hates the orchard.

893
01:22:13,008 --> 01:22:18,346
"The is the first time I've ever met anyone,
who understand about the apples."

894
01:22:19,472 --> 01:22:21,641
Sorry... it made me so happy.

895
01:22:25,895 --> 01:22:27,063
It's alright.

896
01:22:27,105 --> 01:22:32,109
"No, it ain't alright. I reckon the stuff
about the apples is just words in your mouth."

897
01:22:33,277 --> 01:22:35,571
If you can't really share my pleasure...

898
01:22:36,155 --> 01:22:37,406
I do.

899
01:22:38,657 --> 01:22:42,745
Vera wants me to picking apples
from trees that are barely in the ground.

900
01:22:43,662 --> 01:22:46,081
Things take time. That's love!

901
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:51,336
Seeing what they need and
respecting those needs.

902
01:22:51,461 --> 01:22:53,880
"If anyone understands that, it's you.
At least I thought so."

903
01:22:53,922 --> 01:22:55,298
I do understand that.

904
01:22:55,298 --> 01:22:57,551
But you edge away when I get close.

905
01:22:58,051 --> 01:23:01,888
- Why do you find me so repugnant?
- I don't find you repugnant.

906
01:23:04,015 --> 01:23:05,642
Don't be upset.

907
01:23:07,268 --> 01:23:11,439
I'm sorry if I doubted you.
It won't happen again.

908
01:23:13,482 --> 01:23:15,151
I promise you.

909
01:23:17,737 --> 01:23:20,531
I wouldn't make that promise if I were you.

910
01:23:26,704 --> 01:23:29,623
"When you fended me off,
a thought came into my mind"

911
01:23:29,832 --> 01:23:34,461
that made me ashamed.
A thought that you would hate me for.

912
01:23:35,379 --> 01:23:39,090
"I would never hate you, never."

913
01:23:44,137 --> 01:23:44,971
What?

914
01:23:47,473 --> 01:23:53,563
"Chuck, I've treated you unfairly.
It's alright to have angry 
thoughts."

915
01:23:55,523 --> 01:23:58,442
I thought of turning you in!

916
01:24:00,403 --> 01:24:02,988
I thought of blackmailing you
into respecting me.

917
01:24:12,664 --> 01:24:18,003
"It means that much to you?
It does, doesn't it?"

918
01:24:20,463 --> 01:24:23,425
"You've really been alone up here,
haven't you?"

919
01:24:23,967 --> 01:24:30,765
You haven't had anyone to comfort you
and I should ask you for forgiveness.

920
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,815
Still friends?

921
01:25:09,344 --> 01:25:12,472
- Sorry... Were you asleep?
- No.

922
01:25:13,473 --> 01:25:17,560
"- Do you want me to leave?
- No, I was just resting."

923
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:25,234
"Awful lot to do here in Dogville,
considering nobody needs anything done."

924
01:25:27,236 --> 01:25:30,614
Jason wants to sit on my lap all the time.

925
01:25:34,451 --> 01:25:37,412
I think you're doing a wonderful job.

926
01:25:39,164 --> 01:25:43,543
You give us all so much.
What Mr. McKay said...

927
01:25:43,585 --> 01:25:47,130
right on the button..
right on the button.

928
01:25:47,672 --> 01:25:50,675
He tried to put his hands on my knee today.

929
01:25:50,717 --> 01:25:54,554
"Oh, he is blind, after all.
Probably an accident."

930
01:25:57,932 --> 01:26:05,064
And Ma Ginger got angry at me
for running across the gravel path.

931
01:26:07,358 --> 01:26:10,903
"Well good. She gets angry at me,"

932
01:26:12,988 --> 01:26:15,491
which just means that you're one of us now.

933
01:26:15,574 --> 01:26:18,368
"You can see through it all, can't you?"

934
01:26:34,384 --> 01:26:37,595
"I'll tell you, I'm gonna be asleep
in two minutes."

935
01:26:37,929 --> 01:26:40,473
What if I don't want you to go to sleep?

936
01:26:40,807 --> 01:26:43,100
I don't think you have a choice tonight.

937
01:26:54,361 --> 01:26:56,530
"I do love you, Grace."

938
01:26:57,906 --> 01:27:04,121
"I'm glad you love me.
I love you, too. I really do."

939
01:27:08,458 --> 01:27:14,381
"No, I mean, I yearn for you
when I am not with you."

940
01:27:18,676 --> 01:27:22,638
I yearn for you even
when we're alone like this.

941
01:27:24,891 --> 01:27:31,814
"I yearn to be even closer to you...
to touch you, the way that people..."

942
01:27:31,856 --> 01:27:34,733
We have our whole lives ahead of us.

943
01:27:37,736 --> 01:27:41,949
The thing that I love about you is
that you don't demand anything of me.

944
01:27:42,074 --> 01:27:46,286
That we can just be together.

945
01:27:46,495 --> 01:27:47,662
Yeah.

946
01:27:49,748 --> 01:27:53,168
Yearning will only make it better.

947
01:28:00,508 --> 01:28:06,222
"Thank you for your words,
your wise wise words."

948
01:28:08,266 --> 01:28:10,017
You're welcome.

949
01:28:13,187 --> 01:28:14,772
Do you want your shoes off?

950
01:28:41,256 --> 01:28:45,677
"Jason, what are you doing here?
That's wrong."

951
01:28:47,011 --> 01:28:49,806
The words have to be divided differently.

952
01:28:52,141 --> 01:28:53,309
Stop it.

953
01:28:53,684 --> 01:28:56,312
How's that for dividing the words?

954
01:28:58,606 --> 01:29:01,066
This is not a good day.
Everybody should leave.

955
01:29:01,108 --> 01:29:04,528
"Everybody except Jason.
Jason, I wanna talk to you alone."

956
01:29:04,862 --> 01:29:08,115
What is it?
What's going on?

957
01:29:09,408 --> 01:29:13,912
I can be very bad.
I bet my pa told you.

958
01:29:13,912 --> 01:29:17,874
I don't think that.
I think there is another reason for this.

959
01:29:19,334 --> 01:29:24,380
"I'd love to have you on my lap all the time,
but I can't, not with the others here."

960
01:29:26,174 --> 01:29:29,886
"When somebody can't do all the things
they'd like to do for others,"

961
01:29:30,428 --> 01:29:33,723
sometimes the people they promised get mad.

962
01:29:35,016 --> 01:29:37,435
That's what Mrs. Henson says.

963
01:29:39,437 --> 01:29:40,521
"Yes, that's true."

964
01:29:40,563 --> 01:29:43,774
I suppose I know why you won't let
me sit in your lap anymore.

965
01:29:45,109 --> 01:29:47,361
- Why?
- Because I've been mean lately.

966
01:29:47,402 --> 01:29:51,657
"Oh, come on. I'm sure you have
your reasons for that."

967
01:29:52,157 --> 01:29:56,912
"I have been mean to the others, too,
even baby Achilles."

968
01:29:57,204 --> 01:30:00,290
And he's so tiny he can't put up a fight.

969
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:04,711
"- It's not right
- No, it's not."

970
01:30:04,836 --> 01:30:08,214
"I got it coming to me, I know."

971
01:30:08,923 --> 01:30:10,466
I deserve a spanking.

972
01:30:10,508 --> 01:30:13,886
What? I should hit you?
I'm not gonna do that.

973
01:30:14,846 --> 01:30:18,265
Your mother doesn't believe in
physical discipline. I'm not gonna hit you.

974
01:30:18,307 --> 01:30:22,853
I know. She'd be awful mad
if she found out you whipped me.

975
01:30:23,687 --> 01:30:25,940
"Oh, I just said I won't do that."

976
01:30:26,106 --> 01:30:32,988
"It's good having ma on your side, right?
It'd be pretty serious if she turned against you."

977
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:35,991
"I am the way I am.
If people in this town don't like me,"

978
01:30:36,033 --> 01:30:38,994
then there is nothing I can do about that.

979
01:30:39,828 --> 01:30:42,414
I feel bad I need to be punished.

980
01:30:42,539 --> 01:30:45,917
"The fact is, I wouldn't have any respect
for you if you don't give me a spanking."

981
01:30:45,959 --> 01:30:48,920
I don't care how much fun you think it would be.

982
01:30:48,962 --> 01:30:51,714
"I'm not gonna spank you, Jason."

983
01:30:52,715 --> 01:30:59,263
"In that case, when Ma gets home
maybe I'll just have to tell her you hit me."

984
01:30:59,388 --> 01:31:00,890
But I just said that I wouldn't!

985
01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:03,517
I reckon Ma'll take my word for it.

986
01:31:04,852 --> 01:31:08,314
"If you give me that spanking,
nobody's ever have to know."

987
01:31:14,111 --> 01:31:17,072
Stop it. Get away from Achilles.
Stop it.

988
01:31:17,948 --> 01:31:22,202
I gave his crib a shove.
It's not my fault it didn't tip over.

989
01:31:22,244 --> 01:31:25,080
Don't you touch him.
Move away from the crib.

990
01:31:25,163 --> 01:31:27,540
"Stop it, Jason. Stop it!"

991
01:31:27,665 --> 01:31:29,584
All right. You want a spanking.
I'll give you a spanking...

992
01:31:29,626 --> 01:31:31,753
Come here.
Come here!

993
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:37,550
- There! There we go.
- That wasn't hard.

994
01:31:37,884 --> 01:31:40,720
It's gotta be hard or it isn't punishment.

995
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:43,472
- All right.
- Harder!

996
01:31:45,766 --> 01:31:48,477
"Oh, this is... come on.
All right, that's enough."

997
01:31:48,644 --> 01:31:49,895
That is enough punishment now.

998
01:31:49,979 --> 01:31:53,565
Maybe I should go stand in the corner
and be ashamed?

999
01:31:53,607 --> 01:31:57,069
I don't care.. Stand in the corner.
Do whatever you gotta do.

1000
01:31:57,194 --> 01:31:58,779
"Hey, there is Pa!"

1001
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:05,202
He's early. I hope there is nothing wrong.

1002
01:32:05,243 --> 01:32:12,792
"[Narrator] Just as Dogville had done from
its open, frail shelf on the mountainside,
quite unprotected from any capricious storms,"

1003
01:32:12,917 --> 01:32:15,795
"Grace, too, had laid herself open."

1004
01:32:16,713 --> 01:32:22,093
And there she dangled from her frail stalk
like the apple in the Garden of Eden.

1005
01:32:22,468 --> 01:32:26,305
An apple so swollen that the juices almost ran.

1006
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:32,227
And once again the police
had come to Dogville.

1007
01:32:34,146 --> 01:32:39,776
"I said I'd tell you, to save Martha
the confusion about the ringing. But I forgot."

1008
01:32:39,818 --> 01:32:41,737
They're already down by Canyon Road.

1009
01:32:41,737 --> 01:32:45,031
The fellow in the other car is from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1010
01:32:45,073 --> 01:32:47,075
- You forgot!
- Yah.

1011
01:32:47,867 --> 01:32:49,869
"It is the busy time for the apples,
you know."

1012
01:32:49,869 --> 01:32:50,870
The FBI?

1013
01:32:51,746 --> 01:32:55,542
"They were most interested in hearing
what I'd seen in the past six months,"

1014
01:32:55,792 --> 01:32:58,378
anything related to that wanted poster.

1015
01:32:58,753 --> 01:33:04,342
They asked me if I'd seen any signs
in the woods of anyone camping out there.

1016
01:33:04,467 --> 01:33:07,261
God only knows
what that woman's capable of.

1017
01:33:07,345 --> 01:33:09,430
"You know, she is not capable of anything."

1018
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:15,436
"Well, that's what you say.
But it sure didn't sound that way coming from the laws."

1019
01:33:17,146 --> 01:33:19,648
That's why I felt I had to tell 'em
what I knew.

1020
01:33:22,359 --> 01:33:24,027
What did you tell them?

1021
01:33:24,569 --> 01:33:27,489
"Well, I thought I'd seen something
in the woods recently."

1022
01:33:27,948 --> 01:33:30,408
An item of clothing to be exact.

1023
01:33:30,575 --> 01:33:33,661
It turned out that it was just
an old hat Tom had lost.

1024
01:33:33,995 --> 01:33:36,873
- But it could've been this.
-  Chuck.. give me..

1025
01:33:36,873 --> 01:33:41,502
"Expensive, by the feel of it,
and your initials on it."

1026
01:33:44,714 --> 01:33:48,384
I imagine they'd draw the same conclusion
from this as anybody would.

1027
01:33:48,384 --> 01:33:53,139
I told the law it'd take me no time at all
to find this piece of clothing.

1028
01:33:54,014 --> 01:33:59,353
"I reckon we got us ten minutes, maybe fifteen,
'fore they start knocking on doors."

1029
01:33:59,603 --> 01:34:04,191
I wouldn't try to run away.
They are sure to see you.

1030
01:34:04,483 --> 01:34:06,318
"Why would I wanna run away, Chuck?"

1031
01:34:06,443 --> 01:34:08,278
"I wouldn't try to holler, either."

1032
01:34:08,278 --> 01:34:10,197
Why would I wanna do that?

1033
01:34:10,322 --> 01:34:12,365
It wasn't me who wanted you here.

1034
01:34:12,449 --> 01:34:15,076
You were far to beautiful and frail
for this place.

1035
01:34:16,619 --> 01:34:19,205
You tricked me into feeling that
I meant something to you.

1036
01:34:19,289 --> 01:34:21,791
"It's your own damn fault.
I need your respect, Grace."

1037
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:25,545
- You have my respect.
- I want your respect.

1038
01:34:25,670 --> 01:34:26,337
Don't...!

1039
01:34:40,559 --> 01:34:42,519
This is wrong..

1040
01:34:44,188 --> 01:34:49,901
"If I can force the flowers to bloom
early in spring, I can force you..."

1041
01:34:51,027 --> 01:34:52,571
Please...

1042
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:07,627
"Stop it!
Please.. Please... Please, don't!"

1043
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:10,504
Please! Please...

1044
01:35:11,088 --> 01:35:14,216
"Please look at me, talk to me."

1045
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:18,179
"We're friends, you and my family.."

1046
01:35:21,849 --> 01:35:23,434
Stop it!

1047
01:36:22,615 --> 01:36:24,325
Have you seen Grace?

1048
01:36:24,993 --> 01:36:26,578
She's at my place.

1049
01:36:27,036 --> 01:36:30,498
- Is she busy?
- Not anymore. Go right in.

1050
01:36:55,605 --> 01:37:02,195
[Narrator] Yet again Grace had made
a miraculous escape from her pursuers
with the aid of the people of Dogville.

1051
01:37:02,779 --> 01:37:07,325
"Everyone had covered up for her,
including Chuck, who had to admit"

1052
01:37:07,367 --> 01:37:12,747
that it was probably Tom's hat he'd
mistakenly considered so suspicious.

1053
01:37:27,803 --> 01:37:32,724
"That evening Tom had sensed at once
that something had taken place,"

1054
01:37:32,724 --> 01:37:37,229
but had to plead with Grace for ages
before she finally broke down

1055
01:37:37,437 --> 01:37:40,148
and unburdened herself.

1056
01:37:40,190 --> 01:37:42,359
- I have to confront him. I mean.
- No!

1057
01:37:42,484 --> 01:37:44,194
- I have no other choice.
- No.

1058
01:37:44,277 --> 01:37:47,280
- No one will accept what he did to you. No one.
- I don't want you to.

1059
01:37:47,405 --> 01:37:53,619
I came here with all these ideas
and these stupid prejudices.

1060
01:37:56,497 --> 01:38:00,042
"He is not strong, Tom."

1061
01:38:00,042 --> 01:38:02,545
"He looks strong, but he's not."

1062
01:38:04,422 --> 01:38:07,883
I'm gonna start looking for a way
to get you out of here.

1063
01:38:20,645 --> 01:38:22,814
[Narrator] The end of the summer had come.

1064
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:30,280
And in Elm Street the second clutch of
Dogville's scatty squirrels scooted in and out
of the legs of children and grown-ups alike

1065
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:34,367
searching in vain for Elm Street's non-existent elms.

1066
01:38:35,952 --> 01:38:42,291
"The heat had turned the soil among the gooseberry
bushes to stone, but Grace did not complain."

1067
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:44,543
"She threw herself into her work,"

1068
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:49,131
happy that it was something you could
actually grasp between your fingers.

1069
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:51,508
"Hey, Liz!
Hey, Vera!"

1070
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:54,928
"Better watch out, Grace.
Vera's got it in for you today."

1071
01:38:55,888 --> 01:38:57,764
What are you talking about?

1072
01:38:59,266 --> 01:39:01,768
Maybe you thought he wouldn't tell me?

1073
01:39:04,729 --> 01:39:05,856
Who?

1074
01:39:07,357 --> 01:39:09,651
You hit Jason.

1075
01:39:11,778 --> 01:39:13,029
I did.

1076
01:39:13,404 --> 01:39:15,823
How could you do such a thing?

1077
01:39:16,616 --> 01:39:20,953
"I know it sounds implausible,
but he was asking for it."

1078
01:39:21,496 --> 01:39:24,790
"It's true, Vera. He's always asking for it."

1079
01:39:26,792 --> 01:39:29,628
I should have done that myself
a long time ago.

1080
01:39:30,171 --> 01:39:32,506
"- Liz!
- It's your fault, the way you've spoiled him."

1081
01:39:32,631 --> 01:39:38,679
"I know how much you love him,
Vera. So do I..."

1082
01:39:39,012 --> 01:39:42,975
It won't happen again.
It really won't.

1083
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:47,854
"No. I know it won't, because I'll
never leave them with you again."

1084
01:39:48,605 --> 01:39:51,316
That'd be far too dangerous
for any child of mine.

1085
01:39:51,399 --> 01:39:52,859
I've been tired.

1086
01:39:52,901 --> 01:39:58,364
"Well, maybe you should see about
sleeping at night, like most folks do."

1087
01:39:58,489 --> 01:39:59,866
Sleeping at night?

1088
01:40:01,617 --> 01:40:10,668
Martha saw a certain Tom Edison Jr.
sneak out of her shed early this morning.

1089
01:40:15,589 --> 01:40:18,967
"Grace, you won't hear anything from me
about whipping that idiot kid."

1090
01:40:19,301 --> 01:40:23,513
And I'm also grateful to you for turning
Tom's wandering eye away from my skirts.

1091
01:40:24,222 --> 01:40:27,017
"But on the other hand, I'd expected
more from you than that."

1092
01:40:29,436 --> 01:40:32,814
"But if that's the kind of thing you're after,
then I'm sure, with your innocent look,"

1093
01:40:32,856 --> 01:40:35,650
you will do just fine
in a place like Dogville.

1094
01:40:35,734 --> 01:40:38,153
"- It's not what I'm after, Liz.
- Oh, no?"

1095
01:40:38,278 --> 01:40:42,990
We all saw you take his hand to the picnic.
Maybe that wasn't flirting?

1096
01:40:45,118 --> 01:40:48,829
Yes... Maybe I was flirting..

1097
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:04,178
[Narrator] Next day the weather changed.
The fog came rolling down from the mountains.

1098
01:41:04,386 --> 01:41:10,725
"And althought there were no sunsets to be seen,
McKay thought it best that she sat by him anyway."

1099
01:41:11,059 --> 01:41:14,562
"She had sat by Jack McKay so many times now,"

1100
01:41:14,688 --> 01:41:18,858
but Jack had not got better
at judging the distance between them.

1101
01:41:19,067 --> 01:41:23,946
"On the contrary, where fingers alone
had previously brushed her young flesh,"

1102
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:29,327
now it was a and that remained in place
throughout the allotted span.

1103
01:41:31,829 --> 01:41:36,459
"The hour in the orchard were long now,
for the harvest was under way."

1104
01:41:36,584 --> 01:41:42,589
"And Grace had long since given up arguing
with Chuck's perception that respect for cultivation,"

1105
01:41:42,631 --> 01:41:47,970
"harvest, and fruit could be directly
measured in provision of carnality."

1106
01:41:49,262 --> 01:41:54,351
"Though reluctant to leave Grace alone,
Tom wantered around quite often now,"

1107
01:41:54,434 --> 01:41:58,938
lost in thought as he tried to crack
the problem of possible escape.

1108
01:41:59,773 --> 01:42:05,445
"And as Grace's wages no longer found
their way to her purse he had stepped in,"

1109
01:42:05,486 --> 01:42:12,451
and together they had triumphantly picked up
the last of the seven figurines
from Ma Ginger's windows.

1110
01:42:22,336 --> 01:42:23,879
What's the matter?

1111
01:42:24,963 --> 01:42:28,675
- Nothing.
- Are the police on Canyon Road again?

1112
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:36,892
No. This is just girl talk.

1113
01:42:37,517 --> 01:42:41,563
"It's funny you should mention Canyon Road,
though... right, Martha?"

1114
01:42:41,646 --> 01:42:44,482
- She was just there this morning.
- Yeah.

1115
01:42:44,524 --> 01:42:48,444
"- On the way home from church...
- You see so much more on foot, you know."

1116
01:42:48,528 --> 01:42:53,741
"When you're in a car you never notice
the apple orchard, for example."

1117
01:42:56,535 --> 01:43:00,956
You can only see it from one spot
on Canyon Road.

1118
01:43:01,373 --> 01:43:05,002
"- Do you know that spot, Martha?
- Yes I do."

1119
01:43:06,670 --> 01:43:11,258
And did you stop there to enjoy
the view this morning?

1120
01:43:11,383 --> 01:43:14,970
"It's harvest time, you know,
in the orchard after all."

1121
01:43:15,095 --> 01:43:18,557
The old masters always loved
a good harvest theme.

1122
01:43:18,598 --> 01:43:27,524
"Redolent, with fertility, not to mention
sensibility or even eroticism."

1123
01:43:30,735 --> 01:43:36,157
"But how silly of me to ask you that, Martha,
because you already said you did."

1124
01:43:39,535 --> 01:43:41,829
"She saw you, Grace.."

1125
01:43:46,292 --> 01:43:49,336
She saw you..

1126
01:43:51,588 --> 01:43:54,883
behind this pile of broken limbs..

1127
01:43:56,468 --> 01:43:58,011
with Chuck...

1128
01:44:01,681 --> 01:44:05,977
He said it wasn't the first time
you'd made advances towards him.

1129
01:44:07,604 --> 01:44:12,066
He never told me before because
he wanted to spare my feelings.

1130
01:44:13,693 --> 01:44:18,906
"He's a withdrawn and primitive man,"

1131
01:44:21,659 --> 01:44:26,789
but at heart he's loyal
and he is good.

1132
01:44:26,830 --> 01:44:30,167
What do you want with my husband?

1133
01:44:31,585 --> 01:44:40,844
I don't want anything with
your husband or anybody.

1134
01:44:40,886 --> 01:44:43,555
What about Tom and the hand-holding
at the picnic?

1135
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:46,558
That's different. I like Tom.

1136
01:44:48,393 --> 01:44:50,562
But you don't like Chuck.

1137
01:44:50,645 --> 01:44:56,317
"Liz and Martha are behind me, when I tell you
that I'm going to have to teach you a lesson."

1138
01:44:56,317 --> 01:44:59,028
I believe in education.

1139
01:45:02,990 --> 01:45:03,658
Vera!

1140
01:45:03,991 --> 01:45:09,038
No. I believe smashing them is
less a crime than making them.

1141
01:45:10,914 --> 01:45:14,918
Vera.. remember how I taught your children..

1142
01:45:15,043 --> 01:45:18,922
"- What?
- Remember how happy you were, when I..."

1143
01:45:19,089 --> 01:45:22,843
- When you what?
- When I taught your children
about the doctrine of stoicism

1144
01:45:22,926 --> 01:45:25,136
and they finally understood it.

1145
01:45:27,055 --> 01:45:29,391
"All right.. For that, I'm gonna be lenient."

1146
01:45:29,391 --> 01:45:33,061
"I'm going to break two of your figurines first,"

1147
01:45:35,772 --> 01:45:45,364
"and if you can demonstrate your knowledge
of the doctrine of stoicism by holding back your tears,"

1148
01:45:45,698 --> 01:45:50,536
I'll stop.
Have you got that?

1149
01:46:03,882 --> 01:46:09,179
"[Narrator] In her lifetime Grace had
considerable practice at constraining her emotions,"

1150
01:46:09,179 --> 01:46:13,141
and would never have believed
it would be hard to control them now.

1151
01:46:14,350 --> 01:46:21,649
But as the porcelain pulverized on the floor
it was as if it were human tissue disintegrating.

1152
01:46:23,317 --> 01:46:28,072
The figurines were the offspring of
the meeting between the 
township and her.

1153
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:34,995
"They were the proof that in spite of everything,
her suffering had created something of value."

1154
01:46:35,746 --> 01:46:38,415
Grace could not longer cope.

1155
01:46:39,625 --> 01:46:45,172
"For the first time since her childhood,
she wept."

1156
01:47:14,617 --> 01:47:21,915
"Grace went to see Tom that very night,
and informed him that she was ready
to follow his advice and leave the township."

1157
01:47:22,916 --> 01:47:29,214
"And since Tom had just made up his mind
that a third party would be needed
to ensure the success of an escape,"

1158
01:47:29,423 --> 01:47:33,260
they agreed that Ben possessed
the greatest potential.

1159
01:47:34,594 --> 01:47:38,515
"But it was a case where money
was required, Tom concluded,"

1160
01:47:38,723 --> 01:47:45,605
"and estimated, that considering the times and all,
ten dollars would suffice for Ben and his truck."

1161
01:47:45,688 --> 01:47:48,816
- But we don't have ten dollars.
- No. We borrow it.

1162
01:47:50,735 --> 01:47:53,279
- From whom?
- From Dad.

1163
01:47:54,155 --> 01:47:56,532
He has more than that in the medicine closet.

1164
01:47:56,615 --> 01:47:59,201
I talk to him in the morning and arrange a loan.

1165
01:47:59,952 --> 01:48:01,620
But you have a word with Ben...

1166
01:48:01,745 --> 01:48:04,498
"It's the end of the week,
he's bound to be flat broke."

1167
01:48:05,958 --> 01:48:08,543
Tell your father that I will pay him back.

1168
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:10,379
Of course.

1169
01:48:15,091 --> 01:48:16,217
Thank you.

1170
01:48:19,804 --> 01:48:23,266
You are always rescuing me.

1171
01:48:27,061 --> 01:48:30,189
I can't believe that you go on
being there for me.

1172
01:48:32,984 --> 01:48:34,026
Good night..

1173
01:48:37,196 --> 01:48:38,739
You should get some sleep.

1174
01:48:47,956 --> 01:48:50,792
[Narrator] Grace went to see Ben next morning.

1175
01:48:55,088 --> 01:48:58,967
"When Grace presented the payment
as compensation between friends,"

1176
01:48:58,967 --> 01:49:01,386
"Ben did not object too heartily,"

1177
01:49:01,428 --> 01:49:07,016
considering the trouble he could receive
from the rest of the towns-people
when they realized what had happened.

1178
01:49:07,183 --> 01:49:10,520
"Perhaps they'd all be relieved
that she was out of their lives,"

1179
01:49:10,937 --> 01:49:14,398
but somehow Grace wasn't too sure of that.

1180
01:49:15,024 --> 01:49:21,739
"Ben agreed to drive her, even though he wasn't
out to profit from other folks' misfortunes, as he put it."

1181
01:49:21,739 --> 01:49:25,784
- I don't wanna profit from other folks' misfortunes.
- No..

1182
01:49:25,868 --> 01:49:30,581
[Narrator] The fact was that Ben would have driven
to the gates of Hell and back for ten dollars

1183
01:49:30,831 --> 01:49:34,960
And the criminal aspect bugged him less
than Grace would ever have guessed;

1184
01:49:35,043 --> 01:49:38,463
he had freighted all kinds of things
in his day.

1185
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,384
The plan was for Grace to hide
among the apples.

1186
01:49:42,509 --> 01:49:47,513
"Knowing the exact time to harvest is the
greatest art of all, Chuck had said,"

1187
01:49:47,722 --> 01:49:52,685
and the time had come
for the apples and for Grace.

1188
01:49:52,685 --> 01:49:54,687
"Grace, where've you been?"

1189
01:49:54,812 --> 01:49:58,774
If I'd displayed the same indifference
to the timing of my chores I'd be in for a whippin'

1190
01:49:58,816 --> 01:50:00,317
Now get a move on!

1191
01:50:01,110 --> 01:50:04,905
"I'm sorry, Olivia.
I had to talk to Ben about something."

1192
01:50:04,989 --> 01:50:06,323
June is near to bursting.

1193
01:50:06,448 --> 01:50:09,118
"She can't use the pot on her own,
as you well know."

1194
01:50:09,118 --> 01:50:12,996
It ain't fittin' to toy with her just 'cause
she's crippled and can't help herself.

1195
01:50:17,334 --> 01:50:25,508
"[Narrator] The evening before the escape
Tom tactically thought it best not to press
his desires of the flesh too hard upon Grace,"

1196
01:50:25,717 --> 01:50:30,096
and instead he adopted a more
sensitive approach.

1197
01:50:32,015 --> 01:50:38,312
But there is a right and a wrong time
to plant seeds and you can't plant seeds in the winter.

1198
01:50:39,563 --> 01:50:43,651
That's true.
But I love you...

1199
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:46,654
- I know.
- And you love me

1200
01:50:46,987 --> 01:50:49,990
and we will meet again in love
and in freedom.

1201
01:50:50,074 --> 01:50:51,867
Absolutely.

1202
01:50:52,910 --> 01:50:56,872
"I shouldn't be ashamed wanting you, should I?
It's nothing to be ashamed of."

1203
01:50:56,872 --> 01:50:58,123
No...

1204
01:50:59,374 --> 01:51:03,044
- No.
- No.. no. It's lovely. It's lovely that we want each other.

1205
01:51:05,046 --> 01:51:07,382
- But not this way.
- No.

1206
01:51:07,716 --> 01:51:09,509
It's not right.

1207
01:51:20,519 --> 01:51:25,316
"[Narrator] The next morning, when Grace
wanted to slip down to Ben's as invisibly as possible,"

1208
01:51:25,441 --> 01:51:30,446
it seemed to Grace that the entire township
was up and about at the same time.

1209
01:51:31,113 --> 01:51:33,490
"- Grace!
- Yes, Vera.."

1210
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:39,037
"If you think that by hitting my child you can
get out of working for me, think again."

1211
01:51:39,162 --> 01:51:40,956
"Why don't you just come by as planned,"

1212
01:51:40,956 --> 01:51:46,002
and we'll find something
where you won't be able to harm anyone.

1213
01:51:46,127 --> 01:51:49,047
- At twelve o'clock?
- Yes.

1214
01:51:49,214 --> 01:51:52,926
Why are you taking your copious
belongings around with you?

1215
01:51:53,134 --> 01:51:55,094
Afraid you are gonna loose them?

1216
01:51:55,303 --> 01:51:58,264
"Grace, Ben's hauling apples today
so we won't be loading glasses."

1217
01:51:58,598 --> 01:52:02,476
But that don't mean you're off work.
Dad wants you to repack the whole last load.

1218
01:52:03,185 --> 01:52:05,646
Maybe you can do it better
and we'll have an extra crate.

1219
01:52:06,188 --> 01:52:10,734
"An old crate like that may not have much
value in your eyes, but this is Dogville."

1220
01:52:11,026 --> 01:52:12,861
We're not wealthy here.

1221
01:52:13,862 --> 01:52:17,950
"And if your hands get a bit red, well,
I've got a tip about something you can rub on 'em."

1222
01:52:18,033 --> 01:52:21,078
"- Grace!
- Oh, Martha.."

1223
01:52:23,413 --> 01:52:25,999
We have to wash the flagstones
at the foot of the steps again.

1224
01:52:26,082 --> 01:52:28,793
Dirt has gone blown under the door.
I can't get the door open.

1225
01:52:28,835 --> 01:52:34,048
Where have you been?
Harvest is the holiest time of the year.

1226
01:52:34,632 --> 01:52:36,926
Does it not sound like something
you could have said?

1227
01:52:37,802 --> 01:52:43,015
"I'll be down in a minute, Chuck.
I'll bring the crates down."

1228
01:52:43,683 --> 01:52:44,559
Good.

1229
01:52:45,351 --> 01:52:47,561
"[Narrator] As Grace hastened to the garage,"

1230
01:52:47,687 --> 01:52:53,025
she grew more and more pleased with
the decision to keep her departure under wrap.

1231
01:52:54,068 --> 01:52:58,405
There was actually quite a bit of work
Dogville didn't need doing

1232
01:52:58,447 --> 01:53:02,618
that its residents would have to carry out
for themselves in future.

1233
01:53:03,702 --> 01:53:09,082
"Yeah, er, Grace, I don't like having to say this,
but I'd like to ask if I could have the money up front."

1234
01:53:09,791 --> 01:53:12,794
"See, it's always the way in the freight industry."

1235
01:53:12,836 --> 01:53:17,382
"Once you deliver a load you ain't got much
to bargain with, if you catch my drift."

1236
01:53:17,465 --> 01:53:19,342
Of course. Here's the money.

1237
01:53:19,425 --> 01:53:22,428
"Not that this is a professional job,
of course."

1238
01:53:22,470 --> 01:53:24,263
"- Don't get out...
- All right, Ben."

1239
01:53:24,847 --> 01:53:25,973
'till I give the say-so!

1240
01:53:47,202 --> 01:53:53,124
"[Narrator] Canyon Road snaked down the valley
and away, and Grace went too,"

1241
01:53:53,458 --> 01:54:00,590
and with every bend the township and its noises
faded ever more mercifully behind her.

1242
01:54:49,887 --> 01:54:51,764
- Is something wrong?
- Yeah.

1243
01:54:52,431 --> 01:54:55,810
There are a hell lot of.. a lot of police up ahead.

1244
01:54:57,478 --> 01:54:59,396
I wasn't expecting that.

1245
01:55:00,773 --> 01:55:05,986
It's more dangerous than I thought.
We'll have to go back.

1246
01:55:08,030 --> 01:55:09,948
No! we can't do that.

1247
01:55:11,742 --> 01:55:12,784
It's just....

1248
01:55:13,118 --> 01:55:20,125
"if this was a professional transport job,
you know, paid proper like...it'd be a lot easier, but..."

1249
01:55:22,335 --> 01:55:24,254
But it's been paid for...

1250
01:55:24,712 --> 01:55:32,511
"Yeah, but, in the freight industry carrying
dangerous load it cost more."

1251
01:55:33,512 --> 01:55:35,890
"A surcharge, they call it."

1252
01:55:37,016 --> 01:55:42,980
"If this were a professional job,
I could just charge you."

1253
01:55:45,482 --> 01:55:48,193
"But Bun, I don't have any more money."

1254
01:55:53,365 --> 01:55:55,992
"Oh, that's no good then."

1255
01:56:00,121 --> 01:56:07,337
"You said once, you said once,
that there aren't many pleasures in my life."

1256
01:56:10,298 --> 01:56:13,426
"And you know, I go to Miss Laura
once a week."

1257
01:56:14,844 --> 01:56:21,851
And you got me to see that it weren't
nothing to be ashamed of.

1258
01:56:26,522 --> 01:56:29,316
I was gonna go there tonight...

1259
01:56:31,818 --> 01:56:35,697
and of course it costs me.

1260
01:56:37,532 --> 01:56:41,786
"I mean, not as much as..."

1261
01:56:43,621 --> 01:56:51,462
"not as much as a surcharge
for dangerous goods, but  still..."

1262
01:56:54,173 --> 01:56:56,175
"it does cost me, you know."

1263
01:56:56,884 --> 01:56:59,553
"No, Ben, no... please don't.."

1264
01:57:00,096 --> 01:57:04,391
"It's not personal, Grace.
It's not personal. I just..."

1265
01:57:06,143 --> 01:57:08,937
"I have to take due payment, that's all."

1266
01:57:09,855 --> 01:57:12,983
I don't .. I don't have a choice.

1267
01:57:13,859 --> 01:57:17,070
I can't buck the freight in this big craft.

1268
01:57:20,615 --> 01:57:26,287
We're parked in the square in Georgetown.
Right outside the church.

1269
01:57:27,622 --> 01:57:29,791
You'd better keep your voice down.

1270
01:57:33,961 --> 01:57:35,546
"No, Ben..."

1271
01:57:35,630 --> 01:57:41,344
"This ain't somethin' I'm proud of, Grace.
Don't go thinking that."

1272
01:58:14,125 --> 01:58:22,383
"[Narrator] Grace fell asleep on the long highway,
thanks to her healthy ability to push
any unpleasantness around her far away."

1273
01:58:22,425 --> 01:58:27,596
"A generous God had blessed her with
the rare talent of being able to look ahead,"

1274
01:58:28,055 --> 01:58:30,057
and only ahead.

1275
01:58:31,642 --> 01:58:38,523
"And later when the truck slowed down
about to reach its destination and she slowly
returned to consciousness,"

1276
01:58:38,565 --> 01:58:42,194
she had no way of knowing how long she had slept.

1277
01:58:42,235 --> 01:58:47,115
All she knew was that she would be
happy to see the light of day again.

1278
01:58:49,617 --> 01:58:52,078
And then she heard the dog.

1279
01:58:57,875 --> 01:59:01,379
All your fondness for apples seems
less and less believable.

1280
01:59:02,213 --> 01:59:03,673
You've bruised 'em.

1281
01:59:16,518 --> 01:59:19,521
We had a meeting last night
at the mission house.

1282
01:59:21,898 --> 01:59:25,235
"They said you might be going to try to run away,"

1283
01:59:25,318 --> 01:59:29,906
"so when I discovered you'd hidden
yourself away on my truck,"

1284
01:59:31,324 --> 01:59:34,702
I didn't have no choice but
to bring you back to Dogville.

1285
01:59:36,454 --> 01:59:39,415
In the freight industry we can't take sides.

1286
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:28,879
"[Narrator] It didn't help Grace that the first theft
ever registered in Dogville had taken place
the previous evening,"

1287
02:00:28,921 --> 02:00:33,259
when most people were assembled
for the town meeting.

1288
02:00:33,717 --> 02:00:39,098
Old Tom Edison Senior had a considerable
sum of money stolen from his medicine closet

1289
02:00:39,139 --> 02:00:41,725
"and suspicion soon fell on Grace,"

1290
02:00:41,725 --> 02:00:46,730
who had apparently been planning an escape
that would surely require funding.

1291
02:00:47,105 --> 02:00:51,568
Grace chose to remain silent
in the face of these new charges.

1292
02:00:52,944 --> 02:00:58,908
"And then Bill, who had lately improved his
engineering skills to an astonishing degree,"

1293
02:00:59,159 --> 02:01:04,706
"had, by way of his first design, implemented
a kind of escape prevention mechanism."

1294
02:01:05,123 --> 02:01:11,087
"Beautiful it might not have been,
but effective he dared say it was."

1295
02:01:22,139 --> 02:01:26,602
"Grace, we don't like having to do this."

1296
02:01:27,394 --> 02:01:32,149
We don't have much of a choice
if we are to protect our community.

1297
02:01:32,482 --> 02:01:36,778
Could you... Do you mind moving?
Try moving.

1298
02:01:57,006 --> 02:01:58,132
It works.

1299
02:01:59,341 --> 02:02:05,681
We had to make this heavy enough so that
it can only move where the ground's level.

1300
02:02:05,848 --> 02:02:09,226
And the ground is level in town.

1301
02:02:14,439 --> 02:02:16,399
May I go now?

1302
02:02:22,155 --> 02:02:25,658
I have to figure out
how I'm going to get into my house.

1303
02:02:27,827 --> 02:02:31,497
"Or is that part of the punishment,
having to sleep outdoors?"

1304
02:02:31,956 --> 02:02:34,584
"No, no no Grace."

1305
02:02:34,625 --> 02:02:38,796
Don't think of this as punishment.
Not at all!

1306
02:02:39,797 --> 02:02:44,885
"Bill, he made the chain long enough
so that you can sleep in your bed."

1307
02:02:55,896 --> 02:02:57,439
"Grace, six o'clock."

1308
02:03:00,734 --> 02:03:03,028
"Yes, Mrs. Henson."

1309
02:03:31,722 --> 02:03:34,016
I couldn't run the risk of Dad turning me down.

1310
02:03:34,057 --> 02:03:36,810
"But, they think it was me that took the money."

1311
02:03:37,728 --> 02:03:39,771
'Cause I told them so.

1312
02:03:43,858 --> 02:03:45,694
You did what?

1313
02:03:46,361 --> 02:03:49,447
"First they suspected me, but then
I convinced them that it was you,"

1314
02:03:49,489 --> 02:03:52,241
since you were the one
using the medicine closet.

1315
02:03:53,701 --> 02:03:54,619
Why?

1316
02:03:55,161 --> 02:03:57,038
Because I'm here to do the thinking for you.

1317
02:03:57,079 --> 02:04:01,417
"If we are to have the slightest chance
of getting you out of 
here,"

1318
02:04:02,752 --> 02:04:05,629
they can never know how close we really are.

1319
02:04:07,256 --> 02:04:10,843
They can't know I'm trying to help you.

1320
02:04:13,011 --> 02:04:17,182
"If they knew it was me that took the money,
I wouldn't be here talking to you now."

1321
02:04:20,185 --> 02:04:22,729
"Please don't disappear, Tom."

1322
02:04:28,735 --> 02:04:30,445
I need you.

1323
02:04:33,531 --> 02:04:36,951
I'll break this one...
with some thinking.

1324
02:04:47,002 --> 02:04:54,510
"[Narrator] It was not Grace's pride that kept
her going during the days when fall came
and the trees were losing their leaves,"

1325
02:04:54,551 --> 02:04:59,931
"but more of the trance-like state that descends
on animals whose lives are threatened,"

1326
02:04:59,931 --> 02:05:04,311
"a state in which the body reacts mechanically,
in a low, tough gear,"

1327
02:05:04,311 --> 02:05:07,355
without too much painful reflection.

1328
02:05:07,397 --> 02:05:12,068
Like a patient passively letting
his disease hold sway.

1329
02:05:13,111 --> 02:05:20,576
"And now that Vera had received proof that it was
in fact Chuck who'd forced his attentions on Grace,"

1330
02:05:20,618 --> 02:05:22,954
she was meaner than ever.

1331
02:05:26,332 --> 02:05:31,837
"Had Grace had friends in Dogville
they, too, fell like the leaves."

1332
02:05:33,422 --> 02:05:40,387
The most towns-people of the male sex now
visited Grace at night to fulfill their sexual needs.

1333
02:05:41,805 --> 02:05:44,683
It had occurred to the children
to give the bell an extra ring

1334
02:05:44,766 --> 02:05:50,397
"every time such an act had been consummated,
much to Martha's confusion."

1335
02:05:52,524 --> 02:05:57,487
But since the chain had been attached
things had become easier for everyone:

1336
02:05:58,988 --> 02:06:02,825
"the harassments in bed did not have to be
kept so secret anymore,"

1337
02:06:02,825 --> 02:06:06,412
because they couldn't really be
compared to a sexual act.

1338
02:06:06,495 --> 02:06:11,417
"They were embarrassing in the way it is
when a hillbilly has his way with a cow,"

1339
02:06:11,459 --> 02:06:12,918
but no more than that.

1340
02:06:14,962 --> 02:06:16,839
Tom saw everything.

1341
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:22,219
"It pained him, and the sexual visits
were a particularly severe blow."

1342
02:06:28,975 --> 02:06:34,397
"But he supported her as best he could,
the way a spider supports,"

1343
02:06:34,439 --> 02:06:38,151
when it has been tangled
in its own web by the wind.

1344
02:06:39,193 --> 02:06:40,278
Tom!

1345
02:06:47,159 --> 02:06:50,037
Everything I tried to do went wrong.

1346
02:06:51,163 --> 02:06:54,458
I can't come up with the answe
I was looking for.

1347
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:59,254
"You'll come up with it, you'll see.
You're very clever."

1348
02:07:00,881 --> 02:07:05,886
- We provoked them.
- I wouldn't worry about it.

1349
02:07:10,932 --> 02:07:14,769
We provoked them.
Now it is time for us to provoke ourselves.

1350
02:07:14,853 --> 02:07:16,104
What do you mean?

1351
02:07:16,146 --> 02:07:20,900
"I mean, by showing them some trust."

1352
02:07:20,984 --> 02:07:25,363
"It all started with a meeting, so it will be
logical to end it with 
one, too."

1353
02:07:25,613 --> 02:07:29,825
You'll talk and they'll listen.
They can't refuse to listen.

1354
02:07:31,869 --> 02:07:35,539
- What will I say?
- Everything. You'll say everything.

1355
02:07:35,623 --> 02:07:38,542
"- Everything?
- Yeah, the truth. The Truth."

1356
02:07:38,542 --> 02:07:41,211
Just the truth about each and
every one of them.

1357
02:07:41,211 --> 02:07:43,464
I don't think they are gonna want to hear that.

1358
02:07:43,464 --> 02:07:49,511
"I know, I know. It is like a child
who doesn't want to take his medicine."

1359
02:07:50,929 --> 02:07:56,476
"They'll be furious at first, but in the end
they'll see it is for their own good."

1360
02:07:56,518 --> 02:08:00,396
Just don't be hateful. Don't be reproving.

1361
02:08:01,689 --> 02:08:04,317
"If anybody can do it,
Grace, you can."

1362
02:08:05,109 --> 02:08:12,658
They'll all realize that this weapon and
this understanding and injustice
has only one true victim and that's you.

1363
02:08:12,908 --> 02:08:16,704
And from there it is only
one small step to forgiveness.

1364
02:08:17,872 --> 02:08:23,002
"You've done some hard thinking, Tom Edison."

1365
02:08:23,752 --> 02:08:28,590
I'm sure it is an excellent plan.
I'm sure.

1366
02:08:47,984 --> 02:08:53,239
"[Narrator] If forgiveness was close at hand
in the mission house, they were all hiding it well."

1367
02:08:54,699 --> 02:08:57,535
It hadn't been easy for Tom to get them there.

1368
02:08:58,077 --> 02:09:04,124
Appealing to consciences stowed farther
and farther away by their owners every day

1369
02:09:04,249 --> 02:09:10,589
"as if they were as fragile as Henson's
glasses after polishing, had proved quite a task."

1370
02:09:11,256 --> 02:09:15,218
"But if one was going, the others
might as well come along, too,"

1371
02:09:15,260 --> 02:09:18,096
so nobody could talk behind anybody's back.

1372
02:09:20,265 --> 02:09:23,727
Tom had set the scene for Grace's speech.

1373
02:09:24,102 --> 02:09:29,649
"Now she'd have to sink or swim,
and sincerity be brought to bear."

1374
02:09:31,401 --> 02:09:36,197
While Grace addressed the silent congregation
in the mission house on Elm Street

1375
02:09:36,239 --> 02:09:40,451
the first of the early autumn snowstorms
embraced the town.

1376
02:09:41,035 --> 02:09:47,374
The snowflakes dusted down over the old
buildings as if this were just any old town.

1377
02:09:47,750 --> 02:09:51,837
"And they played in the brances and twigs
from which the apples had hung,"

1378
02:09:51,962 --> 02:09:56,717
but luckily the harvest was home and
via the freight industry had found a market

1379
02:09:56,758 --> 02:09:59,928
despite the ever disappointing prices.

1380
02:10:00,178 --> 02:10:03,139
Grace had presented her story with clarity.

1381
02:10:03,139 --> 02:10:06,267
She had not embellished or understated.

1382
02:10:06,267 --> 02:10:11,356
"And just as she finished the snowflakes
all at once stopped tumbling down,"

1383
02:10:12,148 --> 02:10:19,572
"leaving Dogville clad in the daintiest,
whitest blanket of snow imaginable."

1384
02:10:38,090 --> 02:10:40,342
I don't think it went very well.

1385
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:43,428
It's fine. You did good.

1386
02:10:51,477 --> 02:10:56,065
"[Narrator] The snow had come early,
perhaps too early."

1387
02:10:56,190 --> 02:10:59,527
A misplaced augury of conciliation.

1388
02:11:00,570 --> 02:11:03,364
"Tom looked around, worried:"

1389
02:11:03,406 --> 02:11:07,451
Vera's teeth were clenched.
She was the first to speak.

1390
02:11:07,493 --> 02:11:10,120
Copious lies. Just lies.

1391
02:11:10,162 --> 02:11:14,750
"Yes, Tom. It doesn't accord with the perceptions
I got of this town and its residents."

1392
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:19,588
"I'm a doctor, damn it, I don't need
anyone to tell me if I'm sick or not."

1393
02:11:19,588 --> 02:11:21,673
"What do you have to say for yourself, Tom?"

1394
02:11:21,882 --> 02:11:24,176
Maybe it's time you picked sides!

1395
02:11:24,801 --> 02:11:27,053
Are you for us or against us?

1396
02:11:27,095 --> 02:11:29,973
Liz is right. We've been
far too indulgent with Tom.

1397
02:11:30,014 --> 02:11:33,726
"Tom, I got to tell you.
Even I have trouble defending that girl."

1398
02:11:34,269 --> 02:11:38,773
"With your help, which I prefer to think
was accidental, Tom,"

1399
02:11:39,398 --> 02:11:46,197
she has managed to spread bitterness
and troubles throughout this whole town.

1400
02:11:46,238 --> 02:11:48,866
"She has to go.
How do we get rid of her, Tom?"

1401
02:11:48,866 --> 02:11:50,451
"So how do we do it, Tom?"

1402
02:11:50,492 --> 02:11:54,872
"I agree, Tom. You brought her in here.
You got to figure out how to get her out."

1403
02:11:54,913 --> 02:11:57,416
Without her lies and accusations spreading.

1404
02:12:00,419 --> 02:12:02,629
I asked you here to listen.

1405
02:12:05,715 --> 02:12:07,842
You only came to defend yourselves.

1406
02:12:08,301 --> 02:12:12,680
I'm sorry
it's quite a blow to me...

1407
02:12:14,015 --> 02:12:21,898
"to see all of my friends act this way,
so uncivilized."

1408
02:13:16,700 --> 02:13:20,412
"Your plan didn't work out very well, did it?"

1409
02:13:21,580 --> 02:13:24,207
"- You'll think of another one.
- No,"

1410
02:13:26,376 --> 02:13:29,421
"No more plans, I promise."

1411
02:13:34,801 --> 02:13:37,887
They asked me to choose between you and them.

1412
02:13:40,098 --> 02:13:43,518
That's not difficult on a day like today.
I love you.

1413
02:13:44,685 --> 02:13:51,525
"You may be stronger, it's true,
but the ideals, the ideals we share."

1414
02:13:52,735 --> 02:13:58,240
You're exhausted. Lie down.

1415
02:14:05,289 --> 02:14:11,044
"I've chosen, Grace.
I have chosen you."

1416
02:14:15,590 --> 02:14:20,470
Now it is the time!
The time we've been waiting for.

1417
02:14:25,516 --> 02:14:28,060
We free ourselves of Dogville.

1418
02:14:34,483 --> 02:14:41,031
"You're right. You're right, Tom.
It'd be so easy to make love right now."

1419
02:14:43,242 --> 02:14:49,122
They may kill us any minute..
It would be the perfect romantic ending.

1420
02:14:49,206 --> 02:14:51,875
I know. I feel it too. I love you.

1421
02:14:55,587 --> 02:14:58,298
"It would be so beautiful, but from ..."

1422
02:14:59,674 --> 02:15:04,429
"from the point of view of our love,
so completely wrong."

1423
02:15:08,599 --> 02:15:11,686
We were to meet in freedom.

1424
02:15:24,406 --> 02:15:26,700
"You're cold now, Grace."

1425
02:15:36,418 --> 02:15:40,880
I've just rejected everybody
I've ever known in your favor.

1426
02:15:43,216 --> 02:15:48,513
"Wouldn't it be worth compromising,
just one of your ideals just a little to ease my pain?"

1427
02:15:51,849 --> 02:15:55,102
"Everybody in this town has
had your body, but me."

1428
02:15:56,187 --> 02:15:58,647
We're the ones supposed to be in love.

1429
02:16:01,609 --> 02:16:03,944
My darling Tom.

1430
02:16:07,656 --> 02:16:10,784
You can have me if you want me.

1431
02:16:13,829 --> 02:16:16,289
Just do what the others do.

1432
02:16:17,666 --> 02:16:19,292
Threaten me...

1433
02:16:19,709 --> 02:16:25,548
"Tell me that you'll turn me in to the law,
to the gangsters and I promise you,"

1434
02:16:26,883 --> 02:16:30,386
you can take whatever it is you want from me.

1435
02:16:31,929 --> 02:16:33,890
I trust you...

1436
02:16:36,350 --> 02:16:40,021
but maybe you don't trust yourself?

1437
02:16:40,646 --> 02:16:47,194
"Perhaps you've been tempted, you've been
tempted to join the others and force me."

1438
02:16:47,194 --> 02:16:50,322
Perhaps that's why you're so upset.

1439
02:16:50,531 --> 02:16:53,116
All I've ever tried to do is help you.

1440
02:16:53,575 --> 02:16:58,330
I'm just asking if you're afraid
that you could be so human.

1441
02:16:58,455 --> 02:17:01,291
"No, I'm not afraid of that.
Not in the least."

1442
02:17:02,626 --> 02:17:04,294
Good.

1443
02:17:08,756 --> 02:17:11,843
Let tomorrow bring that it's gonna bring.

1444
02:17:14,429 --> 02:17:20,101
"It's not a crime to doubt yourself, Tom.."

1445
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:24,814
but it's wonderful that you don't.

1446
02:17:27,316 --> 02:17:29,360
I can't find the rest.

1447
02:17:32,529 --> 02:17:35,240
Maybe I should go out
for a couple of minutes.

1448
02:17:37,409 --> 02:17:39,870
Take a walk or something...
I don't know.

1449
02:17:42,372 --> 02:17:44,583
To get it all out of my system.

1450
02:17:46,960 --> 02:17:48,962
Trudge the streets..

1451
02:17:49,963 --> 02:17:53,967
Listen to the wind as it passes through
the woods up through the valley

1452
02:17:54,884 --> 02:17:56,427
and all that.

1453
02:18:00,640 --> 02:18:02,308
"You go to sleep, though..."

1454
02:18:06,103 --> 02:18:12,901
You go to sleep
and I will be back very soon.

1455
02:18:20,826 --> 02:18:23,745
[Narrator] Of course it was all a load of nonsense.

1456
02:18:23,829 --> 02:18:29,084
"If anybody was capable of keeping track
of ideals and reality, he was."

1457
02:18:29,209 --> 02:18:34,923
"After all, it was his job.
Moral issues were his home ground."

1458
02:18:35,798 --> 02:18:40,887
To think that he might doubt his own purity
was really to think very little of him.

1459
02:18:41,762 --> 02:18:44,181
Tom was angry.

1460
02:18:46,684 --> 02:18:50,271
"And in the midst of it all,
he discovered why."

1461
02:18:50,938 --> 02:18:54,024
"It was not because of he'd been wrongly accused,"

1462
02:18:54,066 --> 02:18:56,902
but because the charges were true!

1463
02:18:58,445 --> 02:19:04,159
His anger consisted of a most unpleasant
feeling of being found out!

1464
02:19:07,078 --> 02:19:10,332
It was all quite a blow to the young philosopher!

1465
02:19:10,332 --> 02:19:17,088
"And realistically enough, he thought
that if the doubt was already present, it could grow."

1466
02:19:17,130 --> 02:19:23,469
Perhaps so great that one day it would prove
detrimental to his entire moral mission.

1467
02:19:23,719 --> 02:19:25,930
Tom stopped.

1468
02:19:25,972 --> 02:19:31,393
He almost began to shake when the threat
to his career as a writer dawned upon him.

1469
02:19:31,477 --> 02:19:37,232
It didn't take him long to agree with himself
that the risk was too great to run.

1470
02:19:37,232 --> 02:19:41,904
The danger Grace was to the town
she was also to him!

1471
02:19:42,070 --> 02:19:44,239
Tom did not like it.

1472
02:19:44,281 --> 02:19:48,368
And he was man enough
to take action to prevent it.

1473
02:19:50,829 --> 02:19:57,502
Fortunately Tom was as conscientious
as regards his future profession as he was practical.

1474
02:19:57,544 --> 02:20:01,756
"He allowed sincerity and ideals
plenty of room in his life,"

1475
02:20:01,798 --> 02:20:05,635
"without getting ""sentimental"" about it,
as he would put it."

1476
02:20:06,511 --> 02:20:15,477
"Throwing away a document that might be
of significance to Tom and with him future generation
of readers as the basis of a novel or indeed a trilogy,"

1477
02:20:15,644 --> 02:20:19,148
"was not an act he was so stupid to commit,"

1478
02:20:19,148 --> 02:20:24,236
although he had to admit that in a moment
of weakness he might have said he would.

1479
02:20:27,739 --> 02:20:34,454
"Before returning to the meeting that night
Tom opened the little drawer he had open
the night of Grace's arrival,"

1480
02:20:35,205 --> 02:20:37,248
and found it still there:

1481
02:20:37,582 --> 02:20:40,460
the card from the gangster in the car.

1482
02:21:01,730 --> 02:21:05,484
"[Narrator] The next day the sun was shining
in the brisk autumn sky,"

1483
02:21:05,609 --> 02:21:08,111
and the snow was long since gone.

1484
02:21:10,155 --> 02:21:14,409
For the first time for ages the pile driver
could be heard in the marshlands

1485
02:21:14,451 --> 02:21:20,832
as it hammered in the piles for what might
or what might not be a penitentiary.

1486
02:21:20,999 --> 02:21:27,213
"Grace opened her eyes after an almost
unconscious sleep, and was confused."

1487
02:21:27,255 --> 02:21:32,343
"Judging by the light coming through the cracks
in the walls, it had to be nearly midday."

1488
02:21:32,426 --> 02:21:37,640
"The grey hour as Jack McKay
for some reason called noon in Dogville,"

1489
02:21:37,807 --> 02:21:45,064
"being a man of many ideas and proclivities,
quite a few of which Grace would prefer to remain ignorant of."

1490
02:21:45,981 --> 02:21:48,525
But why had nobody roused her?

1491
02:21:48,525 --> 02:21:50,902
Nobody had hammered furiously at her door.

1492
02:21:50,944 --> 02:21:56,199
Not a child had thrown mud into her bed
or broken her remaining windowpanes.

1493
02:21:57,200 --> 02:21:59,536
Now she remembered.

1494
02:21:59,536 --> 02:22:04,874
"She recalled the meeting the previous day,
and puzzled still more."

1495
02:22:05,166 --> 02:22:10,755
Why had she not been confronted with
the outcome of that meeting? Or even killed?

1496
02:22:11,339 --> 02:22:16,010
It was quite unlike Dogville to restrain
its indignation at any point.

1497
02:22:16,218 --> 02:22:19,388
Perhaps things had turned out well after all?

1498
02:22:19,388 --> 02:22:22,766
"- Good morning, Mrs. Henson.
- Oh.. good morning?"

1499
02:22:22,808 --> 02:22:27,813
I would have come earlier. I overslept.

1500
02:22:27,980 --> 02:22:31,358
"Oh, never mind.
Liz put her back into it htis morning."

1501
02:22:32,818 --> 02:22:35,737
We thought some time off would be good for you.

1502
02:22:39,241 --> 02:22:41,493
That was quite a speech you made yesterday.

1503
02:22:41,785 --> 02:22:44,245
It gave us all something to think about.

1504
02:22:48,416 --> 02:22:51,002
"- Hello, Liz!
- Hi, Grace.."

1505
02:22:58,217 --> 02:23:00,511
I overslept.

1506
02:23:01,429 --> 02:23:04,848
- Good morning Miss Grace?
- Good morning..

1507
02:23:04,848 --> 02:23:08,936
- How are you this morning?
- I overslept.

1508
02:23:08,936 --> 02:23:11,063
"Oh, that's all right."

1509
02:23:17,027 --> 02:23:20,614
"Tom. Tom, I think it's Grace."

1510
02:23:21,198 --> 02:23:26,703
"Hello, Grace. Two seconds..
Good news."

1511
02:23:35,294 --> 02:23:37,713
I went back to the meeting last night.

1512
02:23:39,548 --> 02:23:42,385
I wasn't going to let them get off so easily.

1513
02:23:44,220 --> 02:23:47,056
But I'll be damned if the mood hadn't changed.

1514
02:23:48,349 --> 02:23:52,895
"I wouldn't say we won exactly, not exactly,
but I think something very good can come out of this,"

1515
02:23:53,020 --> 02:23:55,188
- something very good.
- Why didn't you come back and tell me?

1516
02:23:55,230 --> 02:23:58,317
"I did, but you were asleep."

1517
02:23:58,775 --> 02:24:01,236
"And you know,
you looked like you needed it.."

1518
02:24:02,487 --> 02:24:05,699
and that made me suggest
that maybe you should have some time off.

1519
02:24:05,740 --> 02:24:10,703
"And you know,
not one single person objected."

1520
02:24:14,916 --> 02:24:16,626
That sounds wonderful.

1521
02:24:16,751 --> 02:24:18,711
"I know it does, doesn't it?"

1522
02:24:19,420 --> 02:24:22,840
The people of this town
they surprise me again and again.

1523
02:24:24,216 --> 02:24:27,720
I might even have to revise
my theories a little bit.

1524
02:24:27,761 --> 02:24:30,264
You know how much I hate
doing that kind of thing.

1525
02:24:32,558 --> 02:24:40,982
"You know, Grace, last night when I came back
and I saw you lying there asleep so sweetly,"

1526
02:24:41,358 --> 02:24:46,780
I was suddenly inspired.
I wrote the first chapter of a story.

1527
02:24:46,905 --> 02:24:49,240
A story about a small town.

1528
02:24:49,824 --> 02:24:51,868
Guess where I got the inspiration?

1529
02:24:52,702 --> 02:24:55,705
But I haven't come up with a name
for the town yet.

1530
02:24:56,873 --> 02:24:59,917
- Why not just call it Dogville?
- Wouldn't work.

1531
02:25:00,668 --> 02:25:05,006
"No, it wouldn't work. It's got to be universal.
Lot of writers make that mistake, you see."

1532
02:25:05,756 --> 02:25:07,925
"Hey, do you want me to read it to you?"

1533
02:25:08,509 --> 02:25:11,095
"If there is any love in it, it comes from you..."

1534
02:25:11,136 --> 02:25:14,056
"Would you be offended, if I said no?"

1535
02:25:15,140 --> 02:25:19,519
"- No.
- If I really do have the day to myself, I..."

1536
02:25:19,853 --> 02:25:22,272
No. No..

1537
02:25:23,732 --> 02:25:28,069
Two people only hurt each other if they
doubt the love they have for one another.

1538
02:25:29,863 --> 02:25:31,865
You can read it some other time.

1539
02:25:33,408 --> 02:25:37,495
You sit down some place
and gaze out at the mountains.

1540
02:25:37,829 --> 02:25:39,914
It's what the girl in my novel does.

1541
02:25:43,292 --> 02:25:46,921
- I'll see you later.
- I'll see you. Good news!

1542
02:25:52,384 --> 02:25:57,389
"[Narrator] Sensibly, Grace chose to hope
for the best rather than fear the worst,"

1543
02:25:57,473 --> 02:26:01,685
"and planned to spend the day calmly
washing her clothes and herself,"

1544
02:26:01,727 --> 02:26:09,359
"which, for some reason or another, she was sure
none of the characters from Tom's
fictitious township would dream of doing."

1545
02:26:12,946 --> 02:26:16,991
And then it was as if Dogville just waited.

1546
02:26:18,076 --> 02:26:23,372
"Even the wind dropped,
leaving the town in an unfamiliar calm."

1547
02:26:24,248 --> 02:26:28,377
"as if somebody had put a large
cheese dish cover over it,"

1548
02:26:29,170 --> 02:26:34,091
and created the kind of quietness
that descends while you are awaiting visitors.

1549
02:26:36,343 --> 02:26:43,642
"After two days off Grace had been put back
to work, but the quietness remained."

1550
02:26:43,892 --> 02:26:52,859
Indeed it intensified until on the fifth day
it swelled into a strange mood

1551
02:26:52,901 --> 02:26:57,030
"that, all of a sudden, brought all the citizens
to the street to listen."

1552
02:26:59,574 --> 02:27:03,244
"They asked each other
if the phone was really still down,"

1553
02:27:03,578 --> 02:27:08,499
or if they'd heard about Ben having had to turn
his truck around on his way to Georgetown

1554
02:27:08,541 --> 02:27:13,003
that very morning on account
of a large tree blocking the road.

1555
02:27:13,337 --> 02:27:15,297
They were not worried.

1556
02:27:15,673 --> 02:27:21,887
"worried was not the right word,
and then Tom spotted the cars."

1557
02:27:23,931 --> 02:27:26,016
Tom has binoculars.
But you can see 'em with the naked eyes.

1558
02:27:26,099 --> 02:27:27,684
There must be at least eight!

1559
02:27:27,684 --> 02:27:29,353
I thought the road was blocked.

1560
02:27:29,394 --> 02:27:31,688
They must have come through
before the tree came down.

1561
02:27:34,774 --> 02:27:38,445
June's bed! The sheets need changing.
I'll be there in a minute.

1562
02:27:39,446 --> 02:27:40,697
"Hello, June."

1563
02:27:43,032 --> 02:27:47,161
"[Narrator] Grace had just started on the bed,
which June had soiled yet again,"

1564
02:27:47,495 --> 02:27:52,124
when an irritating feeling of wasting her time
forced itself upon her.

1565
02:27:53,334 --> 02:27:56,670
And it was without thinking
she then said the words:

1566
02:27:56,796 --> 02:27:59,131
Nobody gonna sleep here.

1567
02:28:04,136 --> 02:28:06,763
"[Narrator] She didn't say them out loud,"

1568
02:28:06,763 --> 02:28:11,977
but even so she was startled by the uttrance
that had urged itself upon her.

1569
02:28:13,728 --> 02:28:17,023
Where had these ominous words come from?

1570
02:28:26,324 --> 02:28:31,204
Darkness was falling as Grace made
her way home from work that evening.

1571
02:28:31,412 --> 02:28:37,001
The people on the square overlooking the valley
had finally given up hope of seeing anything else

1572
02:28:37,043 --> 02:28:39,086
now the light had faded.

1573
02:28:39,128 --> 02:28:42,590
They trudged up Elm Street in disappointment.

1574
02:28:47,261 --> 02:28:48,887
"- Tom?
- Hi, Grace."

1575
02:28:48,887 --> 02:28:53,809
"There were some cars, but it's too dark,
we can't see any more."

1576
02:28:53,934 --> 02:28:56,728
We haven't seen much of each other.

1577
02:28:57,312 --> 02:29:00,357
"Yah, I know. I've been busy
with my book, you know."

1578
02:29:00,357 --> 02:29:02,150
Can I ask you something?

1579
02:29:03,026 --> 02:29:04,652
"Yeah, anything."

1580
02:29:08,197 --> 02:29:11,075
"You couldn't bring yourself
to throw it away, could you?"

1581
02:29:12,743 --> 02:29:16,205
The number he gave you that night.
You couldn't throw it away.

1582
02:29:16,497 --> 02:29:21,502
I told yhou how dangerous that man was.
That was stupid.

1583
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:34,097
"[Narrator] Stupid or not, Tom was soon
a passionate spokesman for locking Grace
in her shed that night."

1584
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:40,395
If the vehicles were indeed a sign
that the call Tom had placed five days earlier

1585
02:29:40,478 --> 02:29:45,191
on be half of the community to the number
indicated on the card from his bureau drawer

1586
02:29:45,316 --> 02:29:47,277
"had at last led to action,"

1587
02:29:47,318 --> 02:29:50,530
"and Grace was now to be eliminated from their lives,"

1588
02:29:50,571 --> 02:29:54,784
it would surely look good
if the town had also locked her up.

1589
02:29:56,953 --> 02:30:00,956
Grace was lying on the bed
when Jason was sent up with the key.

1590
02:30:01,165 --> 02:30:03,709
"Grace heard it turn in the lock,"

1591
02:30:03,751 --> 02:30:12,009
but she was deeply absorbed by arguments
and thoughts on matters she had otherwise
avoided for the best part of a 
year now.

1592
02:30:30,777 --> 02:30:35,156
From the moment when they'd finally heard
the sound of vehicles starting one after the other

1593
02:30:35,198 --> 02:30:37,283
"from the direction of the edge of the woods,"

1594
02:30:37,325 --> 02:30:39,827
things had moved rapidly.

1595
02:30:40,286 --> 02:30:44,165
Tom had arranged a delegation
to provide a proper reception.

1596
02:30:44,915 --> 02:30:50,337
"Dogville might be off the beaten track,
but it was hospitable, nevertheless."

1597
02:31:03,350 --> 02:31:05,477
Welcome gentlemen. Welcome.

1598
02:31:05,602 --> 02:31:08,063
The town places itself at your disposal!

1599
02:31:08,104 --> 02:31:11,316
I should have a large key to give to you.
But I only have this small one.

1600
02:31:11,357 --> 02:31:13,610
- Where is she?
- Secured by this very key.

1601
02:31:13,651 --> 02:31:15,194
Where is she?

1602
02:31:15,612 --> 02:31:18,823
Okay. If you are wondering about that sound.

1603
02:31:18,865 --> 02:31:22,285
The driving piles for the new penitentiary.

1604
02:31:22,326 --> 02:31:27,289
"Tell me, has the crime rate really gone up
in this country, as we are lead to believe?"

1605
02:31:27,331 --> 02:31:33,671
"Maybe people just regard things as criminal,
because they envy their success?"

1606
02:31:33,712 --> 02:31:37,508
What's your opinion on the subject?

1607
02:31:38,133 --> 02:31:42,721
Maybe you have none.
I'll get the door... sorry.

1608
02:31:45,390 --> 02:31:48,476
Voila! As the French might say.

1609
02:31:48,685 --> 02:31:50,311
What the hell is this?

1610
02:31:50,729 --> 02:31:52,230
Who did that?

1611
02:31:52,313 --> 02:31:54,983
"Billy, put your hand up,
put your hand up."

1612
02:32:03,658 --> 02:32:08,746
"We felt safer, when she had the chain on.
You are probably more adapted at handling her kind."

1613
02:32:10,915 --> 02:32:16,295
None of us feel able to accept money
for just helping people.

1614
02:32:16,378 --> 02:32:21,008
I mean not unless it would make you
feel better to diverst yourself.

1615
02:32:21,008 --> 02:32:23,343
- Shut the hell up!
- Absolutely.

1616
02:32:27,931 --> 02:32:34,687
"[Narrator] Grace was no expert in exclusive
automobiles, yet she recognized with no difficulty"

1617
02:32:34,687 --> 02:32:39,734
the sound of vehicle that was rounding the corner
from Canyon Road at that very moment.

1618
02:32:40,985 --> 02:32:48,909
"Alas, in Grace's memory the legendary purr
of the Cadillac series 355C was inextricably linked"

1619
02:32:48,993 --> 02:32:52,621
"with another, rather less sophisticated sound:"

1620
02:32:52,830 --> 02:32:56,750
that of gunfire directed against her person.

1621
02:33:20,732 --> 02:33:21,941
Don't..!

1622
02:33:46,340 --> 02:33:50,302
You need to justify your actions
before you shoot us.

1623
02:33:51,678 --> 02:33:53,680
That's new.

1624
02:33:57,726 --> 02:34:01,896
"That could be interpreted as weakness,
Daddy... I'm disappointed in you!"

1625
02:34:02,939 --> 02:34:04,232
I'm not gonna shoot anybody.

1626
02:34:04,232 --> 02:34:06,401
You shot at me before.

1627
02:34:06,776 --> 02:34:12,782
"Yes, I'm sorry. I regret that."

1628
02:34:13,199 --> 02:34:14,950
You ran away.

1629
02:34:15,326 --> 02:34:19,622
But shooting at you certainly
didn't help matters.

1630
02:34:19,747 --> 02:34:22,916
"Of course not.
You're far, far too stubborn."

1631
02:34:25,586 --> 02:34:28,005
"If you don't want to kill me,
then why did you come?"

1632
02:34:28,005 --> 02:34:32,676
"Our last conversation, the one in which
you told me what it was you didn't like about me"

1633
02:34:32,717 --> 02:34:36,221
"never really concluded, as you ran away."

1634
02:34:36,263 --> 02:34:39,766
I should be allowed to tell you
what I don't like about you.

1635
02:34:39,766 --> 02:34:45,605
That I believe would be
a rule of polite conversation.

1636
02:34:45,730 --> 02:34:47,899
That's why you showed up?

1637
02:34:50,776 --> 02:34:53,154
And you call me stubborn.

1638
02:34:53,404 --> 02:34:57,575
You're sure you're not here to force me
to go back and become like you?

1639
02:34:57,783 --> 02:35:04,164
"If I thought there was a chance of forcing you,
but of course that will never happen."

1640
02:35:04,581 --> 02:35:12,673
You are more than welcome to return home
and become my daughter again anytime

1641
02:35:12,881 --> 02:35:22,932
and I would even begin to share my power
and responsibility with you if you did.

1642
02:35:23,141 --> 02:35:25,852
Not that you care.

1643
02:35:25,977 --> 02:35:27,478
So what is it?

1644
02:35:27,937 --> 02:35:31,065
"What is it, the thing... 
the thing that you don't like about me?"

1645
02:35:31,107 --> 02:35:33,568
It was a word you used that provoked me.

1646
02:35:33,609 --> 02:35:36,153
You called me arrogant.

1647
02:35:36,404 --> 02:35:40,324
"To plunder, as it were, a God given right.
I'd call that arrogant, daddy."

1648
02:35:40,366 --> 02:35:43,577
But that is exactly what I don't like about you.

1649
02:35:43,619 --> 02:35:45,329
It is you that is arrogant.

1650
02:35:45,412 --> 02:35:47,664
That's what you came here to say?

1651
02:35:51,084 --> 02:35:54,713
"I'm not the one passing judgement, Daddy.
You are."

1652
02:35:55,797 --> 02:36:00,260
"You do not pass judgement,
because you sympathize with them."

1653
02:36:00,302 --> 02:36:07,142
"A deprived childhood and a homicide
really isn't necessarily a homicide, right?"

1654
02:36:07,684 --> 02:36:10,395
The only thing you can blame is circumstances.

1655
02:36:10,436 --> 02:36:15,274
"Rapists and murderers may be the victims,
according to you."

1656
02:36:15,358 --> 02:36:18,611
"But I, I call them dogs,"

1657
02:36:18,653 --> 02:36:22,907
and if they're lapping up their own vomit
the only way to stop them is with the lash.

1658
02:36:22,948 --> 02:36:25,201
But dogs only obey their own nature.

1659
02:36:25,242 --> 02:36:27,786
So why shouldn't we forgive them?

1660
02:36:28,120 --> 02:36:31,081
"Dogs can be taught many useful things,"

1661
02:36:31,206 --> 02:36:36,461
but not if we forgive them
every time they obey their own nature.

1662
02:36:48,014 --> 02:36:53,227
So I'm arrogant. I'm arrogant
because I forgive them?

1663
02:36:53,269 --> 02:36:54,520
My God..

1664
02:36:54,771 --> 02:36:58,691
Can't you see how condescending
you are when you say that?

1665
02:36:59,150 --> 02:37:07,741
"You have this preconceived notion
that nobody, listne, that nobody can't possibly attain"

1666
02:37:07,783 --> 02:37:11,995
"the same high ethical standards as you,
so you exonorate them."

1667
02:37:12,079 --> 02:37:17,209
I can not think of anything
more arrogant than that.

1668
02:37:17,251 --> 02:37:23,465
"You, my child... my dear child
you forgive others with excuses"

1669
02:37:23,548 --> 02:37:26,301
that you would never in the world
permit for yourself.

1670
02:37:26,301 --> 02:37:29,012
Why shouldn't I be merciful?
Why?

1671
02:37:29,054 --> 02:37:34,392
"No no no.. You should be merciful,
when there is time to be merciful."

1672
02:37:34,517 --> 02:37:39,981
But you must maintain your own standard.
You owe them that. You owe them that.

1673
02:37:40,773 --> 02:37:47,029
"The penalty you deserve for your transgressions,
they deserve for their transgressions."

1674
02:37:47,071 --> 02:37:48,531
They are human beings.

1675
02:37:48,531 --> 02:37:52,993
No no no.. Does every human being
need to be accountable for their action?

1676
02:37:53,035 --> 02:37:55,871
Of course they do.
But you don't even give them that chance.

1677
02:37:55,913 --> 02:37:58,498
All that is extremely arrogant.

1678
02:37:58,498 --> 02:38:01,877
I love you. I love you. I love you to death.

1679
02:38:02,252 --> 02:38:06,172
But you are the most arrogant person
I've ever met.

1680
02:38:06,214 --> 02:38:08,425
And you call me arrogant!

1681
02:38:12,512 --> 02:38:16,557
I have no more to say.

1682
02:38:19,394 --> 02:38:23,397
You are arrogant. I'm arrogant.
You've said it. Now you can leave.

1683
02:38:23,397 --> 02:38:26,192
"And without my daughter, I suppose?"

1684
02:38:32,156 --> 02:38:34,575
"- I said, without my daughter?
- Hmm, yes!"

1685
02:38:35,993 --> 02:38:38,662
- Well..
- Yes.

1686
02:38:38,745 --> 02:38:48,964
"Well, you decide. you decide...
Grace, they say you are having some trouble here."

1687
02:38:49,673 --> 02:38:54,344
No. No more trouble than back home.

1688
02:38:54,594 --> 02:38:57,055
I'll give you a little time to think about this.

1689
02:38:57,096 --> 02:39:00,224
- Perhaps you will change your mind.
- I won't.

1690
02:39:00,516 --> 02:39:04,937
"Listen, my love.. power is not so bad..."

1691
02:39:05,021 --> 02:39:11,694
I am sure that you can find a way
to make use of it in your own fashion...

1692
02:39:14,738 --> 02:39:16,740
Take a walk and think about it.

1693
02:39:17,533 --> 02:39:28,877
The people who live here are doing their
best under very hard circumstances.

1694
02:39:28,960 --> 02:39:31,004
"If you say so, Grace."

1695
02:39:32,839 --> 02:39:39,971
But is their best really good enough?

1696
02:39:41,848 --> 02:39:43,057
Do they love you?

1697
02:39:53,317 --> 02:39:56,654
Grace had already thought for a long time.

1698
02:39:56,695 --> 02:40:00,741
She had known that if she were not shot
when the gangsters arrived

1699
02:40:00,741 --> 02:40:04,244
"she would be faced with her father's
suggestion that she return, to become"

1700
02:40:04,328 --> 02:40:09,249
a conspirator with him and his gang of
thugs and felons and she did not need any walk

1701
02:40:09,249 --> 02:40:11,918
"to reconsider her response to that,"

1702
02:40:12,919 --> 02:40:18,925
even though the difference betwen the people
she knew back home and the people
she'd met in Dogville had proven

1703
02:40:18,967 --> 02:40:22,136
somewhat slighter than she'd expected.

1704
02:40:23,346 --> 02:40:28,309
Grace looked at the gooseberry bushes
so fragiles in the smooth darkness.

1705
02:40:28,392 --> 02:40:31,771
"It was good to know
that if you did not treat them ill,"

1706
02:40:31,896 --> 02:40:37,318
"they would be there, come sping as always,
and come summer they'd again be bursting"

1707
02:40:37,359 --> 02:40:43,031
"with the quite incomprehensible quantity
of berries that were so good in pies,"

1708
02:40:43,115 --> 02:40:45,200
specially with cinnamon.

1709
02:40:46,869 --> 02:40:50,163
Grace looked around at the frightened faces
behind the windowpanes

1710
02:40:50,247 --> 02:40:56,211
"that were following her every step, and felt
ashamed of being part of inflicting that fear."

1711
02:40:57,962 --> 02:41:02,717
How could she ever hate them for
what was at bottom merely their weakness?

1712
02:41:03,092 --> 02:41:06,763
She would probably have done things
like those that had befallen her

1713
02:41:06,888 --> 02:41:09,390
"if she'd lived in one of these houses,"

1714
02:41:09,474 --> 02:41:13,352
to measure them by her own yardstick
as her father put it.

1715
02:41:13,686 --> 02:41:23,570
"Would she not, in all honesty, have done
the same as Chuck and Vera and Ben and
Mrs. Henson and Tom"

1716
02:41:23,946 --> 02:41:26,907
and all these people in their houses?

1717
02:41:30,369 --> 02:41:32,829
Grace paused.

1718
02:41:33,205 --> 02:41:38,084
"And while she did, the clouds scattered
and let the moonlight through"

1719
02:41:45,633 --> 02:41:49,887
and Dogville underwent another
of little changes of light.

1720
02:42:03,150 --> 02:42:06,779
"It was as if the light, 
previously so merciful and faint,"

1721
02:42:06,779 --> 02:42:11,116
finally refused to cover up for the town any longer.

1722
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:17,205
"Suddenly you could no longer imagine a berry
that would appear one day on a gooseberry bush,"

1723
02:42:17,205 --> 02:42:20,584
but only see the thorn that was there right now.

1724
02:42:21,459 --> 02:42:28,758
The light now penetrated every unevenness
and flaw in the buildings... and in...the people!

1725
02:42:32,011 --> 02:42:36,974
And all of a sudden she knew the answer
to her question all too well:

1726
02:42:38,059 --> 02:42:44,231
"If she had acted like them, she could not have
defenced a single one of her actions"

1727
02:42:44,273 --> 02:42:47,276
and could not have condemned them
harshly enough.

1728
02:42:48,110 --> 02:42:54,032
It was as if her sorrow and pain finally
assumed their rightful place.

1729
02:42:54,283 --> 02:42:59,287
"No, what they had done was
not good enough."

1730
02:42:59,704 --> 02:43:04,209
"And if one had the power to put it to rights,
it was one's duty to do so,"

1731
02:43:04,250 --> 02:43:08,713
"for the sake of the other towns,
for the sake of humanity,"

1732
02:43:09,672 --> 02:43:15,720
"and not least, for the sake of the human being
that was Grace herself."

1733
02:43:24,186 --> 02:43:30,484
"If I went back and became your daughter again,"

1734
02:43:30,984 --> 02:43:33,737
when would I be given the power
you're talking about?

1735
02:43:38,241 --> 02:43:40,786
- Now?
- At once!

1736
02:43:41,077 --> 02:43:42,120
Why not?

1737
02:43:48,251 --> 02:43:54,173
So that would mean that I'd also take on
the immediate responsibilities at once.

1738
02:43:55,008 --> 02:43:57,593
I'd be a part in the problem solving...

1739
02:43:59,095 --> 02:44:02,598
like the problem.. of Dogville.

1740
02:44:08,479 --> 02:44:13,442
We can start by shooting a dog
and nailing it to a wall.

1741
02:44:13,567 --> 02:44:20,490
"Over there beneath that lamp, for example.
Well, it might help. It sometimes does."

1742
02:44:20,782 --> 02:44:26,871
"It would only make the town more frightened,
but hardly make it a better place."

1743
02:44:29,082 --> 02:44:30,750
And it could happen again.

1744
02:44:31,626 --> 02:44:43,638
"Somebody happening by,
revealing their frailty."

1745
02:44:47,933 --> 02:44:51,228
"That's what I wanna use the power for,
if you don't mind."

1746
02:44:54,940 --> 02:44:59,069
I wanna make this world a little better.

1747
02:45:03,532 --> 02:45:07,160
"That damn kid won't shup up.
Says he wants to talk to you, Miss."

1748
02:45:07,494 --> 02:45:09,371
Can we just shoot him now?

1749
02:45:11,039 --> 02:45:12,874
Let me talk to him.

1750
02:45:17,462 --> 02:45:19,505
What? What is it?

1751
02:45:21,966 --> 02:45:26,262
"A man can't really be blamed
for being scared now, can he?"

1752
02:45:26,595 --> 02:45:28,556
- No. That's true.
- No!

1753
02:45:29,140 --> 02:45:31,016
"I'm scared, Grace."

1754
02:45:31,267 --> 02:45:34,144
I used you. And I'm sorry.

1755
02:45:34,228 --> 02:45:38,732
"I am stupid, I am.
Maybe even arrogant sometimes."

1756
02:45:40,984 --> 02:45:42,444
"You are, Tom."

1757
02:45:44,988 --> 02:45:49,367
"Although using people is not very charming,
I think you have to agree"

1758
02:45:49,451 --> 02:45:54,289
that this specific illustration
has surpassed all expectations.

1759
02:45:54,330 --> 02:45:56,416
It says so much about being human.

1760
02:45:56,749 --> 02:46:01,337
"It's been painful, but I think you also have to
agree it has been edifying. Wouldn't you say?"

1761
02:46:01,462 --> 02:46:05,341
"Not now, Tom.
Not now."

1762
02:46:09,637 --> 02:46:13,766
"If there is any town in this world
would be better without, this is it."

1763
02:46:20,189 --> 02:46:22,274
Shoot them and burn down the town.

1764
02:46:26,862 --> 02:46:29,865
"What?
Something else, honey?"

1765
02:46:30,824 --> 02:46:33,201
There is a family with kids...

1766
02:46:36,037 --> 02:46:39,123
do the kids first and make the mother watch.

1767
02:46:39,541 --> 02:46:43,503
Tell her you will stop if she can
hold back her tears.

1768
02:46:47,507 --> 02:46:49,592
I owe her that.

1769
02:46:56,098 --> 02:46:59,268
I'm afraid she cries a little too easily.

1770
02:47:01,603 --> 02:47:04,314
We'd better get you out of here.

1771
02:47:05,691 --> 02:47:08,777
"I'm afraid, you've learned
far too much already."

1772
02:47:15,158 --> 02:47:18,870
"Are you cold, Sweetie.
Do you need a wrap?"

1773
02:47:19,662 --> 02:47:20,872
I'm fine.

1774
02:47:24,125 --> 02:47:27,462
You want the curtains opened?
You don't need them anymore.

1775
02:47:27,920 --> 02:47:29,505
What do you think?

1776
02:47:35,553 --> 02:47:41,517
I think we should open them.
I think it's appropriate.

1777
02:49:38,796 --> 02:49:40,298
"Bingo, Grace!"

1778
02:49:42,967 --> 02:49:43,884
Bingo!

1779
02:49:46,303 --> 02:49:50,099
"I have to tell you, your illustration
beat the hell out of mine."

1780
02:49:52,476 --> 02:49:57,230
"It's frightening, yes, but so clear."

1781
02:49:58,607 --> 02:50:04,279
Do you think that I can allow myself
to use it as an inspiration in my writing?

1782
02:50:13,579 --> 02:50:15,039
Goodbye Tom.

1783
02:50:41,940 --> 02:50:46,820
- Somethings you have to do yourself.
- Really

1784
02:50:50,365 --> 02:50:53,368
That one you're gonna have to explain
to me on the way home.

1785
02:50:54,953 --> 02:50:56,829
[Narrator] Suddenly there was a noise.

1786
02:50:56,954 --> 02:51:01,834
"Not so persuasive and powerful
as it had been on a rainy night in spring,"

1787
02:51:01,959 --> 02:51:07,965
but loud enough to work its way through
the final sighs of the timber that was rapidly burning out.

1788
02:51:09,091 --> 02:51:12,344
It came again.
Everyone heard it.

1789
02:51:12,469 --> 02:51:14,555
Grace was the first to recognize it.

1790
02:51:14,596 --> 02:51:15,973
"That's Moses,"

1791
02:51:16,306 --> 02:51:19,393
"That's Moses, she said,
and jumped out of the car."

1792
02:51:20,185 --> 02:51:27,234
"She quickly covered the distance to the dog pen
over what, now the buildings were gone,
could scarcely be 
called a street,"

1793
02:51:27,275 --> 02:51:32,405
"and certainly not Elm Street as there wasn't
a tree left on Dogville's little mountain ledge,"

1794
02:51:32,489 --> 02:51:34,157
let alone an elm.

1795
02:51:34,491 --> 02:51:36,367
It was Moses.

1796
02:51:36,409 --> 02:51:39,829
His survival was astonishing.
A miracle.

1797
02:51:41,080 --> 02:51:44,333
"No, just let him be."

1798
02:51:45,001 --> 02:51:48,129
They will have spotted the flames
in Georgetown by now.

1799
02:51:49,004 --> 02:51:51,257
Some one'll come and find him.

1800
02:51:56,261 --> 02:51:59,765
He's just angry
because I once took his bone.

1801
02:52:10,400 --> 02:52:16,823
"Whether Grace left Dogville or on the contrary,
Dogville had left her (and the world in general)"

1802
02:52:16,865 --> 02:52:22,161
is a question of a more artful nature
that few would benefit from by asking

1803
02:52:22,286 --> 02:52:25,122
and even fewer by providing an answer.

1804
02:52:25,206 --> 02:52:28,501
And nor indeed will it be answered here!
