

2
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:39,273
Fanny.

3
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:44,211
Mother.

4
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:02,697
Siri.

5
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:08,602
Maj.

6
00:02:55,022 --> 00:02:56,284
Grandma.

7
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:02,647
Alexander.

8
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:05,144
How are things?

9
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:14,989
Would you like to play cards
before dinner?

10
00:06:21,662 --> 00:06:25,359
This is the 43rd Christmas
we're celebrating together.

11
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:27,366
My dear Ester, is it possible?

12
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:30,198
Yes, the 43rd.

13
00:06:30,304 --> 00:06:32,465
Well, well, who'd have thought it?

14
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,035
Yes, it's odd.

15
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,973
Dear Ester.

16
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:04,594
Good evening, Mrs. Ekdahl.

17
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:06,366
Good evening, girls.

18
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:32,329
- Alida, you may join the other girls.
- Thank you, Mrs. Ekdahl.

19
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:37,268
- Why are you so sullen?
- I'm not sullen.

20
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:38,895
I can see you are.

21
00:07:39,006 --> 00:07:40,871
You're always sullen
on Christmas Eve.

22
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:44,671
- I don't know what you mean.
- You heard me. You're sullen.

23
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:50,345
Old hag.

24
00:09:14,635 --> 00:09:17,604
Worthy Joseph, do not fear

25
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:21,239
Thy angel is thee ever near

26
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:25,570
I come in haste to bring thee word

27
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,876
From thy creator and thy God

28
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,014
Mary and the child now wake

29
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:36,151
And quickly into safety take

30
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:39,584
Herod with his murdering hand

31
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,261
Threatens every man-child in this land

32
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:48,763
All this I have noted well

33
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:52,430
And shall do as you foretell

34
00:09:52,806 --> 00:09:55,798
Praised be God upon his throne

35
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:59,570
Who thus protects my only son

36
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,628
Thus, good people, ends our play

37
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,999
It all ends well this holy day

38
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:25,734
The son of God, saved from the sword

39
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:28,737
Is our savior, Christ the Lord

40
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:32,104
We know that in his mercy mild

41
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:38,408
He guards every woman, man and child

42
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:41,612
A time of joyous Christmas cheer

43
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:44,881
We wish to all, both far and near

44
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:48,052
Let no one into darkness fall

45
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:53,030
A Merry Christmas one and all

46
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:44,007
Traditionally the Ekdahls give a party
for the theater staff down on the stage.

47
00:11:45,152 --> 00:11:48,019
The guests are what you'd call
a rather mixed lot.

48
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:51,579
Quite different from what we're used to
here in the theater restaurant.

49
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:54,961
Nevertheless, I don't want to see
any supercilious glances,

50
00:11:55,062 --> 00:11:57,997
snootiness, or raised eyebrows.

51
00:11:58,298 --> 00:12:03,998
I want to see generosity,
warmth and kindness. Is that clear?

52
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:05,731
- Yes, sir.
- That's the spirit!

53
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,636
Alma and Petra,
take the Christmas basket.

54
00:12:07,741 --> 00:12:09,231
I'll take the punch bowl.

55
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:15,906
- Are we ready?
- Yes, sir.

56
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,408
Forward march!

57
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:06,893
Come along, Carlchen.

58
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,299
We mustn't be late
to your mother's like last year.

59
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:15,833
Come along.

60
00:13:16,176 --> 00:13:17,837
Hurry up.

61
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:58,011
Merry Christmas!

62
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:04,189
Merry Christmas, Oscar.

63
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:11,497
Help yourselves, everybody!

64
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:16,535
Step forward, step forward.
Don't be shy.

65
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:20,262
My dear friends.

66
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:24,807
For 22 years...

67
00:14:25,846 --> 00:14:30,215
in the capacity of theater manager,

68
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:33,753
I've stood here and made a speech...

69
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:39,782
without really having any talent...

70
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:45,724
for that sort of thing.

71
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:52,200
Especially if you think of my father,

72
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:57,538
who was brilliant at speeches.

73
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:09,851
My only talent,
if you can call it that in my case...

74
00:15:10,891 --> 00:15:14,827
is that I love this little world...

75
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:19,523
inside the thick walls
of this playhouse.

76
00:15:21,668 --> 00:15:26,401
And I'm fond of the people
who work in this little world.

77
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:36,342
Outside is the big world,

78
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:39,111
and sometimes
the little world succeeds...

79
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:44,115
in reflecting the big one...

80
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,993
so that we understand it better.

81
00:15:52,766 --> 00:15:56,725
Or perhaps we give the people
who come here

82
00:15:57,704 --> 00:16:03,665
a chance to forget for a while...

83
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:07,475
for a few short moments...

84
00:16:14,754 --> 00:16:16,915
for a few short moments...

85
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:23,422
the harsh world outside.

86
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:32,135
Our theater is...

87
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:37,806
a little room...

88
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,907
of orderliness, routine, care...

89
00:16:44,985 --> 00:16:46,509
and love.

90
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:52,884
I don't know why I feel...

91
00:16:56,129 --> 00:17:01,123
so comically solemn... this evening.

92
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,330
When you've given Ismael his dinner,

93
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:10,572
turn off the lights in the shop
and lock up.

94
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:14,936
I have the key.

95
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,085
Good night, Aron.

96
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:27,216
Good night, Uncle Isak.

97
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:23,210
Isak!

98
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,053
Merry Christmas.

99
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:49,468
I can't think where they all are.

100
00:18:49,843 --> 00:18:52,175
They should have been here
a long time ago.

101
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:57,314
I expect Oscar is making
a long, dull speech.

102
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:59,180
I think I hear them
down in the street.

103
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:01,651
Ester, bring me my fur.

104
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:27,779
There comes my family.

105
00:19:45,698 --> 00:19:46,858
Merry Christmas.

106
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:48,957
Merry Christmas, Grandma.

107
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:51,737
Merry Christmas, Aunt.

108
00:19:53,406 --> 00:19:56,842
Mama, you look so beautiful.

109
00:20:51,164 --> 00:20:52,597
What is it, darling?

110
00:20:57,437 --> 00:21:00,463
Aunt Emma, how nice to see you.

111
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:05,604
Aunt Emma, how nice. Welcome.

112
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:11,039
What time is it?

113
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:21,251
The only question is:
Where are Carl and Lydia?

114
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:23,459
Perhaps they got the wrong time.

115
00:21:23,563 --> 00:21:27,499
Christmas dinner is always at 4:30.

116
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,970
Alexander, run down
and ring Uncle Carl's doorbell.

117
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:43,009
- Carlchen, please hurry.
- Shut up!

118
00:21:43,116 --> 00:21:44,481
- We're so late.
- Shut up!

119
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:46,848
We arrive late every year.

120
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:52,788
- I'm doing this for your sake.
- No more, <i>mein Carlchen.</i>

121
00:21:58,865 --> 00:22:01,663
- Mama.
- Well, Carl.

122
00:22:02,335 --> 00:22:03,859
Merry Christmas, Aunt.

123
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:07,401
Well, at last we can have dinner.

124
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:31,656
<i>Now for the first</i>
<i>Sing hop faderallan lallan lay</i>

125
00:22:31,764 --> 00:22:35,530
<i>And those who don't the first one take</i>
<i>will also number two forsake</i>

126
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:39,033
<i>Now for the first</i>

127
00:22:42,642 --> 00:22:46,840
<i>Sing hop faderallan lallan lay</i>

128
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:52,617
<i>Now it's Yule again, now it's Yule again</i>
<i>and Yule will last until it's Easter</i>

129
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:54,648
<i>That's not true of course</i>
<i>No, that's not true of course</i>

130
00:22:54,754 --> 00:22:56,881
<i>For in between comes</i>
<i>Lent and fasting</i>

131
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:45,396
What would Maj say to a little visit
in her room this evening?

132
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:47,769
The master must be joking.

133
00:24:02,555 --> 00:24:04,182
Are you all right, sir?

134
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:07,257
I'm fine.

135
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,384
I must help the girls with the tree.

136
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:43,785
Have you noticed that my old man
has begun to court Maj?

137
00:24:59,545 --> 00:25:01,638
- Aren't you angry?
- Angry?

138
00:25:01,747 --> 00:25:03,681
I think it's sweet.

139
00:25:17,096 --> 00:25:18,563
Children, come.

140
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:26,503
Uncle Carl is going to treat you
to one helluva fireworks show.

141
00:26:01,741 --> 00:26:03,299
Stay here.

142
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,303
Ready?

143
00:26:49,655 --> 00:26:51,020
Number one.

144
00:26:55,061 --> 00:26:56,494
Now comes number two.

145
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,728
Now comes number three.

146
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,605
Bring the candle.

147
00:27:23,222 --> 00:27:25,713
"And it came to pass in those days

148
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:29,193
that there went out a decree
from Caesar Augustus

149
00:27:29,295 --> 00:27:32,890
that all the world should be taxed.

150
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,198
And this taxing was first made

151
00:27:37,303 --> 00:27:41,262
when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.

152
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:48,572
And all went to be taxed,
every one into his own city.

153
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:52,977
And Joseph also went up from Galilee

154
00:27:53,552 --> 00:27:57,955
out of the city of Nazareth,
into Judea...

155
00:27:59,425 --> 00:28:02,690
unto the city of David,
which is called Bethlehem...

156
00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:07,096
because he was of the house
and lineage of David,

157
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:13,269
to be taxed with Mary his wife,

158
00:28:13,606 --> 00:28:15,301
who was great with child."

159
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:42,997
- Give up?
- No!

160
00:29:12,665 --> 00:29:15,190
I'm sorry.
It's a terrible mess in here.

161
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:21,768
Come see us later
and you'll get a Christmas present.

162
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:25,036
Thank you, Mrs. Ekdahl.

163
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,774
Now then, children, into bed.

164
00:29:35,755 --> 00:29:37,723
Hurry up, Alexander.

165
00:29:38,257 --> 00:29:39,918
To bed now, children.

166
00:30:08,087 --> 00:30:10,021
Now say your prayers.

167
00:30:10,122 --> 00:30:13,523
Thank you God for this day.
Please make me good.

168
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:15,594
May your angel stay by me
through the night.

169
00:30:15,694 --> 00:30:18,424
God bless Papa and Mama,
Grandpapa and Grandmama,

170
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:22,126
myself and my brothers and sisters
and cousins, uncles and aunts,

171
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:27,729
Vega, Ester, Maj, Siri, Berta, Alida, Lisen
and Uncle Isak and everybody else.

172
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,932
Amen.

173
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:32,033
- Good night, Alexander.
- Good night, sweetheart.

174
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:39,313
Good night. Sleep well.

175
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,620
Putte kisses like a real man.

176
00:31:17,356 --> 00:31:19,688
Look at my Christmas present.

177
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:26,061
Look what Mrs. Ekdahl gave me.

178
00:31:27,533 --> 00:31:30,934
Aren't I beautiful?
Don't I look lovely?

179
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,133
I look like a real lady.

180
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,773
Don't you think?

181
00:31:39,044 --> 00:31:42,673
Tonight you can't sleep in Maj's bed
because Maj will have a visitor.

182
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:49,815
And I can't just have
any number of men in my bed.

183
00:31:54,026 --> 00:31:57,689
But you're Maj's sweetheart.
You know that.

184
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:58,950
Well, my dear ones,
it's time to say good night.

185
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:00,685
We're getting up early.

186
00:33:06,131 --> 00:33:09,726
Carlchen! Wake up.

187
00:33:09,935 --> 00:33:11,527
We're going home.

188
00:33:15,174 --> 00:33:18,701
Good night, Mama.
Carl's a bit tired. I'll give him a hand.

189
00:33:19,144 --> 00:33:21,237
Come along now.
We're going home.

190
00:33:29,621 --> 00:33:31,680
Good night.

191
00:33:33,225 --> 00:33:34,590
Good night, Mama.

192
00:33:44,737 --> 00:33:49,071
- I stayed behind.
- So I noticed.

193
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:45,828
There she lies, the beautiful girl,
poor Arabella.

194
00:34:47,466 --> 00:34:49,730
Little does she know what awaits her.

195
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:54,999
She's alone in the whole house.

196
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:03,038
Her mother is dead, and her father
is carousing with loose companions.

197
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:08,513
Who comes there as the clock
strikes 12:00 in the castle tower?

198
00:35:08,821 --> 00:35:10,220
"Fear seizes me.

199
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,784
What is that terrifying white figure

200
00:35:17,162 --> 00:35:21,724
floating on the moonbeams
and drawing near my bed?

201
00:35:25,304 --> 00:35:28,933
It is my dead mother.
My mother's ghost."

202
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:38,545
No more noise in here now!

203
00:35:39,718 --> 00:35:42,482
Go to sleep, children.
Good night.

204
00:35:48,026 --> 00:35:50,426
I thought I smelled
kerosene in the nursery.

205
00:35:50,529 --> 00:35:53,259
- Kerosene?
- Yes, kerosene.

206
00:35:55,467 --> 00:35:57,731
There's no kerosene lamp
in the nursery.

207
00:35:57,836 --> 00:35:59,497
Well, it smells like it anyway.

208
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:07,307
Here we go, Isak.
I've made some nice strong coffee.

209
00:36:07,813 --> 00:36:10,441
Much better than Vega's
awful dishwater.

210
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:13,212
Give this a try.

211
00:36:14,553 --> 00:36:17,784
What can the time be?
Ten past 3:00.

212
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,188
We can sit for two hours,

213
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:22,958
and then I must change
for early service.

214
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,898
How good it is to have you here!

215
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:31,928
You're my best friend.

216
00:36:32,905 --> 00:36:35,305
Whatever would I do without you?

217
00:36:46,785 --> 00:36:49,583
Last year I enjoyed Christmas.

218
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:52,751
This year all I wanted to do was cry.

219
00:36:56,094 --> 00:36:58,392
I suppose I'm getting old.

220
00:36:59,765 --> 00:37:01,596
Do you think I've aged?

221
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,395
You've grown older, yes.

222
00:37:04,136 --> 00:37:06,161
I thought so.

223
00:37:09,308 --> 00:37:11,936
Yes, I just wanted to cry.

224
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:15,812
Though I love having
the grandchildren, of course.

225
00:37:18,016 --> 00:37:20,177
I didn't think Oscar looked well.

226
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:23,448
He wears himself out
with that theater.

227
00:37:23,555 --> 00:37:27,286
And the idea of him playing
the ghost.

228
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:29,189
He should take it easy.

229
00:37:29,294 --> 00:37:32,752
Besides, he's an awfully bad actor.

230
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:41,396
I wonder if Emilie realizes
that he's weak and needs rest.

231
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:45,842
I think I'll have a word with her.

232
00:37:49,581 --> 00:37:53,711
He's capable, of course.
Capable and conscientious.

233
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:58,586
Can you believe the theater
even makes a small profit?

234
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,123
Isn't that splendid?

235
00:38:00,225 --> 00:38:04,161
A few years ago I contributed
a minimum of 50,000 kronor per year.

236
00:38:04,496 --> 00:38:08,193
I didn't care, but Oscar felt
so awkward asking me for money.

237
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:11,664
Not like Carl.

238
00:38:13,405 --> 00:38:16,238
He asked me for a new loan,
but I refused.

239
00:38:18,877 --> 00:38:21,846
If he comes to you for money,
you must say no too.

240
00:38:21,947 --> 00:38:23,972
Promise me that.
- Yes, yes.

241
00:38:24,082 --> 00:38:26,016
I don't understand it.

242
00:38:26,118 --> 00:38:29,315
Time and again
I clear everything up for him.

243
00:38:29,421 --> 00:38:31,821
After a year, he's in dire straits again.

244
00:38:35,027 --> 00:38:39,487
He says he doesn't go to moneylenders.

245
00:38:40,332 --> 00:38:41,924
Do you know?
- No.

246
00:38:42,601 --> 00:38:45,661
And that poor German woman
he's married to.

247
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:48,331
How could he have fallen for her?

248
00:38:49,341 --> 00:38:52,174
It must be something erotic.

249
00:38:53,045 --> 00:38:54,637
What do you think?

250
00:38:54,746 --> 00:38:58,011
Erotic? Yes, perhaps.

251
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:00,346
- You're not listening.
- Yes, I am.

252
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:04,718
Never mind. The main thing is
that you keep me company.

253
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:16,493
Carl and Gustav Adolf are oversexed.

254
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:19,627
They take after their father.
He was oversexed.

255
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:23,836
At times I thought
it was too much of a good thing,

256
00:39:24,076 --> 00:39:25,634
but I never refused.

257
00:39:26,845 --> 00:39:28,745
Gustav Adolf is incorrigible.

258
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:33,206
I've spoken with Alma, and she wisely says
she doesn't mind his philandering,

259
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:37,482
because he's the kindest husband
in the world.

260
00:39:38,256 --> 00:39:41,384
It's fortunate that Alma
is so understanding.

261
00:39:44,396 --> 00:39:49,026
Perhaps I ought to warn that nursemaid Maj,
or whatever her name is.

262
00:39:51,236 --> 00:39:54,228
I must say she's very pretty,
and good with the children.

263
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:57,233
Beautiful coloring and a nice figure.

264
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:01,143
Pity she limps, the poor thing.

265
00:40:03,482 --> 00:40:06,178
Are you sad
because you've grown old?

266
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:10,955
I'm certainly not.
Everything's getting worse.

267
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:15,782
Worse people,
worse machines, worse wars...

268
00:40:16,528 --> 00:40:17,961
and worse weather.

269
00:40:18,063 --> 00:40:19,724
I'm glad I'll soon be dead.

270
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:24,825
You're an incorrigible old misanthrope
and always have been.

271
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:28,804
I don't agree with you.
- I thought as much.

272
00:40:28,907 --> 00:40:32,365
That doesn't stop me from crying.

273
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:37,212
Would you mind if I cry a while?

274
00:40:51,663 --> 00:40:55,565
No, upon my soul, I can't.
The tears won't come.

275
00:40:56,568 --> 00:40:58,763
I'll have to have some more cognac.

276
00:41:11,216 --> 00:41:13,946
What are you laughing at?

277
00:41:14,052 --> 00:41:19,490
Do you remember when we sat there
on the sofa kissing madly?

278
00:41:19,925 --> 00:41:21,688
You had unbuttoned my blouse,

279
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:24,728
and something else too.

280
00:41:24,963 --> 00:41:27,488
Then suddenly the curtain
was drawn aside,

281
00:41:27,699 --> 00:41:30,600
and there stood my dear husband.

282
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,866
It was just like a play by Feydeau.

283
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:40,042
I screamed and you made for the door.

284
00:41:40,445 --> 00:41:46,350
He rushed off to get his pistol,
with me hanging on his leg.

285
00:41:47,986 --> 00:41:52,423
You became friends for life.

286
00:41:52,524 --> 00:41:54,958
Your husband was a greathearted man.

287
00:41:59,364 --> 00:42:01,628
Now I'm weeping.

288
00:42:03,001 --> 00:42:05,970
The happy, splendid life is over,

289
00:42:06,605 --> 00:42:11,838
and the horrible,
dirty life engulfs us.

290
00:42:12,611 --> 00:42:15,409
That's the way it is.

291
00:42:23,955 --> 00:42:27,914
This won't do.

292
00:42:28,026 --> 00:42:30,119
I must wash up
and redo my makeup,

293
00:42:31,796 --> 00:42:35,664
do my hair and put on
my corset and silk dress.

294
00:42:38,136 --> 00:42:43,369
A weepy, lovesick woman turns
into a self-possessed grandmother.

295
00:42:44,142 --> 00:42:46,474
We all play our parts.

296
00:42:46,578 --> 00:42:51,015
Some play them negligently,
others with great care.

297
00:42:51,116 --> 00:42:53,311
I'm one of the latter.

298
00:42:57,322 --> 00:42:59,187
Good night, my lovely Helen.

299
00:43:00,592 --> 00:43:03,117
You were a sweet lover.

300
00:43:03,695 --> 00:43:05,686
Like strawberries.

301
00:43:08,867 --> 00:43:11,893
You wanted me to help you
with your morning toilet, Mrs. Ekdahl.

302
00:43:12,404 --> 00:43:14,133
The time is ten to 5:00.

303
00:43:16,308 --> 00:43:20,369
A caf� on Castle Street.

304
00:43:21,313 --> 00:43:26,376
Your own cakes and pastries,

305
00:43:26,484 --> 00:43:29,510
tarts and confections.

306
00:43:33,258 --> 00:43:35,988
What do you say to that, little Maj?

307
00:43:37,462 --> 00:43:41,057
You'd be in charge of it.

308
00:43:43,435 --> 00:43:45,903
Just yesterday I said to Alma,

309
00:43:46,204 --> 00:43:50,231
"Look at Maj. She's a princess."

310
00:43:51,776 --> 00:43:54,336
What breasts you have, my girl.

311
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,409
Let me see properly.

312
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:00,108
You drive me crazy.

313
00:44:00,452 --> 00:44:02,750
Don't be afraid, child.

314
00:44:02,954 --> 00:44:06,253
I'm a wonderful lover.
All the women say so.

315
00:44:07,325 --> 00:44:10,817
Once you get me on my back,
you'll forget about the caf�.

316
00:44:10,929 --> 00:44:13,022
I swear.

317
00:44:13,198 --> 00:44:14,961
Give me something to write on.

318
00:44:15,266 --> 00:44:17,496
Come. Come over here.

319
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:21,761
Here's a pen.

320
00:44:24,643 --> 00:44:26,110
Now I'll write:

321
00:44:27,512 --> 00:44:29,480
"Maja Kling...

322
00:44:33,385 --> 00:44:37,287
is the proprietress of my caf�."

323
00:44:37,389 --> 00:44:41,018
Signed, Gustav Adolf Ekdahl.

324
00:44:44,629 --> 00:44:48,725
Christmas night, 1907.

325
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:53,134
There! That's a contract.

326
00:44:53,238 --> 00:44:57,197
Stick it under a lawyer's nose
if I forget my promise.

327
00:45:10,689 --> 00:45:13,681
Be careful not to put me
in the family way.

328
00:45:17,295 --> 00:45:21,493
Well, what do you say?
Aren't I nice?

329
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:24,658
Ever felt such a wooden leg?

330
00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:29,069
Damnation!
The rocket went off too soon.

331
00:45:33,545 --> 00:45:38,073
Oh, well, it happens.
Wasn't it wonderful?

332
00:45:39,984 --> 00:45:42,077
You're a real billy goat, sir.

333
00:45:42,721 --> 00:45:45,349
And you're my little lamb.

334
00:45:45,457 --> 00:45:49,860
I must lie on my back.
I'm all in a sweat.

335
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:53,658
I ate and drank too much.
- You're not ill?

336
00:45:53,765 --> 00:45:56,825
Not me!
I feel like a bakery ablaze.

337
00:45:57,135 --> 00:45:59,296
Or should I say caf�?

338
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,641
III? When I'm with
such a tasty little morsel?

339
00:46:05,744 --> 00:46:07,939
Sit on top of me.

340
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,210
Oh, you're impossible, sir!

341
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:18,920
<i>Ride a rocking horse to Banbury Cross</i>

342
00:46:19,023 --> 00:46:21,787
<i>To see a fine lady on a white steed</i>

343
00:46:21,893 --> 00:46:27,854
What a glorious time we're having!

344
00:46:43,081 --> 00:46:48,041
- My goodness, how your heart's pounding.
- I've got a splendid heart.

345
00:46:50,054 --> 00:46:51,749
Now you'll have to give me a new bed.

346
00:46:51,856 --> 00:46:55,417
You'll have a caf�,
an apartment,

347
00:46:55,527 --> 00:46:58,587
beautiful furniture, and a big bed.

348
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:02,263
- And pretty clothes.
- No one will be prettier.

349
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:05,302
You will be Gustav Adolf's mistress,

350
00:47:05,403 --> 00:47:09,203
and I'll come see you
every Wednesday and Saturday at 3:00.

351
00:47:11,876 --> 00:47:13,400
How silly you are.

352
00:47:13,511 --> 00:47:15,274
- What?
- I said you're silly.

353
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,611
- Silly, am I?
- You're a real numbskull.

354
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:23,949
I'm not a numbskull!

355
00:47:25,156 --> 00:47:28,057
You are, for imagining
I'd want anything from you.

356
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:29,922
Don't you want anything?

357
00:47:30,428 --> 00:47:32,555
Don't you see I was joking?

358
00:47:35,233 --> 00:47:36,632
Joking?

359
00:47:40,805 --> 00:47:42,238
In what way?

360
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,069
Don't be angry.

361
00:47:44,175 --> 00:47:48,373
I'm not, but I don't like
being treated like an idiot.

362
00:47:51,115 --> 00:47:54,846
Stop laughing.
- I think you're so funny.

363
00:48:04,562 --> 00:48:06,427
I can feel a cold coming on.

364
00:48:07,165 --> 00:48:09,030
My throat hurts when I swallow.

365
00:48:10,869 --> 00:48:12,632
My teeth are tingling.

366
00:48:16,674 --> 00:48:19,074
It's freezing in here.
Why isn't there any heat?

367
00:48:19,177 --> 00:48:22,840
We don't have any credit
with the wood merchant.

368
00:48:22,947 --> 00:48:26,246
We owe 150 kronor.
<i>Das wei�t Du doch.</i>

369
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:29,514
You haven't learned
a damn bit of Swedish in 23 years.

370
00:48:29,621 --> 00:48:31,350
Speak Swedish!

371
00:48:31,456 --> 00:48:33,356
I do my best.

372
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:37,258
Last Tuesday I asked Mama
for ten thousand to sort out my affairs.

373
00:48:38,263 --> 00:48:42,256
She took out a paper
that said I owed her 37,000.

374
00:48:43,268 --> 00:48:44,701
It's incredible.

375
00:48:45,036 --> 00:48:48,096
- You'll have to go to the Jew.
- I've already been.

376
00:48:48,773 --> 00:48:51,435
I'm paying one hell
of an exorbitant interest rate,

377
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:54,136
and if I don't pay on time,
he'll show the IOU to Mama.

378
00:48:55,046 --> 00:48:56,809
I have some jewelry.

379
00:48:57,649 --> 00:48:58,980
Idiot.

380
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:02,478
That would be nice. Professor Ekdahl
running to the pawnbroker.

381
00:49:04,222 --> 00:49:06,747
Aren't you coming to bed?

382
00:49:13,765 --> 00:49:17,292
Come, Carlchen.
Come and sit by me.

383
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:27,409
You smell bad.

384
00:49:28,546 --> 00:49:32,209
Have you given up washing,
or are you starting to rot?

385
00:49:33,685 --> 00:49:37,849
No. I don't smell bad at all.

386
00:49:39,157 --> 00:49:41,785
You have olfactory hallucinations.

387
00:49:56,274 --> 00:49:57,741
It's bleeding.

388
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:05,606
- Shall I bandage it up?
- No.

389
00:50:09,253 --> 00:50:13,053
- Won't you try and get some sleep?
- Yes.

390
00:50:15,126 --> 00:50:17,924
I feel sorry for you, <i>mein Carlchen.</i>

391
00:50:19,697 --> 00:50:22,097
How is it one becomes second-rate?

392
00:50:26,204 --> 00:50:28,138
Can you tell me that?

393
00:50:29,974 --> 00:50:31,839
How does the dust fall?

394
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:35,204
When has one lost?

395
00:50:37,015 --> 00:50:40,212
First I'm a prince,
heir to the kingdom.

396
00:50:45,523 --> 00:50:49,619
Suddenly, before I know it...

397
00:50:51,396 --> 00:50:53,091
I'm deposed.

398
00:50:56,267 --> 00:50:58,531
Death taps me on the shoulder.

399
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:03,231
The room is cold...

400
00:51:06,077 --> 00:51:08,307
and we can't pay for kindling.

401
00:51:16,587 --> 00:51:18,452
I'm stupid and unkind.

402
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:22,619
And I'm most unkind...

403
00:51:24,962 --> 00:51:27,260
to the only person who cares for me.

404
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,465
You can never forgive me.

405
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:34,130
I'm a shit and a cad.

406
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:39,940
If you'd like,
I'll make you a hot toddy.

407
00:51:40,044 --> 00:51:44,140
Don't be so damned servile!

408
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:48,441
Wipe your mouth.
Your lips are always wet. It's disgusting!

409
00:51:51,689 --> 00:51:54,021
I don't mean to be unkind.

410
00:51:57,662 --> 00:51:59,323
I know that, <i>mein Liebling.</i>

411
00:52:02,667 --> 00:52:04,862
Oh, life!

412
00:52:12,677 --> 00:52:17,580
Insomnia, poverty and humiliation.

413
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:24,312
Stretch out your hand
and you grope in the emptiness.

414
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:31,458
Why am I such a bloody coward?

415
00:52:48,646 --> 00:52:49,874
Good night.

416
00:53:20,645 --> 00:53:22,977
- Good morning, Papa.
- Good morning, Petra.

417
00:53:24,815 --> 00:53:26,646
Don't I get a kiss?

418
00:53:31,122 --> 00:53:33,613
- Good morning, Gustav Adolf.
- Good morning, Alma.

419
00:53:37,662 --> 00:53:39,653
Go and fry three eggs
and some ham for Papa,

420
00:53:39,764 --> 00:53:42,562
and make two cheese sandwiches.

421
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:45,297
What will you drink?
- Beer.

422
00:53:45,836 --> 00:53:49,772
Petra, you know
where the beer crate is.

423
00:53:50,408 --> 00:53:53,206
No, wait, I think there's some stout
in the cupboard.

424
00:53:54,745 --> 00:53:57,179
Would you rather have stout?
- Yes.

425
00:53:58,749 --> 00:54:02,549
Don't stand there staring.
We have to be at Grandma's in an hour.

426
00:54:09,527 --> 00:54:12,018
- How do you feel?
- Cognac.

427
00:54:14,031 --> 00:54:16,659
- I've put out your clothes.
- Thank you.

428
00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:20,435
And there's hot water
if you want a bath.

429
00:54:20,538 --> 00:54:22,130
That would be nice.

430
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:27,607
Hurry up now.

431
00:54:49,233 --> 00:54:52,634
You're a damned handsome woman.

432
00:54:53,037 --> 00:54:55,130
And you're a big shit.

433
00:55:03,981 --> 00:55:09,317
- Come to bed.
- I just did my hair.

434
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,686
We'll have a quick one standing up.

435
00:55:13,791 --> 00:55:18,125
- Petra's coming with breakfast.
- We'll lock the door.

436
00:55:19,063 --> 00:55:22,464
Come on then, but make it quick.

437
00:56:06,377 --> 00:56:09,505
- I don't think I can.
- You can't?

438
00:56:09,613 --> 00:56:12,081
No. There must be something wrong.

439
00:56:15,453 --> 00:56:18,854
- You're not sick, are you?
- I'm fit as a fiddle.

440
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:24,017
- Lie down on the bed.
- Yes, I guess I could do that.

441
00:56:30,134 --> 00:56:32,728
- Shall I bring in the breakfast tray?
- Yes, please.

442
00:56:34,338 --> 00:56:36,238
To think that I haven't killed you.

443
00:56:46,317 --> 00:56:48,114
Now what do you say?

444
00:57:15,212 --> 00:57:18,181
Well, my friends, it's time.

445
00:57:58,856 --> 00:58:04,294
<i>Sleeping within my orchard</i>
<i>my custom always of the afternoon</i>

446
00:58:05,262 --> 00:58:09,665
<i>upon my secure hour thy uncle stole</i>

447
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:14,263
<i>with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial</i>

448
00:58:14,538 --> 00:58:20,408
<i>and in the porches of my ears</i>
<i>did pour the leperous distilment,</i>

449
00:58:21,045 --> 00:58:26,779
<i>whose effect holds</i>
<i>such an enmity with blood of man</i>

450
00:58:26,884 --> 00:58:30,183
<i>that swift as quicksilver</i>
<i>it courses through</i>

451
00:58:30,287 --> 00:58:33,347
the natural gates and alleys
of the body

452
00:58:33,624 --> 00:58:37,287
and with a sudden vigor
it doth possess and curd,

453
00:58:37,394 --> 00:58:42,889
like eager droppings into milk,
the thin and wholesome blood:

454
00:58:43,834 --> 00:58:49,932
So did it mine and a most
instant tetter bark'd about

455
00:58:50,174 --> 00:58:55,339
most lazar-like,
with vile and loathsome crust

456
00:58:55,746 --> 00:58:58,112
all my smooth body.

457
00:58:58,983 --> 00:59:03,283
Oh, horrible, most horrible!

458
00:59:03,387 --> 00:59:06,618
If thou hast nature in thee,
bear it not.

459
00:59:06,957 --> 00:59:10,688
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be

460
00:59:10,794 --> 00:59:17,222
a couch for luxury and damned incest.

461
00:59:25,876 --> 00:59:28,242
I've forgotten what I am to do.

462
00:59:28,879 --> 00:59:31,143
You get up and exit upstage center.

463
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:56,101
- Where am I?
- Here... at the theater.

464
01:00:21,365 --> 01:00:23,390
Let's go home and rest.

465
01:00:28,606 --> 01:00:30,540
What's happened?

466
01:00:31,408 --> 01:00:33,171
You're tired, that's all.

467
01:00:33,711 --> 01:00:35,474
Shall I call for the ambulance?

468
01:00:40,684 --> 01:00:42,242
What am I doing here?

469
01:00:44,888 --> 01:00:46,583
You were acting.

470
01:00:49,326 --> 01:00:50,987
I was acting?

471
01:00:53,397 --> 01:00:55,422
Why was I acting?

472
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,000
Come along, Oscar.
Let's go home.

473
01:01:04,675 --> 01:01:06,302
Am I going to die now?

474
01:01:07,544 --> 01:01:09,444
Please help me.

475
01:01:11,982 --> 01:01:13,415
I'll get a carriage.

476
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,488
He needs his overcoat.

477
01:01:38,142 --> 01:01:40,372
Alexander, come along.

478
01:02:01,065 --> 01:02:02,498
Come on.

479
01:02:18,549 --> 01:02:19,914
Stop!

480
01:02:21,852 --> 01:02:24,753
I said stop! Hey, you!

481
01:02:29,593 --> 01:02:32,118
Take the cart behind you!

482
01:03:32,823 --> 01:03:34,085
No.

483
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:37,253
No.

484
01:03:38,896 --> 01:03:40,557
We know nothing yet.

485
01:03:42,232 --> 01:03:46,225
Yes, let's hope so.
Thank you for calling.

486
01:03:58,949 --> 01:04:02,544
- How is our dear Oscar?
- We can only hope.

487
01:04:32,583 --> 01:04:36,519
- How is he?
- It's a matter of hours.

488
01:04:36,954 --> 01:04:39,980
- Is he in pain?
- He sleeps most of the time.

489
01:04:54,805 --> 01:04:57,933
Go see Ester and Vega
for hot chocolate and sandwiches.

490
01:05:04,014 --> 01:05:05,811
Just imagine, children.

491
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:10,785
This letter will go all the way
to a mission in China.

492
01:05:11,955 --> 01:05:15,391
Mr. Albrektsson told me
his poodle had four puppies.

493
01:05:15,492 --> 01:05:20,054
A friend of mine
has lived there for 50 years.

494
01:05:22,532 --> 01:05:26,366
He wondered
if you'd like a puppy.

495
01:05:26,937 --> 01:05:29,337
Mama won't let us
have dogs or cats.

496
01:05:29,439 --> 01:05:31,703
- We could keep it here.
- Really?

497
01:05:31,808 --> 01:05:33,275
- Yes.
- Splendid.

498
01:05:33,377 --> 01:05:35,345
Otherwise it'll be sold.

499
01:05:35,445 --> 01:05:40,178
When I was in China,
working in the fields with my friend,

500
01:05:40,417 --> 01:05:43,477
we had a dog and three cats.

501
01:05:45,856 --> 01:05:49,314
- Want to play again?
- You take red, then.

502
01:05:51,161 --> 01:05:55,063
Mr. Albrektsson
makes lots of money on his dogs,

503
01:05:55,165 --> 01:05:57,156
but he wants to give this puppy away.

504
01:05:57,267 --> 01:05:58,962
He's wealthy in his own right.

505
01:05:59,069 --> 01:06:02,903
It's his wife's money, dear Ester.

506
01:06:09,212 --> 01:06:12,648
Would you two like
a molasses sandwich?

507
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,343
Yes, please, Miss Vega.

508
01:06:17,821 --> 01:06:20,187
There, the letter's finished.

509
01:06:20,624 --> 01:06:23,092
Come, Fanny,
and I'll let you lick the envelope.

510
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:32,364
- Would you like to borrow the flute?
- No, thank you.

511
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:36,870
- You want to lick the stamp?
- No, thank you.

512
01:06:37,808 --> 01:06:40,038
You lick the stamp, then.

513
01:06:45,048 --> 01:06:46,811
Thank you, sweetheart.

514
01:06:50,253 --> 01:06:51,720
Leave me alone.

515
01:07:07,537 --> 01:07:08,834
Come in.

516
01:07:19,349 --> 01:07:21,283
Your mama asked me to come get you.

517
01:07:22,652 --> 01:07:24,552
Let's put down the sandwiches.

518
01:08:32,789 --> 01:08:35,053
Come, Alexander.
Don't be afraid.

519
01:08:42,432 --> 01:08:44,161
Come here, Alexander.

520
01:08:48,805 --> 01:08:50,272
Come on.

521
01:09:24,074 --> 01:09:25,837
I'll wait outside.

522
01:09:29,946 --> 01:09:31,311
Come here, Fanny.

523
01:09:47,197 --> 01:09:50,325
Tell Alexander
there's nothing to be afraid of.

524
01:09:50,433 --> 01:09:52,526
I'll tell him.

525
01:10:10,053 --> 01:10:14,990
I could play the ghost now...

526
01:10:17,594 --> 01:10:18,993
really well.

527
01:10:25,769 --> 01:10:26,895
Nothing.

528
01:10:28,838 --> 01:10:30,465
Nothing...

529
01:10:32,409 --> 01:10:34,343
separates me from all of you.

530
01:10:34,945 --> 01:10:36,435
Not now...

531
01:10:37,547 --> 01:10:39,208
and not later.

532
01:10:42,485 --> 01:10:43,952
I know that.

533
01:10:49,259 --> 01:10:50,726
I see it...

534
01:10:53,296 --> 01:10:55,958
quite clearly.

535
01:10:57,367 --> 01:11:00,268
I'll be closer to you now...

536
01:11:02,739 --> 01:11:04,297
than when I lived.

537
01:11:10,113 --> 01:11:12,377
Now I'd like to look at Alexander.

538
01:11:25,729 --> 01:11:28,459
Father says there's nothing
to be afraid of.

539
01:11:39,042 --> 01:11:41,067
Don't be childish now.

540
01:11:41,344 --> 01:11:44,404
Try to be a good boy.

541
01:13:56,546 --> 01:13:58,844
Fanny, wake up.
You hear that?

542
01:16:47,717 --> 01:16:50,811
Cock, piss, shit, fart,

543
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:53,821
piss, hell, shit,

544
01:16:53,923 --> 01:16:57,154
cock, fart, shit, piss,

545
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:01,219
fart, cock, cunt, damn, hell,

546
01:17:01,331 --> 01:17:05,529
crap, ass, piss, cock, butt, pussy.

547
01:17:52,248 --> 01:17:55,547
Siri, tell the children
they may leave the table.

548
01:17:55,652 --> 01:17:57,017
Yes, ma'am.

549
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,701
Did you hear something?

550
01:19:10,793 --> 01:19:12,658
Alexander, wake up!

551
01:19:13,329 --> 01:19:14,887
There's something out there.

552
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:34,642
Good day, Alexander.

553
01:20:34,911 --> 01:20:36,902
Please give my regards
to your mother.

554
01:20:59,235 --> 01:21:00,361
Hi.

555
01:21:15,051 --> 01:21:16,518
What's wrong?

556
01:21:40,142 --> 01:21:42,007
Someone wishes to talk to you.

557
01:21:42,111 --> 01:21:43,976
The hot chocolate will have to wait.

558
01:21:52,088 --> 01:21:54,181
- What have I done?
- You know quite well.

559
01:22:08,371 --> 01:22:10,271
- Good day, Alexander.
- Good day.

560
01:22:11,774 --> 01:22:13,799
We met once before.

561
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:16,970
Under sadder circumstances,
when I officiated at your father's funeral.

562
01:22:18,714 --> 01:22:23,344
Since then, your mother has turned to me
with her worries, as is only natural.

563
01:22:24,687 --> 01:22:27,520
I am a close friend
of your grandmother.

564
01:22:28,591 --> 01:22:30,718
I'm the spiritual guide of the parish.

565
01:22:30,826 --> 01:22:35,092
The bishop has been very good to me
during this difficult time.

566
01:22:35,197 --> 01:22:38,394
We've also spoken of you, my son.

567
01:22:38,501 --> 01:22:41,698
I've told the bishop how proud I am
of my well-behaved children.

568
01:22:41,938 --> 01:22:44,566
You and your sister
are doing well at school, I'm told.

569
01:22:44,674 --> 01:22:47,199
Diligent and attentive,
and earning good grades.

570
01:22:47,443 --> 01:22:49,502
Isn't that so, Alexander?

571
01:22:49,946 --> 01:22:53,040
Don't be afraid.
I'm your friend and wish you well.

572
01:22:53,749 --> 01:22:55,307
You believe me, don't you?

573
01:22:56,986 --> 01:23:00,854
But diligence and good grades
are not everything in this world.

574
01:23:00,957 --> 01:23:02,549
Blow your nose, Alexander.

575
01:23:08,097 --> 01:23:11,965
That's filthy!
Didn't Maj give you a clean handkerchief?

576
01:23:12,335 --> 01:23:13,427
Yes.

577
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,901
Goddamn it all!

578
01:23:19,141 --> 01:23:23,009
As I said, diligence and good grades
aren't everything in this world.

579
01:23:23,112 --> 01:23:25,239
Listen to the bishop, Alexander.

580
01:23:25,348 --> 01:23:26,940
I'm sure he is.

581
01:23:28,317 --> 01:23:29,750
Isn't that so, Alexander?

582
01:23:30,152 --> 01:23:32,620
You're anxious to know
what I'm going to say.

583
01:23:34,290 --> 01:23:36,087
You're a big boy now.

584
01:23:36,192 --> 01:23:39,753
So I'll talk to you man to man.

585
01:23:42,531 --> 01:23:44,226
Can you tell me -

586
01:23:44,767 --> 01:23:48,225
Can you explain to me

587
01:23:48,971 --> 01:23:50,802
what a lie is

588
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,369
and what the truth is?

589
01:23:58,447 --> 01:24:01,245
You think that was a stupid question,
and it probably was.

590
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:03,284
I was just kidding with you.

591
01:24:03,386 --> 01:24:06,787
Of course you know what a lie is
and what the truth is, don't you?

592
01:24:08,391 --> 01:24:09,585
Splendid.

593
01:24:11,127 --> 01:24:12,526
Splendid, my boy.

594
01:24:14,463 --> 01:24:17,955
You also know why one lies.

595
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:22,662
Why does one lie?

596
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:27,566
Why does one lie?

597
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:31,346
Can you explain to me why one lies?

598
01:24:33,182 --> 01:24:35,082
Because you don't
want to tell the truth.

599
01:24:39,789 --> 01:24:42,189
A very sly answer, my young friend.

600
01:24:43,592 --> 01:24:46,390
But you won't get off so easily.

601
01:24:46,629 --> 01:24:48,859
I asked you...

602
01:24:52,101 --> 01:24:54,365
why does one not tell the truth?

603
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:56,337
I don't know.

604
01:24:58,507 --> 01:25:00,407
We have plenty of time, Alexander,

605
01:25:00,509 --> 01:25:02,602
and I'm so interested in your answer

606
01:25:02,711 --> 01:25:04,702
that I'm prepared to wait indefinitely.

607
01:25:06,382 --> 01:25:09,317
You may not believe that,
but it's true.

608
01:25:11,187 --> 01:25:13,121
One lies to gain an advantage.

609
01:25:13,622 --> 01:25:16,113
Good answer, my boy.

610
01:25:16,892 --> 01:25:18,757
Good and concise.

611
01:25:20,396 --> 01:25:24,230
Forgive me if I ask another question,
a bit more personal this time.

612
01:25:26,702 --> 01:25:30,468
Can you explain to your mother and me
why you lied at school?

613
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:31,898
What?

614
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:35,534
Your teacher has written to me,

615
01:25:35,644 --> 01:25:38,477
saying that you've been spreading
the most incredible lies.

616
01:25:38,581 --> 01:25:39,707
Like what?

617
01:25:39,815 --> 01:25:41,908
Sold to a circus!

618
01:25:42,551 --> 01:25:45,645
Do you deny
that you told your classmates

619
01:25:45,754 --> 01:25:49,383
that I sold you to a traveling circus,

620
01:25:50,126 --> 01:25:52,720
and that at the end of the semester

621
01:25:52,828 --> 01:25:55,296
they're coming to get you?

622
01:25:56,098 --> 01:26:00,000
You are to train
as an acrobat and circus rider,

623
01:26:00,102 --> 01:26:04,095
together with a gypsy
your age named Tamara.

624
01:26:09,378 --> 01:26:12,677
Go to your mother
and ask her forgiveness

625
01:26:12,781 --> 01:26:15,614
for all the sorrow and worry
you've caused her.

626
01:26:18,754 --> 01:26:21,086
Go to your mother
and ask her to forgive you.

627
01:26:25,027 --> 01:26:27,552
You hear what I say, don't you?

628
01:26:34,436 --> 01:26:37,894
I ask Mother's forgiveness for lying,
and I promise never to do it again.

629
01:26:38,474 --> 01:26:39,634
Good, Alexander.

630
01:26:39,742 --> 01:26:42,438
The matter is resolved
and need never be mentioned again.

631
01:26:44,013 --> 01:26:47,471
Imagination is a splendid thing,

632
01:26:48,284 --> 01:26:50,377
a mighty force, a gift from God.

633
01:26:53,789 --> 01:26:57,782
It's held in trust for us
by the great artists,

634
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:00,057
writers and musicians.

635
01:27:09,905 --> 01:27:11,463
I'll get Fanny.

636
01:27:29,091 --> 01:27:30,558
Come, Alexander.

637
01:27:32,294 --> 01:27:34,262
I have something important
to tell you.

638
01:27:37,166 --> 01:27:39,862
Edvard has asked if I will marry him.

639
01:27:40,536 --> 01:27:43,334
I've accepted with gratitude and joy.

640
01:27:44,039 --> 01:27:46,803
I've been alone for a long time,

641
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:50,804
and my children need a firm hand.

642
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:52,545
A father.

643
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:57,544
Of course, a great deal will be -

644
01:28:03,592 --> 01:28:07,494
May God in his mercy
take care of our little family.

645
01:28:10,366 --> 01:28:15,303
Let us kneel down
and unite in a heartfelt prayer.

646
01:28:25,281 --> 01:28:30,412
May God our father in His mercy
take care of our little family

647
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:35,156
and bless us and keep us from evil
all the days of our life.

648
01:28:37,693 --> 01:28:41,789
God give me strength

649
01:28:42,698 --> 01:28:46,225
to be a guardian and a worthy example
to these little fatherless ones.

650
01:28:48,003 --> 01:28:52,269
Give me strength as well
to be a support

651
01:28:54,043 --> 01:28:56,375
to this Ionely young woman.

652
01:29:05,521 --> 01:29:07,921
<i>In the 15th century,</i>
<i>when this house was built,</i>

653
01:29:08,023 --> 01:29:10,321
they didn't bother much about comfort.

654
01:29:11,927 --> 01:29:16,557
My predecessors kept it all as it was,
and I follow the tradition.

655
01:29:18,667 --> 01:29:22,501
These old rooms have
an imperishable beauty.

656
01:29:24,606 --> 01:29:29,407
We should be grateful that we may live
in an atmosphere of purity and austerity.

657
01:29:30,012 --> 01:29:32,674
Ah, here come my mother and sister.

658
01:29:32,781 --> 01:29:34,373
You're already here.

659
01:29:35,484 --> 01:29:37,679
Welcome, Mrs. Ekdahl.

660
01:29:37,953 --> 01:29:38,851
Thank you.

661
01:29:39,588 --> 01:29:41,783
This is my sister Henrietta.

662
01:29:42,424 --> 01:29:45,222
- Welcome to the bishop's palace.
- Thank you.

663
01:29:46,695 --> 01:29:48,663
Come and say hello, children.

664
01:29:53,569 --> 01:29:56,663
This is Mrs. Tander,
our capable cook,

665
01:29:56,772 --> 01:29:58,899
who's been with our family
for 30 years.

666
01:29:59,007 --> 01:30:02,101
This is my future wife,
Mrs. Emilie Ekdahl.

667
01:30:02,211 --> 01:30:05,669
Good day, Mrs. Ekdahl. Welcome.

668
01:30:05,781 --> 01:30:11,014
These are our capable helpers:
Karna, Selma and little Justina.

669
01:30:11,487 --> 01:30:14,752
Now we'll go see my aunt,
who, alas, is sick and bedridden.

670
01:30:21,897 --> 01:30:24,127
How are you today, Aunt Elsa?

671
01:30:25,367 --> 01:30:27,927
We have a visitor.

672
01:30:28,036 --> 01:30:30,095
Don't be afraid, children.
Come and say hello.

673
01:30:30,205 --> 01:30:35,142
My future wife, Mrs. Emilie Ekdahl,
the famous actress.

674
01:30:36,412 --> 01:30:37,674
Hello, Miss Bergius.

675
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,299
The children have fallen asleep.

676
01:31:07,409 --> 01:31:09,172
It's late and we must go home.

677
01:31:09,278 --> 01:31:12,042
- Not yet.
- What is it, Edvard?

678
01:31:12,648 --> 01:31:14,548
I have a wish.

679
01:31:15,284 --> 01:31:17,218
A single wish, but an important one.

680
01:31:17,319 --> 01:31:21,187
You may change your mind
if you find it impossible.

681
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:22,917
Tell me your wish.

682
01:31:23,525 --> 01:31:27,723
I want you to come to my house
without possessions.

683
01:31:28,897 --> 01:31:30,489
What do you mean?

684
01:31:34,269 --> 01:31:36,237
I want you to leave your home...

685
01:31:38,006 --> 01:31:41,442
your clothes, jewels, furniture...

686
01:31:42,744 --> 01:31:44,006
your valuables...

687
01:31:45,414 --> 01:31:48,679
your friends, habits and thoughts.

688
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:53,586
I want you to leave
your former life entirely.

689
01:31:55,257 --> 01:31:57,088
Am I to come naked?

690
01:31:58,227 --> 01:32:00,024
I'm serious, my dear.

691
01:32:00,829 --> 01:32:04,094
I want you to come
to your new life as if newly born.

692
01:32:04,666 --> 01:32:06,463
- And the children?
- The children also.

693
01:32:06,568 --> 01:32:10,060
- Their toys, dolls, books -
- Nothing.

694
01:32:14,142 --> 01:32:16,906
- I must talk to them.
- It's your decision.

695
01:32:17,012 --> 01:32:20,140
I can decide for myself,
but not for the children.

696
01:32:21,216 --> 01:32:22,774
I must ask them.

697
01:32:22,885 --> 01:32:25,285
They must sacrifice something
for their mother's happiness.

698
01:32:25,387 --> 01:32:27,252
You're angry.

699
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:30,189
Kiss me.

700
01:32:37,799 --> 01:32:39,790
I'm not angry, not in the least.

701
01:32:39,902 --> 01:32:41,460
I'll win them over.

702
01:32:41,670 --> 01:32:44,138
Think it over, Emilie.

703
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:47,399
I've already thought it over.

704
01:32:48,544 --> 01:32:51,513
For me it's not hard
to grant your wish.

705
01:32:53,782 --> 01:32:56,376
I've never cared for anything
very seriously.

706
01:32:58,153 --> 01:32:59,882
I've sometimes wondered

707
01:33:00,088 --> 01:33:03,285
if there wasn't something
very wrong with my feelings.

708
01:33:04,593 --> 01:33:07,494
I couldn't understand
why nothing really hurt...

709
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:10,996
why I never felt really happy.

710
01:33:13,802 --> 01:33:16,270
I know now that
the crucial moment has come.

711
01:33:18,073 --> 01:33:21,600
I know that we'll hurt each other,

712
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:24,103
but I'm not afraid.

713
01:33:24,279 --> 01:33:26,941
I also know that we will
make each other happy.

714
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:31,977
And I sometimes weep from fear,
because time is so short,

715
01:33:32,087 --> 01:33:34,817
the days pass so quickly,
and nothing lasts forever.

716
01:33:36,224 --> 01:33:37,885
Kiss me, now,

717
01:33:37,993 --> 01:33:41,224
and hold me in your arms,
as only you can.

718
01:33:46,668 --> 01:33:50,536
<i>I, Olof Henrik Edvard Vergerus...</i>

719
01:33:55,310 --> 01:33:59,804
<i>take thee,</i>
<i>Elisabet Emilie Josefin Ekdahl...</i>

720
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:07,214
<i>to be my wedded wife...</i>

721
01:34:10,826 --> 01:34:13,727
to love you for better and for worse...

722
01:34:17,799 --> 01:34:22,361
and as a symbol of this love
I give you this ring.

723
01:34:31,413 --> 01:34:35,941
I, Elisabet Emilie Josefin Ekdahl...

724
01:34:40,222 --> 01:34:44,386
take thee,
Olof Henrik Edvard Vergerus,

725
01:34:48,463 --> 01:34:51,057
to be my wedded husband...

726
01:34:53,535 --> 01:34:56,436
to love you for better and for worse...

727
01:34:59,474 --> 01:35:03,501
and as a symbol of this love
I take this ring.

728
01:35:12,654 --> 01:35:17,990
In the name of God the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost.

729
01:35:18,093 --> 01:35:19,720
Amen.

730
01:35:22,230 --> 01:35:26,462
For as much as you have consented
in holy wedlock...

731
01:35:41,550 --> 01:35:43,609
I wonder if this is a good thing.

732
01:35:43,885 --> 01:35:46,786
You saw how happy she was.

733
01:35:47,189 --> 01:35:50,522
- I'm thinking of the children.
- They'll get used to it, dear Mama.

734
01:35:53,962 --> 01:35:57,193
He's a devil of a lady killer,
the bishop is.

735
01:35:57,299 --> 01:35:59,324
You don't know that for sure, Carl.

736
01:36:00,469 --> 01:36:03,165
I don't know
why I just want to cry.

737
01:36:03,505 --> 01:36:06,565
They should have taken a honeymoon.

738
01:36:06,675 --> 01:36:10,577
I invited them to our house in Provence,
but Emilie refused.

739
01:36:10,679 --> 01:36:12,670
That's not so strange.

740
01:36:12,781 --> 01:36:15,272
She has great respect
for her new husband.

741
01:36:16,017 --> 01:36:18,713
He's a handsome man,
whatever you say.

742
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:22,620
- I expect he has false teeth.
- Petra, don't be silly.

743
01:36:22,991 --> 01:36:25,482
His mother was nice.

744
01:36:25,727 --> 01:36:28,195
They say the sister's a bitch.

745
01:36:28,296 --> 01:36:31,527
I've a feeling we'll have Emilie back...

746
01:36:33,368 --> 01:36:35,199
quite soon.

747
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:54,980
The children don't appear
to have an appetite.

748
01:36:55,323 --> 01:36:59,259
Everything's new and strange to them.
You must understand, Henrietta.

749
01:36:59,361 --> 01:37:02,956
Perhaps they're turning up
their noses at the food.

750
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:07,625
Let's be happy
on our first evening together.

751
01:37:08,703 --> 01:37:11,103
I have no desire to spoil it,

752
01:37:11,807 --> 01:37:14,708
but in the future -

753
01:37:15,544 --> 01:37:18,240
Yes, I might as well mention it now.

754
01:37:18,713 --> 01:37:21,807
In the future no one may leave the table
without having eaten up -

755
01:37:21,917 --> 01:37:26,354
Dearest Henrietta,
I'll tell my children what to do.

756
01:37:26,454 --> 01:37:30,857
There's a basic rule in this house
which no one must break,

757
01:37:31,226 --> 01:37:33,456
not even you, dear Emilie,

758
01:37:34,062 --> 01:37:37,520
and that is respect
for the temporal gifts.

759
01:37:37,632 --> 01:37:40,931
I think you've misunderstood
an essential point, dearest Henrietta.

760
01:37:42,137 --> 01:37:45,470
But I suggest we postpone this discussion
to a more suitable time.

761
01:37:45,574 --> 01:37:49,203
Forgive me, dear Emilie.
I am forgetting myself.

762
01:37:49,477 --> 01:37:51,968
I'm sure you're a more capable
housewife than I.

763
01:37:52,247 --> 01:37:54,408
I'll ask your advice in all things.

764
01:37:54,749 --> 01:37:57,616
Edvard has admonished me
a hundred times.

765
01:37:59,020 --> 01:38:01,853
It's not easy to realize

766
01:38:02,023 --> 01:38:04,958
one has become superfluous!

767
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:06,220
That will do, Henrietta.

768
01:38:27,148 --> 01:38:29,343
Perhaps I may be allowed to share

769
01:38:29,618 --> 01:38:33,748
that we are early risers in this house,
both weekdays and Sundays.

770
01:38:34,389 --> 01:38:37,688
At 6:00 we gather
for morning prayers in Edvard's study.

771
01:38:39,261 --> 01:38:42,492
I'd also like to mention that we make
our own beds and tidy our rooms.

772
01:38:43,531 --> 01:38:47,262
In this house, punctuality,
cleanliness and order are the rule.

773
01:38:48,103 --> 01:38:49,832
Don't be alarmed, children.

774
01:38:49,938 --> 01:38:52,702
My daughter makes it sound
worse than it actually is.

775
01:38:52,974 --> 01:38:54,771
We'll start out very gently.

776
01:38:54,876 --> 01:38:57,242
I'm not sure I understand.

777
01:38:57,445 --> 01:39:00,107
If you mean to apply
a new method of upbringing -

778
01:39:00,215 --> 01:39:03,048
Not at all, dear Emilie.

779
01:39:03,518 --> 01:39:06,954
I'm convinced that the children
will soon realize

780
01:39:07,055 --> 01:39:10,047
how fun it is to perform
one's duties conscientiously.

781
01:39:10,458 --> 01:39:13,291
It's all to be like a game.

782
01:39:13,395 --> 01:39:16,956
My children don't care
for that sort of game,

783
01:39:17,065 --> 01:39:18,362
and neither do I.

784
01:39:18,466 --> 01:39:20,434
Time will tell, dear Emilie.

785
01:39:31,046 --> 01:39:35,142
They're coming now.
Into bed, both of you!

786
01:39:42,657 --> 01:39:44,488
Now we'll say our prayers.

787
01:39:48,997 --> 01:39:51,966
Thank you, God, for this day.
Please make me good.

788
01:39:52,067 --> 01:39:53,864
May your angel stay by me
through the night.

789
01:39:53,969 --> 01:39:55,994
God bless Papa and Mama
and Grandpapa and Grand -

790
01:39:56,104 --> 01:39:57,628
And Uncle Edvard.

791
01:39:58,640 --> 01:39:59,971
And Uncle Edvard,

792
01:40:00,141 --> 01:40:02,837
myself and my brothers and sisters
and cousins, uncles and aunts,

793
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:06,038
Vega, Ester, Maj,
Siri, Berta, Alida, Lisen,

794
01:40:06,147 --> 01:40:08,411
and Uncle Isak
and everybody else. Amen.

795
01:40:12,087 --> 01:40:13,577
Good night, Alexander.

796
01:40:14,222 --> 01:40:17,680
Justina, I'd like to speak to you
about tomorrow.

797
01:40:27,002 --> 01:40:29,402
What's that book you're reading,
Alexander?

798
01:40:43,385 --> 01:40:46,684
What's that book you're reading,
Alexander?

799
01:40:55,263 --> 01:40:57,254
Good night, my boy.

800
01:41:13,515 --> 01:41:15,483
Good night, my child.
God bless you.

801
01:41:16,418 --> 01:41:17,976
Good night, Uncle Edvard.

802
01:41:25,493 --> 01:41:28,690
My dearest wish is for us to live
at peace with one another.

803
01:41:32,901 --> 01:41:34,926
Love cannot be commanded,

804
01:41:36,438 --> 01:41:38,804
but we can show respect
and consideration.

805
01:41:44,012 --> 01:41:46,071
You go ahead, my dear.
I'll come later.

806
01:41:56,291 --> 01:41:57,918
Whose doll house is this?

807
01:41:58,693 --> 01:42:01,787
Fifteen years ago,
two little girls lived in this room.

808
01:42:02,430 --> 01:42:05,194
They drowned in the river
with their mother.

809
01:42:05,934 --> 01:42:10,200
- Perhaps the house is haunted.
- There are no such things as ghosts.

810
01:42:12,307 --> 01:42:15,401
- Did they live in this room?
- I think this was the nursery.

811
01:42:15,677 --> 01:42:17,440
Good night. Sleep well.

812
01:42:17,912 --> 01:42:20,312
I think we've got
a terrible stepfather.

813
01:42:20,415 --> 01:42:22,679
And the sister is crazy.

814
01:42:22,784 --> 01:42:25,753
And that tub of lard
that has to be fed.

815
01:42:25,854 --> 01:42:27,253
I don't want to live here.

816
01:42:38,333 --> 01:42:40,528
You have to give me time.

817
01:42:41,169 --> 01:42:43,069
Much has to be changed.

818
01:42:43,872 --> 01:42:47,308
Some things will go quickly,
others will take time.

819
01:42:48,176 --> 01:42:50,542
The main thing is not to lose heart.

820
01:42:50,845 --> 01:42:53,177
Why did you marry the bishop?

821
01:42:53,515 --> 01:42:57,178
Because I love him.

822
01:42:57,986 --> 01:43:02,753
Now let us sleep. Things will seem
better when we're not so tired.

823
01:43:08,963 --> 01:43:11,397
Don't play Hamlet, my son.

824
01:43:11,933 --> 01:43:13,764
I'm not Queen Gertrude,

825
01:43:13,868 --> 01:43:16,302
your kind stepfather
isn't the King of Denmark,

826
01:43:16,504 --> 01:43:18,369
and this is not Elsinore Castle,

827
01:43:18,706 --> 01:43:21,140
even if it does look rather gloomy.

828
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:34,417
Hell and damnation.

829
01:43:38,893 --> 01:43:40,724
Come, Fanny.
I'll show you something.

830
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:54,233
The windows are barred.

831
01:43:54,776 --> 01:43:56,368
They can't be opened.

832
01:43:59,948 --> 01:44:04,908
<i>FANNYAND ALEXANDER</i>
WILL CONTINUE IN A MOMENT

833
01:44:16,131 --> 01:44:21,091
<i>FANNYAND ALEXANDER</i>
WILL NOW CONTINUE

834
01:45:35,442 --> 01:45:39,572
Yes, Oscar, that's how it is.

835
01:45:40,213 --> 01:45:43,614
One is old and a child
at the same time.

836
01:45:46,086 --> 01:45:50,113
What became
of those long years in between

837
01:45:50,990 --> 01:45:53,481
that seemed so important
at the time?

838
01:46:04,504 --> 01:46:06,131
May I take your hand?

839
01:46:11,978 --> 01:46:14,640
I remember your hand as a child.

840
01:46:14,748 --> 01:46:18,479
It was small and firm and dry.

841
01:46:21,654 --> 01:46:25,090
And your wrist
was so awfully slender.

842
01:46:28,695 --> 01:46:30,686
I enjoyed being a mother.

843
01:46:31,064 --> 01:46:34,591
I enjoyed being an actress, too,
but I preferred being a mother.

844
01:46:36,469 --> 01:46:39,029
I liked having a big belly,

845
01:46:39,506 --> 01:46:42,475
and I didn't give two shakes
about the theater then.

846
01:46:46,679 --> 01:46:49,045
It's all acting anyway.

847
01:46:49,416 --> 01:46:51,714
Some roles are nice,
others not so nice.

848
01:46:52,952 --> 01:46:55,477
I played a mother.

849
01:46:55,588 --> 01:46:57,783
I played Juliet and Margareta.

850
01:46:58,892 --> 01:47:02,055
Then suddenly I played a widow
or a grandmother.

851
01:47:02,695 --> 01:47:04,890
One role follows the other.

852
01:47:06,266 --> 01:47:08,791
The thing is
not to shrink from them.

853
01:47:11,204 --> 01:47:14,469
But what became of it all?

854
01:47:15,775 --> 01:47:18,209
Can you tell me that, my boy?

855
01:47:21,548 --> 01:47:23,106
You're a good boy

856
01:47:23,383 --> 01:47:28,753
to listen to your old mother's soliloquies,
as Isak calls them.

857
01:47:33,326 --> 01:47:36,193
Yes, you're a good boy, Oscar...

858
01:47:38,598 --> 01:47:41,089
and I grieved terribly
when you past away.

859
01:47:44,671 --> 01:47:47,504
That was a strange role to play.

860
01:47:48,741 --> 01:47:51,437
My feelings came
from deep in my body.

861
01:47:53,213 --> 01:47:55,010
Even though I could control them...

862
01:47:57,083 --> 01:48:01,884
they shattered reality,
if you know what I mean.

863
01:48:05,959 --> 01:48:08,757
Reality has remained broken
ever since...

864
01:48:09,863 --> 01:48:12,957
and, oddly enough,
it feels more real that way.

865
01:48:16,469 --> 01:48:19,632
So I don't bother to mend it.

866
01:48:20,573 --> 01:48:23,974
I just don't care anymore
if nothing makes sense.

867
01:48:29,582 --> 01:48:31,880
Oscar, my dear boy?

868
01:48:31,985 --> 01:48:34,476
- Yes, Mama.
- Are you sad?

869
01:48:35,822 --> 01:48:37,050
I'm worried.

870
01:48:37,156 --> 01:48:39,090
About the children?

871
01:48:44,797 --> 01:48:46,196
Yes.

872
01:48:55,208 --> 01:48:56,539
Supper time.

873
01:49:06,419 --> 01:49:08,478
Then you are to go straight to bed.

874
01:49:10,523 --> 01:49:12,423
The tray can be left until tomorrow.

875
01:49:15,862 --> 01:49:18,160
Mrs. Tander sent some cookies for you.

876
01:49:18,765 --> 01:49:22,826
I'll be upset if Miss Vergerus
finds out I gave these to you.

877
01:49:22,936 --> 01:49:24,563
Hasn't Mother returned?

878
01:49:24,671 --> 01:49:27,663
No, your mother has not returned.

879
01:49:27,774 --> 01:49:29,799
She said she'd be back this evening.

880
01:49:30,410 --> 01:49:33,402
Oh, dear, I don't know what to say.

881
01:49:33,746 --> 01:49:35,907
Why do you keep sighing like that?

882
01:49:38,017 --> 01:49:40,349
I haven't been in this house long,
thank goodness...

883
01:49:42,021 --> 01:49:45,320
but Mrs. Tander,
who's been here since the first wife,

884
01:49:45,425 --> 01:49:47,325
could tell you a thing or two.

885
01:49:48,161 --> 01:49:50,129
Would you like a cookie?

886
01:49:53,266 --> 01:49:55,700
- Yes, thank you.
- What does Mrs. Tander say?

887
01:49:56,469 --> 01:49:59,905
That it was the same
in the first wife's day.

888
01:50:01,975 --> 01:50:03,237
Only worse.

889
01:50:07,647 --> 01:50:09,979
Poor children.
- You mean us?

890
01:50:11,150 --> 01:50:13,778
No, I don't mean you.

891
01:50:15,321 --> 01:50:19,815
I mean the poor little ones who found
their grave in the dark river outside.

892
01:50:21,728 --> 01:50:23,491
Their mother tried to save them,

893
01:50:23,863 --> 01:50:25,956
but she was pulled down
by the current.

894
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:29,900
They found them later by the bridge.

895
01:50:32,572 --> 01:50:34,733
They clung tightly to each other

896
01:50:34,841 --> 01:50:37,810
as if they were one big body.

897
01:50:41,147 --> 01:50:44,878
The arms had to be sawn off
to get the bodies into separate coffins.

898
01:50:46,386 --> 01:50:50,288
Mrs. Tander says that since then,
it has never been quiet in this house.

899
01:50:50,556 --> 01:50:52,421
There are no ghosts.

900
01:50:52,692 --> 01:50:55,593
I don't mean to frighten you...

901
01:50:57,830 --> 01:51:00,993
but this house
does funny things to you.

902
01:51:01,634 --> 01:51:03,101
Look at my hand.

903
01:51:03,536 --> 01:51:07,632
Skin's been completely ripped off,
stripped down to the flesh.

904
01:51:11,044 --> 01:51:13,512
I was taking his grace his coffee.

905
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:17,640
When I grabbed the doorknob,
the skin stuck and ripped off.

906
01:51:20,186 --> 01:51:22,780
Someone laughed behind me.

907
01:51:23,790 --> 01:51:26,350
I heard it clearly and turned around.

908
01:51:29,729 --> 01:51:32,289
But there was no one there.

909
01:51:34,767 --> 01:51:36,735
I feel sorry for anyone who -

910
01:51:38,137 --> 01:51:40,503
I shouldn't chatter on like this.

911
01:51:41,007 --> 01:51:42,565
I'll keep quiet.

912
01:51:44,110 --> 01:51:45,737
I'll close the door now.

913
01:51:52,151 --> 01:51:53,812
Don't worry.

914
01:51:54,754 --> 01:51:56,722
Your mother will probably
be back tomorrow,

915
01:51:56,823 --> 01:52:01,658
and His Grace will personally
release you from captivity.

916
01:52:03,629 --> 01:52:06,427
- I've seen them.
- Who?

917
01:52:07,033 --> 01:52:08,591
The woman and the children.

918
01:52:09,602 --> 01:52:11,194
Is that the truth?

919
01:52:11,871 --> 01:52:14,203
Are you telling the truth, Alexander?

920
01:52:14,307 --> 01:52:16,639
Word of honor as a Swedish citizen.

921
01:52:16,743 --> 01:52:18,540
Where did you see them?

922
01:52:18,811 --> 01:52:22,645
I had been in the library
with that man who married my mother.

923
01:52:22,749 --> 01:52:24,649
He'd been lecturing me.

924
01:52:25,752 --> 01:52:27,777
I don't remember why.

925
01:52:29,322 --> 01:52:31,449
I was passing through
the dining room...

926
01:52:32,592 --> 01:52:35,117
and it was unusually bright.

927
01:52:36,028 --> 01:52:39,429
Then I saw a little girl
in the doorway.

928
01:52:39,732 --> 01:52:43,259
She ran past me without a sound.

929
01:52:45,104 --> 01:52:47,834
Then I saw the older girl,

930
01:52:47,940 --> 01:52:51,103
with the dark hair and big eyes.

931
01:52:53,646 --> 01:52:56,137
She stopped and looked at me

932
01:52:56,249 --> 01:53:00,208
and motioned to me to turn around.

933
01:53:02,822 --> 01:53:07,623
And there in the bright sunlight...

934
01:53:08,795 --> 01:53:13,323
stood the woman in her black dress.

935
01:53:16,502 --> 01:53:20,666
She said in a faint,
almost inaudible voice...

936
01:53:22,608 --> 01:53:24,269
not to be afraid,

937
01:53:24,610 --> 01:53:26,441
that she had something to tell me.

938
01:53:27,413 --> 01:53:28,880
What did she say?

939
01:53:28,981 --> 01:53:31,006
I don't want to frighten anyone,

940
01:53:31,918 --> 01:53:34,478
but these were her very words:

941
01:53:37,390 --> 01:53:40,450
"I want you to know our secret.

942
01:53:42,795 --> 01:53:46,287
Your stepfather, my husband,

943
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:50,827
locked me and my children
in the bedchamber.

944
01:53:53,272 --> 01:53:57,299
For five days and nights

945
01:53:57,910 --> 01:54:00,378
he kept us without food and water.

946
01:54:02,715 --> 01:54:05,741
In our misery

947
01:54:05,852 --> 01:54:07,479
we decided to escape.

948
01:54:08,221 --> 01:54:13,090
We tied sheets together
and tried to climb down

949
01:54:13,492 --> 01:54:18,156
to the finger of land sticking out
into the deep, swirling water.

950
01:54:20,132 --> 01:54:22,566
My daughters went first,

951
01:54:23,035 --> 01:54:26,198
but they fell headfirst into the water

952
01:54:26,539 --> 01:54:28,803
and were dragged under.

953
01:54:30,610 --> 01:54:32,373
I tried to save them

954
01:54:32,745 --> 01:54:37,682
but was sucked down into a black whirlpool
that grabbed my clothes.

955
01:54:39,619 --> 01:54:43,487
Underwater I grasped
my children's hands

956
01:54:44,257 --> 01:54:46,748
and drew them to me."

957
01:54:57,036 --> 01:54:59,231
Why, it's Maj! How nice.

958
01:54:59,538 --> 01:55:00,903
Come in, dear child.

959
01:55:02,708 --> 01:55:04,175
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

960
01:55:04,377 --> 01:55:07,471
Not at all.
Give me a kiss.

961
01:55:08,414 --> 01:55:10,041
That's nice.

962
01:55:11,250 --> 01:55:14,413
Very pretty.
Did you make it yourself?

963
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:15,782
Yes.

964
01:55:16,088 --> 01:55:17,988
A pretty pattern.

965
01:55:19,325 --> 01:55:21,020
So you didn't go on the excursion?

966
01:55:21,127 --> 01:55:23,391
No, I wouldn't fit in the boat
with my big belly.

967
01:55:23,496 --> 01:55:25,293
Nonsense.

968
01:55:26,632 --> 01:55:29,965
Is something wrong?
- I'm silly to worry.

969
01:55:30,436 --> 01:55:32,233
Let's sit here.

970
01:55:35,174 --> 01:55:36,801
You're worried about the children?

971
01:55:38,678 --> 01:55:41,545
Alexander and I agreed to write.

972
01:55:41,948 --> 01:55:43,745
I've written seven letters.

973
01:55:44,150 --> 01:55:45,811
And you've received no reply?

974
01:55:45,918 --> 01:55:47,943
One postcard three weeks ago.

975
01:55:49,622 --> 01:55:51,817
"Dear Maj. We are well.

976
01:55:52,158 --> 01:55:55,889
Uncle Edvard took us to..."

977
01:55:55,995 --> 01:55:57,462
The botanical gardens.

978
01:55:57,563 --> 01:56:03,058
"We learned about rare flowers."

979
01:56:04,303 --> 01:56:08,069
"Thank you for your letters.
I'll write when I get some time.

980
01:56:08,574 --> 01:56:11,065
Love from Alexander.

981
01:56:11,610 --> 01:56:13,339
Fanny sends her love."

982
01:56:22,388 --> 01:56:24,219
We mustn't underestimate Emilie.

983
01:56:24,423 --> 01:56:27,085
She's perfectly capable
of looking after her children.

984
01:56:27,927 --> 01:56:30,418
We're worrying for no reason.

985
01:56:30,930 --> 01:56:33,057
I came to the family
before Fanny was born.

986
01:56:33,165 --> 01:56:34,792
They're my children too.

987
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:36,265
You're going already?

988
01:56:36,369 --> 01:56:39,827
I wanted to speak with you,
since I knew you were alone.

989
01:56:39,939 --> 01:56:41,566
Stay a moment.

990
01:56:41,674 --> 01:56:44,006
Thank you for your kindness,

991
01:56:44,110 --> 01:56:46,874
but I promised to have dinner ready
when they came home.

992
01:56:47,246 --> 01:56:49,612
I haven't put the steak
in the oven yet.

993
01:56:49,715 --> 01:56:53,242
Dear child, are things that bad?

994
01:56:53,786 --> 01:56:55,014
Yes.

995
01:56:55,654 --> 01:56:58,885
- Is it the caf�?
- That too.

996
01:56:59,825 --> 01:57:02,259
Has Gustav Adolf been pestering you?

997
01:57:03,162 --> 01:57:05,426
I don't want to hurt him.
He's so kind.

998
01:57:07,633 --> 01:57:10,101
What worries me most
is the children.

999
01:57:13,973 --> 01:57:17,739
I'm sorry to be crying.
I'm behaving badly.

1000
01:57:18,444 --> 01:57:20,469
Forgive me.

1001
01:57:46,672 --> 01:57:52,440
Mrs. Tander wants to know
if Your Grace will have supper alone.

1002
01:57:53,279 --> 01:57:55,747
Tell her I don't want any supper.

1003
01:57:55,848 --> 01:57:58,646
A glass of milk and a sandwich
in my room will be sufficient.

1004
01:57:58,751 --> 01:58:00,981
Thank you, sir. I'll tell her.

1005
01:58:04,490 --> 01:58:05,957
Was there something else?

1006
01:58:07,293 --> 01:58:08,760
I don't know.

1007
01:58:11,297 --> 01:58:15,028
I don't know how to say it.
It's so unpleasant. It might seem -

1008
01:58:15,134 --> 01:58:16,533
Well?

1009
01:58:17,136 --> 01:58:19,331
Sir, I can't stand here
in the doorway.

1010
01:58:20,906 --> 01:58:22,669
Come in, then, and close the door.

1011
01:58:27,346 --> 01:58:30,213
You said I was to keep an eye
on the children,

1012
01:58:30,983 --> 01:58:35,283
listen to their conversation
and tell you of anything unusual.

1013
01:58:35,387 --> 01:58:36,615
Well?

1014
01:58:38,057 --> 01:58:40,753
Alexander made up a terrible story.

1015
01:58:41,026 --> 01:58:42,254
Really?

1016
01:58:42,795 --> 01:58:44,285
It was about -

1017
01:58:45,464 --> 01:58:48,524
Oh, it's so awful
I don't know how to get it out.

1018
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:55,897
He says you locked
your first wife up,

1019
01:58:56,008 --> 01:59:00,274
and she was drowned with her children
when they tried to escape.

1020
01:59:11,223 --> 01:59:14,681
- That's all, sir.
- You can go.

1021
01:59:34,580 --> 01:59:36,013
Who's there?

1022
01:59:37,016 --> 01:59:38,381
It's just me.

1023
01:59:55,968 --> 01:59:58,630
Get up. Your stepfather
wants to talk to you.

1024
02:00:02,007 --> 02:00:04,407
Get dressed.
Your stepfather wants to talk to you.

1025
02:00:08,781 --> 02:00:09,907
Hurry up!

1026
02:00:11,984 --> 02:00:13,884
Alexander, my boy.

1027
02:00:15,554 --> 02:00:18,489
In the presence of your sister
and Justina you have accused me

1028
02:00:18,591 --> 02:00:20,650
of having murdered
my wife and children.

1029
02:00:20,759 --> 02:00:21,748
What?

1030
02:00:22,928 --> 02:00:25,192
Justina, please repeat
what you told me.

1031
02:00:26,398 --> 02:00:29,333
Alexander said he had seen
your first wife and children.

1032
02:00:30,369 --> 02:00:35,932
She spoke to him
and said that the bishop

1033
02:00:36,041 --> 02:00:41,206
had locked them all up
without food and water.

1034
02:00:42,681 --> 02:00:45,707
On the fifth day they tried to escape

1035
02:00:45,818 --> 02:00:47,649
but drowned in the attempt.

1036
02:00:47,886 --> 02:00:50,878
- Do you recognize the story?
- No.

1037
02:00:53,259 --> 02:00:57,662
- So Justina has given false testimony?
- She could have dreamt it.

1038
02:00:58,831 --> 02:01:02,198
Justina, are you prepared to confirm
your statement under oath?

1039
02:01:02,301 --> 02:01:03,700
Yes, Your Grace.

1040
02:01:03,969 --> 02:01:05,664
Good, Justina.

1041
02:01:05,771 --> 02:01:08,433
Fanny, did you hear
Alexander's story?

1042
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:09,529
No.

1043
02:01:15,247 --> 02:01:18,842
So you maintain that Justina

1044
02:01:19,618 --> 02:01:22,985
was either lying or dreaming?

1045
02:01:23,255 --> 02:01:24,279
Yes.

1046
02:01:31,730 --> 02:01:33,755
Please come here, Alexander.

1047
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:37,663
Are you prepared to swear to it?

1048
02:01:37,770 --> 02:01:39,135
Of course.

1049
02:01:39,238 --> 02:01:41,604
It's a mortal sin to swear falsely.

1050
02:01:43,108 --> 02:01:46,635
It's called perjury
and is severely punished.

1051
02:01:47,646 --> 02:01:48,943
Really?

1052
02:01:50,949 --> 02:01:53,509
Lay your hand on the Bible
and say after me:

1053
02:01:56,188 --> 02:01:57,917
"I, Alexander Ekdahl...

1054
02:02:00,326 --> 02:02:03,955
swear by Holy Writ
and by the living God...

1055
02:02:08,067 --> 02:02:12,663
that all I have said,
say and will say...

1056
02:02:17,509 --> 02:02:20,205
is the whole truth
and nothing but the truth."

1057
02:02:28,153 --> 02:02:30,053
Alexander, my boy.

1058
02:02:32,057 --> 02:02:34,025
You remember that the two of us

1059
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:38,291
had an important conversation
about a year ago.

1060
02:02:38,397 --> 02:02:40,365
It concerned certain moral questions.

1061
02:02:40,899 --> 02:02:43,060
It wasn't really a conversation.

1062
02:02:46,271 --> 02:02:47,761
What do you mean?

1063
02:02:47,873 --> 02:02:50,535
The bishop spoke
and Alexander said nothing.

1064
02:02:52,077 --> 02:02:55,240
And felt ashamed, perhaps,
on account of your lies.

1065
02:02:56,315 --> 02:02:58,306
I've grown wiser since then.

1066
02:02:59,818 --> 02:03:01,752
You mean you lie better.

1067
02:03:02,087 --> 02:03:03,384
More or less.

1068
02:03:11,764 --> 02:03:13,561
I don't know what you imagine.

1069
02:03:13,665 --> 02:03:19,297
Do you think you can besmirch
another person's honor with impunity?

1070
02:03:20,472 --> 02:03:24,602
I think the bishop hates Alexander.
That's what I think.

1071
02:03:25,844 --> 02:03:28,312
Oh, so that's what you think.

1072
02:03:31,116 --> 02:03:33,050
I'll tell you something

1073
02:03:34,286 --> 02:03:36,481
that may come as a surprise.

1074
02:03:38,724 --> 02:03:40,385
I don't hate you.

1075
02:03:43,228 --> 02:03:44,786
I love you.

1076
02:03:45,931 --> 02:03:50,959
But the love I feel for you

1077
02:03:51,937 --> 02:03:54,064
and your mother and sister

1078
02:03:54,306 --> 02:03:56,501
is not blind and sloppy.

1079
02:03:57,209 --> 02:04:00,303
It is strong and harsh.

1080
02:04:04,650 --> 02:04:07,141
Do you hear what I say?
- No.

1081
02:04:13,659 --> 02:04:15,559
You're hardening your heart.

1082
02:04:17,329 --> 02:04:19,820
Moreover, you misjudge the situation.

1083
02:04:21,166 --> 02:04:26,433
I am much stronger than you are.
- I don't doubt it.

1084
02:04:26,538 --> 02:04:28,597
I mean stronger spiritually.

1085
02:04:30,042 --> 02:04:32,772
Because I have truth and justice

1086
02:04:32,878 --> 02:04:34,345
on my side.

1087
02:04:43,288 --> 02:04:47,247
I know you'll confess
in a little while.

1088
02:04:47,726 --> 02:04:52,686
Your confession and punishment
will be a relief to you.

1089
02:04:55,267 --> 02:04:57,201
You're a wise little man, Alexander.

1090
02:04:57,302 --> 02:04:59,702
You realize that the game is up...

1091
02:05:00,873 --> 02:05:05,173
but you are proud and stubborn...

1092
02:05:07,079 --> 02:05:09,309
and of course you are ashamed.

1093
02:05:09,414 --> 02:05:11,541
I've forgotten what I'm to confess.

1094
02:05:12,384 --> 02:05:13,749
Have you now.

1095
02:05:14,486 --> 02:05:16,613
What does the bishop want
Alexander to confess?

1096
02:05:16,722 --> 02:05:19,088
You know I have means at my disposal.

1097
02:05:19,191 --> 02:05:20,886
I didn't, but I do now.

1098
02:05:22,528 --> 02:05:25,053
In my childhood,
parents were not so softhearted.

1099
02:05:26,331 --> 02:05:29,164
They had the cane.
I have one too.

1100
02:05:29,268 --> 02:05:33,136
It's an ordinary carpet beater,
but it can dance a fine step!

1101
02:05:34,606 --> 02:05:39,236
If that didn't work, we had other
effective means, namely castor oil.

1102
02:05:39,344 --> 02:05:41,938
There you see the bottle and a glass.

1103
02:05:42,748 --> 02:05:46,741
A few mouthfuls of this
and you're more docile.

1104
02:05:48,186 --> 02:05:53,283
If that didn't help,
there was a dark and cold cubbyhole

1105
02:05:54,226 --> 02:05:57,821
where you sat for a few hours until
the rats started sniffing at your face.

1106
02:05:59,331 --> 02:06:00,992
Why must I be punished?

1107
02:06:02,901 --> 02:06:05,233
That is obvious, my boy.

1108
02:06:06,238 --> 02:06:08,706
You have a weakness in your character.

1109
02:06:08,807 --> 02:06:10,672
You can't distinguish lies from truth.

1110
02:06:10,776 --> 02:06:15,804
So far they are just child's lies,
however dreadful they may be.

1111
02:06:17,883 --> 02:06:21,546
But soon you will be
a grown man, Alexander,

1112
02:06:22,588 --> 02:06:25,682
and life punishes liars
ruthlessly and indiscriminately.

1113
02:06:28,594 --> 02:06:33,054
The punishment is to teach you

1114
02:06:33,165 --> 02:06:34,689
a love of truth.

1115
02:06:36,835 --> 02:06:41,101
I confess I made it up about locking
your wife and children in.

1116
02:06:43,308 --> 02:06:47,404
- Do you also confess to perjury?
- I suppose so.

1117
02:06:48,113 --> 02:06:52,516
Now you've won a great victory.

1118
02:06:54,820 --> 02:06:56,788
A victory over yourself.

1119
02:07:00,926 --> 02:07:02,587
Which punishment do you choose?

1120
02:07:02,694 --> 02:07:05,492
Cane, castor oil
or the dark cubbyhole?

1121
02:07:06,865 --> 02:07:09,527
- How many strokes of the cane?
- Ten.

1122
02:07:09,635 --> 02:07:11,262
Then I choose the cane.

1123
02:07:15,907 --> 02:07:19,502
Take two cushions
and put them on the table.

1124
02:07:23,482 --> 02:07:25,473
Pull your pants down.

1125
02:07:30,155 --> 02:07:31,213
Bend over.

1126
02:08:09,494 --> 02:08:11,189
Stand up.

1127
02:08:12,364 --> 02:08:14,594
- You have something to say to me.
- No.

1128
02:08:16,134 --> 02:08:18,227
You must ask my forgiveness.

1129
02:08:18,904 --> 02:08:20,599
I won't.

1130
02:08:21,907 --> 02:08:24,637
Then I must cane you
until you think better of it.

1131
02:08:24,743 --> 02:08:27,473
Can't you spare us both
that unpleasant experience?

1132
02:08:27,579 --> 02:08:29,479
I'll never apologize.

1133
02:08:31,083 --> 02:08:34,075
You won't apologize?

1134
02:08:34,486 --> 02:08:35,475
No.

1135
02:08:36,755 --> 02:08:38,450
Bend over.

1136
02:08:42,127 --> 02:08:43,594
No more, please!

1137
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:47,728
Will you ask forgiveness now?

1138
02:08:48,033 --> 02:08:49,091
Yes.

1139
02:08:51,236 --> 02:08:55,366
Button your pants and blow your nose.
Lend him a handkerchief, Justina.

1140
02:08:59,945 --> 02:09:02,778
What do you have to say now?

1141
02:09:05,016 --> 02:09:07,177
Alexander asks the bishop
for forgiveness.

1142
02:09:07,285 --> 02:09:10,721
Speak up.
I want everyone to hear your regret.

1143
02:09:11,456 --> 02:09:14,118
Alexander asks the bishop
for forgiveness.

1144
02:09:14,226 --> 02:09:16,353
For the lies and the perjury.

1145
02:09:21,199 --> 02:09:24,430
You do understand
that I punished you out of love?

1146
02:09:24,536 --> 02:09:25,935
Yes!

1147
02:09:27,405 --> 02:09:29,032
Kiss my hand, Alexander.

1148
02:09:29,741 --> 02:09:31,902
- May I go to bed now?
- Yes, you may.

1149
02:09:34,012 --> 02:09:39,973
But so that you may contemplate
the day's events in peace and quiet...

1150
02:09:41,186 --> 02:09:43,017
you're to sleep in the attic.

1151
02:09:43,522 --> 02:09:46,423
Justina will provide
a mattress and a blanket.

1152
02:09:47,025 --> 02:09:51,985
At 6:00 in the morning
you will be let out. Understood?

1153
02:09:52,097 --> 02:09:53,758
Yes, Your Grace!

1154
02:10:06,878 --> 02:10:10,405
I must go.
A carriage is waiting at the gate.

1155
02:10:11,183 --> 02:10:13,674
I'm afraid something might have happened
while I've been here.

1156
02:10:15,053 --> 02:10:18,545
I'm in constant fear that Alexander
will say something to displease him.

1157
02:10:19,591 --> 02:10:22,321
Alexander is so foolhardy.
I've tried to warn him,

1158
02:10:22,427 --> 02:10:25,555
but he can't see that his stepfather
is a dangerous opponent

1159
02:10:25,931 --> 02:10:28,331
who's just waiting
for the right opportunity to crush him.

1160
02:10:28,433 --> 02:10:30,628
You must leave him, Emilie.

1161
02:10:31,136 --> 02:10:32,899
I'm pregnant.

1162
02:10:33,805 --> 02:10:35,397
Nevertheless, you must -

1163
02:10:35,507 --> 02:10:37,202
Forgive me for interrupting.

1164
02:10:38,310 --> 02:10:40,335
I've asked him for a divorce.

1165
02:10:41,513 --> 02:10:42,980
He refuses.

1166
02:10:44,316 --> 02:10:46,580
I tell him that I'll leave
just the same.

1167
02:10:48,253 --> 02:10:51,416
Then he explains in detail
what will happen.

1168
02:10:53,058 --> 02:10:57,017
In a court of law, I'll lose on grounds
of "desertion," as it's called.

1169
02:10:59,564 --> 02:11:03,193
The children will be taken from me,
to be brought up by him.

1170
02:11:09,774 --> 02:11:13,369
I've written in secret
to a friend of mine who's a lawyer.

1171
02:11:15,847 --> 02:11:18,611
He's confirmed what Edvard says.

1172
02:11:19,584 --> 02:11:21,313
I am shut in

1173
02:11:22,254 --> 02:11:24,518
and can no longer breathe.

1174
02:11:27,559 --> 02:11:29,254
I'm dying, Helena!

1175
02:11:32,297 --> 02:11:34,959
I hate that man so violently

1176
02:11:35,767 --> 02:11:37,257
that I could -

1177
02:11:46,745 --> 02:11:48,838
Don't mention that I've been here.

1178
02:11:49,948 --> 02:11:51,506
To anybody.

1179
02:12:32,257 --> 02:12:34,555
- Give me the key!
- Edvard has forbidden it.

1180
02:12:34,659 --> 02:12:36,183
Give me the key now!

1181
02:12:36,294 --> 02:12:38,421
Edvard has forbidden it!

1182
02:12:40,398 --> 02:12:41,990
You're hurting me!

1183
02:12:48,106 --> 02:12:49,664
Emilie, you can't!

1184
02:13:50,835 --> 02:13:53,633
Take your damn paint box!

1185
02:13:58,443 --> 02:14:00,070
Listen to me.

1186
02:14:00,178 --> 02:14:03,807
I told you, there's none left.

1187
02:14:09,020 --> 02:14:11,011
We're to go up to see Grandmama.

1188
02:14:12,057 --> 02:14:13,752
I'm just shouting!

1189
02:14:15,226 --> 02:14:18,093
Punch will do just as well!

1190
02:14:23,201 --> 02:14:25,431
The old girl's not here.

1191
02:14:26,171 --> 02:14:28,036
She's probably in the dining room.

1192
02:14:28,940 --> 02:14:31,431
Good evening, Mama.
We came to see how you are.

1193
02:14:31,543 --> 02:14:33,135
I'm splendid.

1194
02:14:33,244 --> 02:14:34,871
I hope you aren't Ionely.

1195
02:14:35,080 --> 02:14:38,072
Lonely? I love being alone.

1196
02:14:38,183 --> 02:14:40,151
Vega was bitten by a wasp.

1197
02:14:40,251 --> 02:14:42,515
A wasp stings, my dear.

1198
02:14:42,620 --> 02:14:44,713
It has a stinger
just like your old man.

1199
02:14:44,823 --> 02:14:46,620
Don't pinch me.

1200
02:14:47,292 --> 02:14:49,692
And Petra fell in the lake
and got soaked.

1201
02:14:49,794 --> 02:14:52,524
Where shall I serve supper?

1202
02:14:52,730 --> 02:14:54,357
I don't want any.

1203
02:14:54,466 --> 02:14:57,958
- How's the wasp sting?
- Not worth talking about.

1204
02:15:01,005 --> 02:15:03,200
And Mama is busy
with the old man's photographs.

1205
02:15:03,308 --> 02:15:06,300
How many thousands
have you sorted by now?

1206
02:15:06,578 --> 02:15:09,172
Here's one of you and your brothers.

1207
02:15:09,314 --> 02:15:11,578
You couldn't have been
more than five years old.

1208
02:15:11,683 --> 02:15:15,449
- You can already tell which brother -
- Who is this beautiful woman?

1209
02:15:15,553 --> 02:15:17,612
Did it rain on you the whole time?

1210
02:15:17,722 --> 02:15:19,690
No, not at all, dearest Mama.

1211
02:15:19,791 --> 02:15:21,986
Not a cloud over the outer islands,

1212
02:15:22,093 --> 02:15:25,119
but we saw the rain over the mainland,
and heard the thunder

1213
02:15:25,230 --> 02:15:26,720
It's rained all day here.

1214
02:15:26,831 --> 02:15:31,564
This woman with the low neckline
was one of Papa's lady friends.

1215
02:15:31,936 --> 02:15:34,598
You're mistaken.
We were at school together.

1216
02:15:34,706 --> 02:15:38,472
She married a count, had 12 children
and became as big as a house.

1217
02:15:38,576 --> 02:15:43,639
I always admired your skillful way
of handling Papa's little adventures.

1218
02:15:44,315 --> 02:15:45,748
We must be going.

1219
02:15:45,850 --> 02:15:49,217
Mr. �hman and his lovely wife
are going to stop by.

1220
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:52,255
I'm going into town tomorrow.
Anything I can do for you?

1221
02:15:52,357 --> 02:15:54,882
Thank you, Gusten.
I don't need anything.

1222
02:15:54,993 --> 02:15:57,689
But I'd like to talk
to you about Maj.

1223
02:15:58,463 --> 02:16:01,091
What the hell is it now?
She's got it good.

1224
02:16:01,566 --> 02:16:04,296
Now I'm damned angry -
if you'll excuse me, Mama.

1225
02:16:04,402 --> 02:16:05,892
Calm down, Gusten!

1226
02:16:10,141 --> 02:16:12,507
He loses his temper
at the mention of Maj's name.

1227
02:16:12,610 --> 02:16:14,202
I just want to say -

1228
02:16:14,312 --> 02:16:18,715
You have to realize
Maj is not your private plaything.

1229
02:16:19,184 --> 02:16:22,483
Thanks to Alma's broad-mindedness,
she's a member of our family,

1230
02:16:22,587 --> 02:16:25,317
and she's expecting my grandchild.

1231
02:16:26,191 --> 02:16:29,752
In your dictatorial way,
you've decided her future.

1232
02:16:30,428 --> 02:16:31,690
I don't give a damn -

1233
02:16:31,796 --> 02:16:34,458
I don't like it when you swear
in your mother's presence.

1234
02:16:34,566 --> 02:16:36,625
You hear me, Gusten?

1235
02:16:47,111 --> 02:16:49,705
I like the girl. I wish her well.

1236
02:16:50,381 --> 02:16:52,281
I want to ensure her future.

1237
02:16:52,383 --> 02:16:55,614
I don't want her to be dependent
on the family's benevolence if I die.

1238
02:16:55,720 --> 02:16:57,517
She's accepted my suggestions.

1239
02:16:57,622 --> 02:17:01,649
She doesn't need any protectors,
especially against me.

1240
02:17:01,759 --> 02:17:03,556
Stop your twaddle!

1241
02:17:05,163 --> 02:17:08,894
Don't make me out as a dictator!
Maj has decided it all herself!

1242
02:17:12,136 --> 02:17:13,501
I like her.

1243
02:17:15,406 --> 02:17:17,840
I'm kind to her.
Alma's kind to her.

1244
02:17:17,942 --> 02:17:21,309
Now I'm hurt, let me tell you.
Damned hurt!

1245
02:17:23,781 --> 02:17:26,807
There's no reason
to side with Maj against me!

1246
02:17:31,956 --> 02:17:34,618
I'm fond of her.
Alma's fond of her.

1247
02:17:34,726 --> 02:17:37,627
She is loved in the same way
as Jenny, Petra and Putte.

1248
02:17:37,729 --> 02:17:41,165
Well, not exactly in the same way,
but almost.

1249
02:17:45,069 --> 02:17:46,627
She's good to me.

1250
02:17:46,871 --> 02:17:49,305
She doesn't think
I'm fat and old and disgusting.

1251
02:17:49,407 --> 02:17:51,932
Nobody thinks that, by the -

1252
02:17:52,043 --> 02:17:55,376
I've a soft spot for the ladies.
What's to be done about it?

1253
02:17:56,014 --> 02:17:57,538
That's nothing to giggle at.

1254
02:17:57,782 --> 02:18:00,012
Maj is to go her own way through life,

1255
02:18:00,118 --> 02:18:02,143
and I'm going to give her
solid ground to stand on.

1256
02:18:02,253 --> 02:18:03,880
That's enough said about that.

1257
02:18:03,988 --> 02:18:07,947
The opera singer said he would stop by
with his wife and children. Come now.

1258
02:18:08,926 --> 02:18:11,554
Good-bye, Mama. Give me a kiss.

1259
02:18:13,164 --> 02:18:18,830
I don't want you and Alma
to sit gossiping about Maj's future.

1260
02:18:19,404 --> 02:18:21,429
I'll see to that!

1261
02:18:21,973 --> 02:18:23,770
Or rather, she will.

1262
02:18:25,276 --> 02:18:26,903
Good night, Mama.
Come, Alma.

1263
02:18:27,011 --> 02:18:31,277
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.
- Like hell you will! Come on!

1264
02:18:31,749 --> 02:18:34,912
Calm down or you'll have a stroke.

1265
02:18:35,019 --> 02:18:38,682
I am calm.
You're the one who's shouting.

1266
02:18:38,790 --> 02:18:42,089
I want an end to all that gossip
between you and Mama!

1267
02:20:44,649 --> 02:20:46,879
Good day, Mr. Jacobi.

1268
02:20:47,652 --> 02:20:49,279
Good day, Miss Vergerus.

1269
02:20:49,454 --> 02:20:50,648
What is it?

1270
02:20:50,855 --> 02:20:52,948
Is His Grace -

1271
02:20:53,257 --> 02:20:55,157
He is not to be disturbed.

1272
02:20:55,626 --> 02:20:57,821
May I speak to his wife?

1273
02:20:58,029 --> 02:21:00,361
She is indisposed,
resting in her room -

1274
02:21:00,465 --> 02:21:01,898
And not to be disturbed.

1275
02:21:01,999 --> 02:21:04,092
My mother is out and I am busy.

1276
02:21:04,202 --> 02:21:07,365
His Grace might be annoyed if -

1277
02:21:07,472 --> 02:21:09,201
What is this concerning?

1278
02:21:09,907 --> 02:21:15,174
Some months ago,
His Grace proposed a business deal.

1279
02:21:16,447 --> 02:21:19,041
Really? I don't recall.

1280
02:21:19,150 --> 02:21:20,981
Of course not, Miss Vergerus.

1281
02:21:21,085 --> 02:21:24,987
His Grace is careful to spare
his family such trivial worries.

1282
02:21:25,089 --> 02:21:27,649
What worries of his
could concern you?

1283
02:21:28,526 --> 02:21:30,756
Please don't force me to be vulgar.

1284
02:21:31,195 --> 02:21:34,995
To be candid, Mr. Jacobi,
I find you unpleasant.

1285
02:21:35,266 --> 02:21:38,099
I've neither the time
nor the inclination to speak with you.

1286
02:21:38,569 --> 02:21:41,299
Good-bye, Mr. Jacobi.
- A pecuniary predicament.

1287
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:43,937
I beg your pardon?

1288
02:21:44,041 --> 02:21:48,171
Your brother, His Grace,
was in a pecuniary predicament.

1289
02:21:48,279 --> 02:21:51,305
May I sit down?
- Not there! There.

1290
02:21:52,016 --> 02:21:54,246
In a peculiar way -
I don't know why -

1291
02:21:54,685 --> 02:21:56,676
I appreciate your straightforwardness.

1292
02:21:57,455 --> 02:22:00,288
And I do not appreciate
your fawning.

1293
02:22:01,492 --> 02:22:04,325
What business do you have
with my brother?

1294
02:22:04,962 --> 02:22:06,862
None at all, as far as I know.

1295
02:22:07,398 --> 02:22:09,229
I'm tired of your riddles.

1296
02:22:09,333 --> 02:22:11,062
Tell me what's on your mind and go.

1297
02:22:11,168 --> 02:22:14,535
I must speak to His Grace first.
It's a matter of money.

1298
02:22:15,973 --> 02:22:17,668
A lot of money.

1299
02:22:18,576 --> 02:22:20,476
Does my brother owe you money?

1300
02:22:20,678 --> 02:22:24,239
On the contrary.
It's like this:

1301
02:22:24,715 --> 02:22:27,115
In November
His Grace wanted to borrow money.

1302
02:22:27,218 --> 02:22:31,416
Regrettably, Jews have certain principles,
like never lending money to the clergy.

1303
02:22:31,522 --> 02:22:36,653
He suggested I should buy that chest
for a reasonable sum.

1304
02:22:36,928 --> 02:22:38,395
I declined.

1305
02:22:38,863 --> 02:22:40,797
So you declined.

1306
02:22:41,165 --> 02:22:44,657
Foolishly so,
since I've now changed my mind.

1307
02:22:44,769 --> 02:22:49,638
I'd like to buy that chest,
and at almost any price.

1308
02:22:50,308 --> 02:22:51,605
Almost.

1309
02:22:54,412 --> 02:22:56,243
I will get my brother.

1310
02:23:04,855 --> 02:23:07,187
<i>I told you not to disturb me.</i>

1311
02:23:07,291 --> 02:23:09,623
<i>Mr. Jacobi wants to buy the chest.</i>

1312
02:23:09,727 --> 02:23:11,820
<i>That man hangs on like vermin!</i>

1313
02:23:30,348 --> 02:23:33,317
Stay where you are.
I'll come get you in a few minutes.

1314
02:23:33,417 --> 02:23:35,112
Take your shoes off.

1315
02:23:40,157 --> 02:23:45,094
Forgive an old man's
unfortunate weakness, Your Grace.

1316
02:23:47,798 --> 02:23:50,995
- You wish to buy the chest?
- Yes.

1317
02:23:51,235 --> 02:23:52,930
For how much?

1318
02:23:53,137 --> 02:23:54,968
Here is the sum.

1319
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:05,110
It seems you've changed your mind.

1320
02:24:05,216 --> 02:24:07,275
I may have an interested buyer.

1321
02:24:10,721 --> 02:24:15,215
- I'm being cheated, of course.
- You're free to say no.

1322
02:24:16,360 --> 02:24:18,851
- Do you have you the money with you?
- The money?

1323
02:24:19,063 --> 02:24:22,123
The money!
Of course, Your Grace.

1324
02:24:22,233 --> 02:24:24,167
I have large bills right here.

1325
02:24:24,702 --> 02:24:26,465
Let me see.

1326
02:24:28,139 --> 02:24:31,870
Yes, here they are.

1327
02:24:34,011 --> 02:24:36,809
- Give me the money.
- Of course.

1328
02:24:37,648 --> 02:24:41,709
If I may have Your Grace's name
on the contract?

1329
02:24:44,889 --> 02:24:47,187
Forgive me if I retire.

1330
02:24:47,291 --> 02:24:49,486
I shall miss you, Miss Vergerus.

1331
02:24:49,593 --> 02:24:52,721
Do not take anything
that is not your due.

1332
02:24:53,731 --> 02:24:56,894
Suspicions recoil
on those who harbor them.

1333
02:25:26,964 --> 02:25:31,094
Your Grace will want to ensure
that I'm not taking more than my due.

1334
02:25:31,202 --> 02:25:32,669
That's quite all right.

1335
02:25:32,770 --> 02:25:36,729
I just wanted to return
the signed contract.

1336
02:25:37,508 --> 02:25:39,169
Please have a seat.

1337
02:25:39,877 --> 02:25:42,744
What would you say
about that painting?

1338
02:25:43,214 --> 02:25:45,045
A beautiful and valuable work.

1339
02:25:45,149 --> 02:25:47,208
Would it interest you?

1340
02:25:47,318 --> 02:25:50,116
My resources are regrettably
a bit strained at present.

1341
02:25:51,689 --> 02:25:54,783
How is your wife?
- It's kind of you to inquire.

1342
02:25:55,292 --> 02:25:59,251
She is indisposed.
This sudden heat disagrees with her.

1343
02:25:59,730 --> 02:26:03,222
- May I pay my respects?
- Unfortunately not.

1344
02:26:03,501 --> 02:26:04,866
I understand.

1345
02:26:04,969 --> 02:26:07,802
Here is a letter for her
from old Mrs. Ekdahl.

1346
02:26:08,806 --> 02:26:11,240
- I shall give it to her.
- You're too kind.

1347
02:26:11,342 --> 02:26:15,403
Filthy Jewish swine!
You damned, filthy Jewish swine!

1348
02:26:15,513 --> 02:26:17,413
You thought you could cheat me.

1349
02:26:17,515 --> 02:26:23,476
You'll regret this,
you repulsive, hooknosed bastard!

1350
02:26:24,054 --> 02:26:25,282
Calm down!

1351
02:26:25,389 --> 02:26:27,687
That swine is trying
to steal my children!

1352
02:26:27,792 --> 02:26:31,091
He can't.
I have the key to the nursery.

1353
02:26:53,450 --> 02:26:55,179
Don't touch them!

1354
02:27:42,299 --> 02:27:43,766
Come here.

1355
02:27:45,769 --> 02:27:48,033
First and foremost,
let's have something to eat.

1356
02:27:50,040 --> 02:27:51,735
This is my nephew, Aron.

1357
02:27:54,812 --> 02:27:56,473
Let's go to the table.

1358
02:27:59,016 --> 02:28:00,745
I'd like to sleep.

1359
02:28:04,221 --> 02:28:06,121
Our guests are tired.

1360
02:28:07,024 --> 02:28:10,050
Have you tidied the room
and made the beds?

1361
02:28:10,160 --> 02:28:12,390
I've done all you asked, Uncle.

1362
02:28:34,752 --> 02:28:37,983
This is Aron's puppet theater.

1363
02:28:39,523 --> 02:28:42,458
If you ask him nicely,
he may give a performance.

1364
02:28:53,504 --> 02:28:57,668
Behind this door lives
my nephew Ismael. He's sick.

1365
02:28:58,242 --> 02:29:02,804
The door must always be kept shut.
Remember that, both of you.

1366
02:29:03,480 --> 02:29:05,971
Sometimes he sings, even at night.

1367
02:29:06,750 --> 02:29:10,311
It's nothing to worry about.
You'll get used to it.

1368
02:29:12,289 --> 02:29:14,849
This will be your home
for the time being.

1369
02:29:14,959 --> 02:29:16,654
I hope you'll like it.

1370
02:29:16,894 --> 02:29:18,452
Go to bed now.

1371
02:29:19,029 --> 02:29:20,519
Good night, Fanny.

1372
02:29:21,332 --> 02:29:22,822
Good night, Alexander.

1373
02:29:24,134 --> 02:29:27,194
Lock the door at night
and don't open it for anyone.

1374
02:29:28,172 --> 02:29:30,436
Don't forget to say your prayers.
- Don't go.

1375
02:29:32,309 --> 02:29:35,073
You want me to stay?
Then I'll sit here.

1376
02:29:41,919 --> 02:29:43,716
I'll go and see to Ismael.

1377
02:29:48,926 --> 02:29:52,293
My name is Aron.
Ismael is my brother.

1378
02:29:52,396 --> 02:29:54,364
Our parents died
when we were small.

1379
02:30:00,371 --> 02:30:02,236
I have to pee.

1380
02:30:07,478 --> 02:30:09,776
Damn, there's no chamber pot.

1381
02:30:13,017 --> 02:30:15,679
It won't be easy
to find the toilet in the dark.

1382
02:30:28,332 --> 02:30:30,425
I hope there aren't any ghosts.

1383
02:31:17,781 --> 02:31:20,249
Damn, I think I've lost my way.

1384
02:31:49,280 --> 02:31:52,215
Now I'm lost for sure.

1385
02:32:16,540 --> 02:32:19,737
It's not my fault
it's all gone wrong.

1386
02:32:21,345 --> 02:32:24,906
I can't leave you.
I just can't.

1387
02:32:25,015 --> 02:32:27,745
I would be better
if you'd take off for heaven.

1388
02:32:27,851 --> 02:32:29,512
You can't help us anyway.

1389
02:32:42,433 --> 02:32:47,029
I lived my whole life
with you children and Emilie.

1390
02:32:48,472 --> 02:32:50,667
Death makes no difference.

1391
02:32:55,713 --> 02:32:57,943
What is it, Alexander?

1392
02:32:59,483 --> 02:33:03,180
Why can't you go to God
and tell him to kill the bishop?

1393
02:33:05,089 --> 02:33:09,219
Or doesn't God give a damn about you,
or any of us?

1394
02:33:11,061 --> 02:33:14,189
Have you even seen God
on the other side?

1395
02:33:16,033 --> 02:33:19,366
Not a bastard
has a thought in his head.

1396
02:33:21,672 --> 02:33:23,537
Idiots, the whole bunch of 'em.

1397
02:33:30,714 --> 02:33:34,309
You must be gentle with people.

1398
02:33:56,106 --> 02:33:57,937
Aren't you coming to bed?

1399
02:33:59,943 --> 02:34:01,968
The clock has struck 4:00.

1400
02:34:02,179 --> 02:34:03,737
I can't sleep.

1401
02:34:06,683 --> 02:34:08,082
Neither can I.

1402
02:34:08,185 --> 02:34:13,088
Elsa's very sick.
We ought to send for the doctor.

1403
02:34:13,190 --> 02:34:15,158
He's coming in the morning.

1404
02:34:15,259 --> 02:34:17,489
What are you drinking?
- Hot broth.

1405
02:34:17,594 --> 02:34:19,824
It helps against insomnia.
- May I?

1406
02:34:28,305 --> 02:34:29,772
Be my guest.

1407
02:34:30,941 --> 02:34:32,932
Can't you forgive me?

1408
02:34:33,410 --> 02:34:37,369
I'm staying with you, aren't I?

1409
02:34:41,018 --> 02:34:43,486
I don't understand
this sudden yielding.

1410
02:34:43,854 --> 02:34:45,651
Drink while it's hot.

1411
02:34:54,164 --> 02:34:57,224
- You insist that the children return?
- Yes.

1412
02:34:57,334 --> 02:34:59,325
In that case, it's hopeless.

1413
02:34:59,436 --> 02:35:02,701
I don't care if it's hopeless.
I care only for what is right.

1414
02:35:03,907 --> 02:35:05,772
Isn't that Elsa calling?

1415
02:35:09,580 --> 02:35:12,549
Stay here. I'll see to her.

1416
02:35:27,264 --> 02:35:28,925
Can I help you, Aunt?

1417
02:35:29,133 --> 02:35:30,930
It's so dark.

1418
02:35:53,123 --> 02:35:54,920
What time is it?

1419
02:35:56,360 --> 02:35:58,294
Almost half past 4:00.

1420
02:35:58,395 --> 02:35:59,862
It's been a long night.

1421
02:36:00,797 --> 02:36:02,697
Try to get some sleep.

1422
02:36:02,966 --> 02:36:04,797
My legs hurt.

1423
02:36:06,570 --> 02:36:08,367
They're swollen and aching.

1424
02:36:19,082 --> 02:36:24,384
You once said
you were always changing masks...

1425
02:36:26,123 --> 02:36:28,455
until finally
you didn't know who you were.

1426
02:36:32,763 --> 02:36:35,493
I have only one mask.

1427
02:36:36,967 --> 02:36:39,731
But it's branded into my flesh.

1428
02:36:44,508 --> 02:36:46,635
If I tried to tear it off -

1429
02:36:56,987 --> 02:36:59,387
I always thought people liked me.

1430
02:37:02,559 --> 02:37:05,653
I saw myself as wise,
broad-minded and fair.

1431
02:37:07,831 --> 02:37:09,594
I had no idea...

1432
02:37:11,401 --> 02:37:14,199
that anyone could hate me.

1433
02:37:15,072 --> 02:37:16,801
I don't hate you.

1434
02:37:19,042 --> 02:37:21,670
No, but your son does.

1435
02:37:26,250 --> 02:37:27,877
<i>I'm afraid of him.</i>

1436
02:37:50,107 --> 02:37:51,836
Who's behind the door?

1437
02:37:53,010 --> 02:37:55,478
<i>It is God behind the door.</i>

1438
02:37:58,749 --> 02:38:03,516
- Can't you come out?
<i>- No living being may see God's face.</i>

1439
02:38:06,189 --> 02:38:10,216
- What do you want?
<i>- To prove that I exist.</i>

1440
02:38:14,765 --> 02:38:16,164
This is the end of me.

1441
02:38:16,266 --> 02:38:20,293
<i>Shall I show myself?</i>

1442
02:38:20,404 --> 02:38:22,065
<i>Now you will see me.</i>

1443
02:38:23,373 --> 02:38:26,171
<i>Here I come, Alexander.</i>

1444
02:38:48,165 --> 02:38:51,191
- Admit you were scared.
- I wasn't a damned bit scared.

1445
02:38:52,769 --> 02:38:54,600
"This is the end of me."

1446
02:38:58,675 --> 02:39:00,404
Ouch! That hurts.

1447
02:39:01,411 --> 02:39:02,935
Don't cry.

1448
02:39:03,947 --> 02:39:07,644
I didn't mean to scare you.
At least not that much.

1449
02:39:13,623 --> 02:39:16,057
I've been working all night
on this puppet.

1450
02:39:17,661 --> 02:39:21,722
A rich circus owner in England
is mad about our puppets.

1451
02:39:22,432 --> 02:39:24,696
I heard you tiptoeing around.

1452
02:39:27,304 --> 02:39:30,467
Hear that?
My brother Ismael is awake.

1453
02:39:31,408 --> 02:39:32,705
He's singing.

1454
02:39:40,350 --> 02:39:41,817
Poor Ismael.

1455
02:39:42,152 --> 02:39:44,120
Human beings are more
than he can bear.

1456
02:39:44,388 --> 02:39:46,322
Sometimes he gets furious.
Then he's dangerous.

1457
02:39:46,423 --> 02:39:51,520
You said you'd been up all night,
but I saw you asleep.

1458
02:39:51,628 --> 02:39:54,256
There are many strange things
that can't be explained.

1459
02:39:54,998 --> 02:39:57,364
You realize that
when you dabble in magic.

1460
02:39:58,468 --> 02:40:01,198
Have you seen our mummy?
- No.

1461
02:40:02,272 --> 02:40:03,364
Come.

1462
02:40:48,985 --> 02:40:50,919
Look carefully, Alexander.

1463
02:40:52,055 --> 02:40:54,182
Can you see it breathing?

1464
02:40:55,025 --> 02:40:58,688
It's been dead 4,000 years,
but it breathes.

1465
02:41:00,363 --> 02:41:02,388
I'll make the room dark.

1466
02:41:09,339 --> 02:41:11,102
- What do you see?
- It's shining.

1467
02:41:11,741 --> 02:41:13,208
Exactly.

1468
02:41:14,211 --> 02:41:16,679
No one knows why it's luminous.

1469
02:41:17,948 --> 02:41:19,745
No one can explain why.

1470
02:41:22,085 --> 02:41:25,054
The unknown makes people angry.

1471
02:41:25,856 --> 02:41:29,292
It's better to blame it on mirrors,
machines and projections.

1472
02:41:29,726 --> 02:41:31,250
Then people laugh,

1473
02:41:31,595 --> 02:41:35,224
and that's healthier from all viewpoints,
especially financially.

1474
02:41:36,633 --> 02:41:38,191
Watch carefully now.

1475
02:42:00,423 --> 02:42:03,586
Uncle Isak says we're surrounded
by different realities,

1476
02:42:03,693 --> 02:42:05,354
one on top of the other.

1477
02:42:06,162 --> 02:42:08,960
There are swarms
of ghosts, spirits, phantoms,

1478
02:42:09,566 --> 02:42:12,433
souls, poltergeists,
angels and demons.

1479
02:42:14,437 --> 02:42:17,770
He says the smallest pebble
has a life of its own.

1480
02:42:18,475 --> 02:42:20,443
More coffee?
- Yes, please.

1481
02:42:22,178 --> 02:42:23,975
Everything is alive,

1482
02:42:24,614 --> 02:42:26,946
and everything
is God or God's thought.

1483
02:42:27,450 --> 02:42:30,010
Not only good things,
but the cruelest too.

1484
02:42:31,621 --> 02:42:33,248
What do you think?

1485
02:42:34,391 --> 02:42:35,881
If there is a God,

1486
02:42:36,059 --> 02:42:39,256
then he's a shit,
and I'd like to kick him in the butt.

1487
02:42:39,362 --> 02:42:41,762
Your theory is very interesting

1488
02:42:41,865 --> 02:42:44,698
and appears to be justified.

1489
02:42:46,002 --> 02:42:47,993
Shall we take Ismael his breakfast?

1490
02:42:54,177 --> 02:42:56,042
I've brought your breakfast.

1491
02:43:12,128 --> 02:43:15,894
Your sister gave me sleeping pills
for my insomnia.

1492
02:43:17,734 --> 02:43:19,964
I had put three in the broth.

1493
02:43:20,070 --> 02:43:22,971
I didn't mean for you to drink it.

1494
02:43:23,673 --> 02:43:28,133
When you went to see Elsa,
I put in three more.

1495
02:43:31,881 --> 02:43:33,872
You will sleep soundly.

1496
02:43:36,686 --> 02:43:38,745
When you wake up, I will be gone.

1497
02:43:40,457 --> 02:43:42,516
I'm going back to my children...

1498
02:43:44,027 --> 02:43:45,494
to my home...

1499
02:43:47,631 --> 02:43:49,258
and my family.

1500
02:44:11,988 --> 02:44:14,855
I'll change and you'll come back.

1501
02:44:15,325 --> 02:44:17,555
I'll never come back!

1502
02:44:17,661 --> 02:44:19,652
I'll poison your life!

1503
02:44:19,763 --> 02:44:21,458
I'll follow you from town to town!

1504
02:44:21,564 --> 02:44:23,589
I'll ruin your children's future!

1505
02:44:23,700 --> 02:44:26,692
Poor Edvard, you don't know
what you're saying!

1506
02:44:26,803 --> 02:44:28,327
I am awake!

1507
02:44:29,205 --> 02:44:31,264
I'm horribly awake.

1508
02:44:36,112 --> 02:44:38,842
Help me into bed at least.

1509
02:44:40,617 --> 02:44:42,881
I can't see anymore...

1510
02:44:43,953 --> 02:44:45,580
and I feel dizzy.

1511
02:44:49,826 --> 02:44:53,990
Are you there? I can't see.

1512
02:45:00,603 --> 02:45:03,094
Ismael, I've brought your breakfast.

1513
02:45:20,256 --> 02:45:21,883
Good morning, Ismael.

1514
02:45:24,828 --> 02:45:27,854
This is Alexander Ekdahl, a friend.

1515
02:45:29,165 --> 02:45:30,826
Leave us alone, Aron.

1516
02:45:32,602 --> 02:45:35,093
Don't worry. I won't eat him...

1517
02:45:36,306 --> 02:45:38,501
even if he does look appetizing.

1518
02:45:41,444 --> 02:45:43,412
You can come back in half an hour.

1519
02:45:44,581 --> 02:45:46,674
Go now, Aron.
- Uncle Isak -

1520
02:45:46,783 --> 02:45:50,048
Uncle Isak is an old goat
and needn't know of Alexander's visit.

1521
02:45:51,421 --> 02:45:52,752
Go now.

1522
02:46:13,309 --> 02:46:14,674
No, thank you.

1523
02:46:16,513 --> 02:46:19,038
My name is Ismael,
but you already know that.

1524
02:46:22,252 --> 02:46:24,720
"And he will be a wild man.

1525
02:46:25,622 --> 02:46:29,058
His hand will be against every man,

1526
02:46:29,692 --> 02:46:32,320
and every man's hand against him."

1527
02:46:35,298 --> 02:46:38,756
I'm considered dangerous.
That's why I'm locked up.

1528
02:46:38,868 --> 02:46:40,426
Dangerous in what way?

1529
02:46:43,039 --> 02:46:44,666
Write your name here.

1530
02:46:46,509 --> 02:46:49,740
The pencil's pretty dull,
but it should still serve.

1531
02:46:52,682 --> 02:46:56,083
There, Alexander Ekdahl.

1532
02:46:56,653 --> 02:46:58,314
Now read what you've written.

1533
02:47:00,623 --> 02:47:04,115
It says "Ismael Retzinsky."

1534
02:47:10,700 --> 02:47:14,534
Perhaps we're the same person,
with no boundaries.

1535
02:47:15,705 --> 02:47:17,673
Perhaps we flow through each other,

1536
02:47:17,974 --> 02:47:21,501
stream through each other
boundlessly and magnificently.

1537
02:47:25,748 --> 02:47:28,080
You bear such terrible thoughts...

1538
02:47:29,786 --> 02:47:32,482
it's almost painful to be near you.

1539
02:47:35,058 --> 02:47:36,616
Yet it's also enticing.

1540
02:47:38,094 --> 02:47:41,393
Do you know why?
- I don't think I want to know.

1541
02:47:46,669 --> 02:47:50,196
You've heard of making an image
of someone you dislike

1542
02:47:50,306 --> 02:47:52,331
and sticking pins in it?

1543
02:47:54,377 --> 02:47:55,935
It's a rather clumsy method

1544
02:47:56,045 --> 02:47:59,674
when you think of the swift paths
an evil thought can travel.

1545
02:48:05,154 --> 02:48:07,622
You're a strange little person.

1546
02:48:09,592 --> 02:48:13,722
You won't speak of that
which is constantly in your thoughts.

1547
02:48:22,038 --> 02:48:24,268
You're thinking of a man's death.

1548
02:48:25,174 --> 02:48:26,471
Wait a moment.

1549
02:48:27,143 --> 02:48:29,111
I know who you're thinking of:

1550
02:48:34,517 --> 02:48:37,315
a tall man with fair, graying hair.

1551
02:48:37,453 --> 02:48:39,045
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1552
02:48:39,222 --> 02:48:43,249
He has clear blue eyes
and a boyish face.

1553
02:48:43,359 --> 02:48:45,020
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1554
02:48:45,995 --> 02:48:50,125
He's asleep and dreams
he's kneeling at the altar.

1555
02:48:50,900 --> 02:48:53,698
Above the altar
hangs the crucified prophet.

1556
02:48:54,904 --> 02:48:57,099
In his dream he gets up
and cries out,

1557
02:48:58,241 --> 02:49:02,701
"My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me?"

1558
02:49:04,714 --> 02:49:06,579
There is no answer,

1559
02:49:06,950 --> 02:49:08,577
not even a laugh.

1560
02:49:09,052 --> 02:49:11,043
Don't talk like that.

1561
02:49:11,955 --> 02:49:13,547
It is not I talking.

1562
02:49:15,558 --> 02:49:17,082
<i>It is yourself.</i>

1563
02:49:21,464 --> 02:49:23,227
You are not to hesitate.

1564
02:49:26,202 --> 02:49:30,798
He's sound asleep,
plagued by nightmares.

1565
02:49:33,576 --> 02:49:35,476
Give me your hands.

1566
02:49:36,446 --> 02:49:40,109
It isn't really necessary,
but it's safer.

1567
02:49:43,886 --> 02:49:45,854
The doors will be thrown open.

1568
02:49:46,122 --> 02:49:48,488
<i>A scream will echo through the house.</i>

1569
02:49:49,359 --> 02:49:51,520
<i>- I don't want to.</i>
<i>- It's too late.</i>

1570
02:49:52,628 --> 02:49:55,597
You have only one way to go,
and I am with you.

1571
02:49:56,099 --> 02:49:58,033
I obliterate myself.

1572
02:49:58,267 --> 02:50:00,258
I merge into you, my child.

1573
02:50:00,536 --> 02:50:02,834
Don't be afraid.
I am with you.

1574
02:50:02,906 --> 02:50:05,033
I'm your guardian angel.

1575
02:50:09,145 --> 02:50:12,706
It is 5:00 in the morning,
and the sun has just risen.

1576
02:50:13,516 --> 02:50:15,313
The doors are thrown open.

1577
02:50:15,852 --> 02:50:17,410
No, wait.

1578
02:50:17,754 --> 02:50:22,589
First a horrible scream
echoes through the house.

1579
02:50:23,993 --> 02:50:28,487
A shapeless burning figure
moves across the floor,

1580
02:50:29,065 --> 02:50:30,157
<i>screaming.</i>

1581
02:50:30,266 --> 02:50:31,563
<i>I don't want to.</i>

1582
02:50:31,668 --> 02:50:33,659
<i>Let me go! Let me go!</i>

1583
02:51:12,442 --> 02:51:15,775
The police are here
and insist on speaking to you.

1584
02:51:27,824 --> 02:51:29,121
<i>Your husband,</i>

1585
02:51:29,892 --> 02:51:31,519
His Grace the bishop,

1586
02:51:32,261 --> 02:51:36,925
lost his life this morning
under terrible circumstances.

1587
02:51:39,369 --> 02:51:40,836
May I, madam?

1588
02:51:44,073 --> 02:51:47,668
We think we've been able to determine
the course of events.

1589
02:51:49,212 --> 02:51:52,978
Miss Elsa Bergius,
who was gravely ill, lay in bed.

1590
02:51:53,282 --> 02:51:55,682
On her bedside table stood a lamp.

1591
02:51:56,119 --> 02:51:58,610
By some unfortunate accident,
the lamp fell on the bed

1592
02:51:58,721 --> 02:52:03,317
igniting her nightgown,
hair and bed linens.

1593
02:52:03,426 --> 02:52:07,590
Blazing like a torch,
she ran through the house

1594
02:52:07,797 --> 02:52:12,564
and by chance made it
into the bishop's bedchamber.

1595
02:52:14,771 --> 02:52:20,107
According to His Grace's sister,
Miss Henrietta Vergerus,

1596
02:52:20,643 --> 02:52:24,170
he was in a heavy sleep

1597
02:52:24,280 --> 02:52:25,713
from a soporific

1598
02:52:26,082 --> 02:52:30,178
you had given him earlier that night.

1599
02:52:30,286 --> 02:52:33,016
Miss Bergius flung herself on him,

1600
02:52:33,122 --> 02:52:36,148
igniting his bedclothes
and nightshirt.

1601
02:52:36,592 --> 02:52:38,822
His Grace woke up
and succeeded in freeing himself

1602
02:52:38,928 --> 02:52:41,453
from the dying woman
who was still ablaze.

1603
02:52:43,299 --> 02:52:46,757
But he could not
extinguish the flames

1604
02:52:47,403 --> 02:52:49,064
that were now engulfing him.

1605
02:52:50,807 --> 02:52:54,299
Old Mrs. Vergerus found her son

1606
02:52:55,011 --> 02:52:58,777
with his body burnt
and face charred.

1607
02:53:00,483 --> 02:53:05,318
He showed faint signs of life
and said he was in unbearable agony.

1608
02:53:08,224 --> 02:53:11,660
Although I can't overlook the fact

1609
02:53:11,761 --> 02:53:16,994
that the sleeping aid you gave him
possibly made the disaster worse,

1610
02:53:17,100 --> 02:53:20,467
I also cannot attach
any serious importance to it.

1611
02:53:20,770 --> 02:53:24,536
Therefore, I must characterize the event
as an ill-fated coincidence

1612
02:53:24,640 --> 02:53:28,167
of extremely unfortunate
circumstances.

1613
02:53:55,538 --> 02:54:00,237
My dear, dear friends.

1614
02:54:02,578 --> 02:54:05,069
I am more moved than I can say.

1615
02:54:11,554 --> 02:54:14,580
My wisdom is simple.

1616
02:54:15,491 --> 02:54:19,723
There are those who despise it,
but I don't give a damn -

1617
02:54:20,229 --> 02:54:22,959
Forgive me, Mama.
I noticed you raised your right eyebrow.

1618
02:54:23,065 --> 02:54:26,296
You think your son is talking too much.
Don't worry. I will be brief.

1619
02:54:26,636 --> 02:54:29,833
Therefore... and consequently...

1620
02:54:32,241 --> 02:54:36,473
we Ekdahls have not come
into the world to see through it.

1621
02:54:36,579 --> 02:54:37,705
Never think that.

1622
02:54:38,514 --> 02:54:43,645
We are not equipped
for such excursions.

1623
02:54:44,420 --> 02:54:48,288
We might just as well ignore
the big things.

1624
02:54:49,692 --> 02:54:55,289
We must live in the little world.

1625
02:54:57,333 --> 02:54:59,392
We will be content with that

1626
02:55:00,303 --> 02:55:04,399
and cultivate it
and make the best of it.

1627
02:55:08,511 --> 02:55:10,172
Suddenly death strikes.

1628
02:55:11,948 --> 02:55:15,714
Suddenly the abyss opens.

1629
02:55:17,320 --> 02:55:20,653
Suddenly the storm howls,
and disaster is upon us.

1630
02:55:21,224 --> 02:55:23,089
All that we know.

1631
02:55:23,726 --> 02:55:27,389
But let us not think
of all that unpleasantness.

1632
02:55:27,830 --> 02:55:30,822
We Ekdahls love our subterfuges.

1633
02:55:31,467 --> 02:55:37,133
Rob a man of his subterfuges
and he goes mad and begins lashing out.

1634
02:55:37,240 --> 02:55:41,438
Damn it all,
people must be intelligible!

1635
02:55:43,112 --> 02:55:46,343
Otherwise we don't dare to love them
or speak ill of them.

1636
02:55:47,450 --> 02:55:51,750
We must be able to grasp
the world and reality

1637
02:55:52,455 --> 02:55:57,188
so we can complain of their monotony
with a clear conscience.

1638
02:55:58,894 --> 02:56:03,854
Don't be sad, dear splendid artists.

1639
02:56:05,735 --> 02:56:10,695
Actors and actresses,
we need you all the same.

1640
02:56:11,641 --> 02:56:16,874
It is you who must give us
our supernatural shivers,

1641
02:56:17,680 --> 02:56:21,047
or better yet,
our innermost diversions.

1642
02:56:25,087 --> 02:56:29,285
The world is a den of thieves
and night is falling.

1643
02:56:31,427 --> 02:56:35,124
Evil breaks its chains
and runs through the world like a mad dog.

1644
02:56:37,333 --> 02:56:39,301
The poison affects us all,

1645
02:56:39,969 --> 02:56:42,733
us Ekdahls and everyone else.

1646
02:56:42,838 --> 02:56:44,533
No one escapes,

1647
02:56:45,741 --> 02:56:51,441
not even Helena Viktoria
or little Aurora.

1648
02:56:54,650 --> 02:56:56,242
So it shall be.

1649
02:56:58,454 --> 02:57:03,915
Therefore let us be happy
while we are happy.

1650
02:57:05,127 --> 02:57:09,530
Let us be kind, generous,
affectionate and good.

1651
02:57:10,800 --> 02:57:14,759
It is necessary,
and not at all shameful...

1652
02:57:16,172 --> 02:57:19,903
to take pleasure in the little world.

1653
02:57:21,977 --> 02:57:23,638
Good food...

1654
02:57:24,647 --> 02:57:26,672
gentle smiles...

1655
02:57:28,317 --> 02:57:32,617
fruit trees in bloom, waltzes.

1656
02:57:33,622 --> 02:57:38,821
My dearest friends,
I'm done talking,

1657
02:57:38,928 --> 02:57:40,953
and you can take it as you like:

1658
02:57:41,063 --> 02:57:45,659
The sentimental ramblings
of an uneducated restaurateur

1659
02:57:45,768 --> 02:57:48,168
or the pitiful babbling of an old man.

1660
02:57:48,270 --> 02:57:50,261
I don't care.

1661
02:58:04,987 --> 02:58:08,115
I hold a little empress in my arms.

1662
02:58:11,293 --> 02:58:15,696
It's tangible yet immeasurable.

1663
02:58:18,267 --> 02:58:22,033
One day she will prove
everything I just said wrong.

1664
02:58:23,439 --> 02:58:26,875
One day she will not only rule
the little world,

1665
02:58:27,843 --> 02:58:29,834
but everything.

1666
02:58:31,380 --> 02:58:32,938
Everything.

1667
02:58:39,321 --> 02:58:41,050
There, there, my child.

1668
02:58:41,157 --> 02:58:44,320
Be a good girl now,
so that Mama can go to bed.

1669
02:58:45,428 --> 02:58:47,919
I think you've finished eating,
in any case.

1670
02:58:48,264 --> 02:58:51,062
- I'll take her.
- Thank you, Rosa.

1671
02:58:54,270 --> 02:58:56,761
- How do you like it here?
- Everyone's so kind.

1672
02:58:57,339 --> 02:58:59,273
Especially Mr. Ekdahl.

1673
02:58:59,608 --> 02:59:01,542
He must be a real friend of humanity.

1674
02:59:01,744 --> 02:59:03,678
That he certainly is.

1675
02:59:03,913 --> 02:59:08,043
He's particularly kind to young girls,
so you watch out, Rosa.

1676
02:59:08,150 --> 02:59:09,708
Oh, my!

1677
02:59:15,057 --> 02:59:16,991
- Good night, madam.
- Good night, Rosa.

1678
02:59:18,861 --> 02:59:20,522
<i>Come along, you're tired.</i>

1679
02:59:20,629 --> 02:59:24,030
<i>I'm wide awake.</i>
<i>We're going to have champagne.</i>

1680
02:59:24,133 --> 02:59:26,397
<i>Oh, no, we're not.</i>
<i>We're going to bed.</i>

1681
02:59:26,502 --> 02:59:28,265
We're going to have champagne.

1682
02:59:28,370 --> 02:59:32,306
If you're a good boy, I'll bring you
a beer and sandwich in bed.

1683
02:59:37,046 --> 02:59:40,311
I'm sure Emilie will want
a glass of champagne.

1684
02:59:40,416 --> 02:59:43,681
We'll raise a toast to our daughters.

1685
02:59:44,119 --> 02:59:46,019
Go to bed now, Gusten.

1686
02:59:46,121 --> 02:59:49,579
I'm so damned happy!

1687
02:59:51,393 --> 02:59:54,988
That's nice, Gusten,
but you'll have a headache tomorrow.

1688
02:59:55,364 --> 02:59:58,231
Imagine: We're together again.

1689
03:00:04,406 --> 03:00:07,807
I'm going to the country tomorrow
to speak with the workmen.

1690
03:00:08,143 --> 03:00:09,872
Do you need anything taken care of?

1691
03:00:09,979 --> 03:00:12,971
I'll be there until Thursday.
- I'll come on Tuesday.

1692
03:00:13,082 --> 03:00:16,916
Don't you think I have
the best wife in the world?

1693
03:00:17,019 --> 03:00:19,010
Much better than you deserve.

1694
03:00:20,556 --> 03:00:23,719
And the world's
prettiest little mistress.

1695
03:00:23,959 --> 03:00:26,393
A real darling.

1696
03:00:27,062 --> 03:00:29,292
- Are you going in the morning?
- Not until 2:00.

1697
03:00:31,834 --> 03:00:36,771
When I see you,
I want to weep with joy.

1698
03:00:36,872 --> 03:00:40,569
To think you're back with us again!

1699
03:00:43,612 --> 03:00:46,080
- Good night, Gusten.
- Good night.

1700
03:00:46,849 --> 03:00:49,647
Be a good boy now, and remember
that Alma needs her sleep.

1701
03:00:52,721 --> 03:00:55,519
I know what Alma needs.

1702
03:01:23,218 --> 03:01:24,412
Aunt Emilie.

1703
03:01:24,920 --> 03:01:28,947
- What do you two want at this hour?
- We want to move to Stockholm.

1704
03:01:29,058 --> 03:01:32,653
Marianne Egerman is opening
a boutique and wants us to help.

1705
03:01:33,028 --> 03:01:35,792
- And we'd like to.
- We'd very much like to.

1706
03:01:37,266 --> 03:01:39,131
But we have a big problem.

1707
03:01:39,234 --> 03:01:41,794
Papa insists on that caf� for Maj.

1708
03:01:41,904 --> 03:01:43,496
He's so kind.

1709
03:01:45,507 --> 03:01:49,307
- Maj's had enough of his tutelage.
- He's so kind.

1710
03:01:49,411 --> 03:01:53,142
She wants to live her own life
and decide for herself and her baby.

1711
03:01:53,482 --> 03:01:55,347
I don't know what to do.

1712
03:01:55,451 --> 03:01:56,975
We've spoken to Mama.

1713
03:01:57,186 --> 03:02:00,815
She was awfully upset at first
and said we couldn't do that to Papa.

1714
03:02:01,357 --> 03:02:05,623
Then she calmed down and said
that life must take its course...

1715
03:02:06,695 --> 03:02:09,095
and that one shouldn't force
one's children.

1716
03:02:09,732 --> 03:02:11,962
Though she felt sorry
for Papa's sake.

1717
03:02:13,168 --> 03:02:14,965
It's awful.

1718
03:02:15,070 --> 03:02:17,197
You must think of yourself.

1719
03:02:17,740 --> 03:02:21,335
After all, Papa's an old man.
Isn't that true, Aunt Emilie?

1720
03:02:21,777 --> 03:02:24,245
Go to bed now.
I'll have a word with Grandmama.

1721
03:03:12,528 --> 03:03:15,361
Emilie, how nice to see you!
Welcome!

1722
03:03:15,631 --> 03:03:17,326
I need to speak with you.

1723
03:03:17,466 --> 03:03:19,434
- Would you like a cognac?
- No, thank you.

1724
03:03:19,535 --> 03:03:21,196
Is it anything serious?

1725
03:03:21,637 --> 03:03:24,902
Oh, yes. Maj and Petra
want to move to Stockholm.

1726
03:03:25,607 --> 03:03:26,904
What do you think?

1727
03:03:52,901 --> 03:03:54,732
You can't escape me.

1728
03:04:00,743 --> 03:04:02,267
One other thing.

1729
03:04:02,377 --> 03:04:04,368
You're right.

1730
03:04:04,847 --> 03:04:08,476
On his deathbed, Oscar asked you
to take charge of the theater.

1731
03:04:09,284 --> 03:04:11,445
I was there.
I remember it well.

1732
03:04:11,820 --> 03:04:13,685
Gustav Adolf will be awfully hurt.

1733
03:04:13,889 --> 03:04:16,858
Why all this concern
for Gustav Adolf?

1734
03:04:17,760 --> 03:04:19,728
He has a good head for business,

1735
03:04:19,928 --> 03:04:22,761
but he doesn't know
a thing about theater.

1736
03:04:23,265 --> 03:04:25,495
It's your theater, my dear Emilie.

1737
03:04:27,102 --> 03:04:29,627
It's about time we explain
to our backwoods Napoleon

1738
03:04:29,805 --> 03:04:31,568
that he's facing his Waterloo.

1739
03:04:32,741 --> 03:04:36,142
I'd like you to read a new play
by August Strindberg.

1740
03:04:37,012 --> 03:04:39,344
That nasty misogynist!

1741
03:04:39,581 --> 03:04:40,605
No, thank you.

1742
03:04:40,716 --> 03:04:42,684
It's called <i>A Dream Play.</i>

1743
03:04:44,720 --> 03:04:46,779
I thought we'd both perform in it.

1744
03:04:47,623 --> 03:04:50,421
Not on your life.
I haven't appeared on stage in -

1745
03:04:50,526 --> 03:04:54,394
All the more reason.
I won't disturb you any longer.

1746
03:04:55,464 --> 03:04:58,262
You never disturb me.

1747
03:05:04,339 --> 03:05:06,273
What are you laughing at?

1748
03:05:06,575 --> 03:05:09,169
Now we're the ones in charge,
aren't we?

1749
03:05:09,611 --> 03:05:10,771
Do you think so?

1750
03:05:12,881 --> 03:05:15,941
- Good night, dearest.
- Good night, my dear.

1751
03:05:57,960 --> 03:06:03,626
"Everything can happen.
Everything is possible and probable.

1752
03:06:04,433 --> 03:06:07,231
Time and space do not exist.

1753
03:06:07,870 --> 03:06:11,169
On a flimsy framework of reality,

1754
03:06:11,740 --> 03:06:17,042
the imagination spins,
weaving new patterns."
