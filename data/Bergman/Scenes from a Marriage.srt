

2
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:39,374
- This room will be ideal for pictures.
- Sit here on the sofa.

3
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:42,127
Everybody look at the camera.

4
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,296
Nice, isn't it?
Let's see some happy faces.

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,840
INNOCENCE AND PANIC

6
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:48,842
Smile. You too, Mom.

7
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:52,387
Watch the hair!

8
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:54,431
That's the shot.

9
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:57,976
- Are we done?
- I think so.

10
00:00:58,059 --> 00:00:59,352
The girls can go, at any rate.

11
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:02,439
- Good job, girls.
- Go have your sandwiches.

12
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:05,108
Good as gold. Bye-bye.

13
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:08,153
How about some shots
of the husband and wife on the sofa?

14
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:11,865
Sure. Move forward.

15
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:13,867
Don't slouch down.

16
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:18,163
- I'll make myself look smaller.
- Make it a close-up.

17
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:19,998
Talk to each other.

18
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:25,837
- Marianne, turn your gaze a bit.
- Look as if you're fond of each other.

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,089
Now smile at each other.

20
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:30,258
Hold it. That's great.

21
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:32,802
I got my shot, thank you.

22
00:01:32,886 --> 00:01:36,222
Take a few portraits too.

23
00:01:36,306 --> 00:01:41,519
Well, let's get cracking.
I generally use a standard opener

24
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,480
to put people at ease.

25
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:46,232
- I'm not particularly nervous.
- All the better.

26
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:52,489
So, how would you describe
yourselves in a few words?

27
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:57,243
- That's tricky.
- Is it?

28
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:59,871
- I might give the wrong impression.
- You think so?

29
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:03,708
It sounds cocky if I say I'm bright,

30
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,878
youthful, successful and sexy.

31
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:12,383
My mind has a global scope,
I'm educated, and a I'm a great mixer.

32
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,511
What else?

33
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:18,848
I'm a good friend,
even to those less fortunate than myself.

34
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:23,812
I'm sporty, and I'm a good father
and a good son.

35
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:27,232
I don't have any debts,
and I pay my taxes.

36
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:30,568
I respect our government,
no matter what.

37
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:34,823
I love our royal family.
I don't belong to the state church.

38
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:37,325
Is that good,
or do you want more details?

39
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:40,245
I'm a fantastic lover.
Isn't that right, Marianne?

40
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:43,915
Maybe we should skip that question.
Your turn, Marianne.

41
00:02:46,543 --> 00:02:49,170
What can I say?

42
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:54,217
I'm married to Johan
and we have two daughters.

43
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:59,639
- I can't think of anything else.
- Sure you can.

44
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:06,855
- I think Johan is very nice.
- How kind of you.

45
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:12,360
- We've been married for ten years.
- Yes, I just renewed the contract.

46
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:18,783
I lack Johan's
boundless self-assurance,

47
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:23,204
but in all honesty,
I'm happy I lead the life I do.

48
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:26,624
It's a good life,
if you know what I mean.

49
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,796
What else should I say?
This is difficult.

50
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,426
- She has a great figure.
- I'm trying to take this seriously.

51
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:42,265
- I have two girls, Karin and Eva.
- You said that already.

52
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:46,686
Let's move on to the particulars.
How old are you?

53
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,231
- I'm 42, but it doesn't show.
- I'm 35.

54
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:54,861
We come from ridiculously
bourgeois backgrounds.

55
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:57,030
Johan's father is a physician.

56
00:03:57,113 --> 00:04:00,992
My mother is very much the mother.

57
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,286
My father is a lawyer.

58
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:06,706
It was decided early on
that I would become one too.

59
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,417
I'm the youngest of seven children.

60
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:12,211
My mother ran a large household.

61
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,256
- Nowadays she takes things easier.
- Oh, really?

62
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:20,053
Oddly enough, we enjoy
the company of our parents.

63
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:24,474
We see each other often,
and we rarely clash.

64
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,686
Maybe we should talk
about your professions.

65
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:35,735
I'm an associate professor
at the Psychotechnology Institute.

66
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:38,696
My field is family law.

67
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,242
I belong to a large law firm
and deal mostly with divorce.

68
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:45,161
The interesting thing about my job is...

69
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:46,829
Don't move! Hold that pose.

70
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:49,123
Take a picture and get that look.

71
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:51,459
Good. Great.

72
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,881
- Oh, that makes me feel...
- You'll get used to it.

73
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:59,801
How did you meet?

74
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:02,845
I'll leave that to Johan.

75
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:04,931
Now, that's an interesting tale.

76
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:07,892
It wasn't love at first sight.

77
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:14,732
Both of us socialized quite a lot,
and we often ran into each other.

78
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:18,569
For many years we were
heavily involved in political causes

79
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:21,322
and belonged
to a drama group at school.

80
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:27,996
We weren't particularly
interested in each other.

81
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,831
I guess Marianne
thought I was conceited.

82
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:34,168
At the time, Johan was in a highly
publicized romance with a pop singer.

83
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:39,048
It gave him a certain image,
and he was cocky.

84
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:45,513
At 19, Marianne was married to a boy
whose only virtue was a rich father.

85
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:49,851
He was very kind,
and I was crazy about him.

86
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:54,147
I also got pregnant.

87
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,358
- But how did you...
- Get together?

88
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:01,112
Basically, it was Marianne's idea.

89
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:08,578
My baby died soon after it was born,
and my husband and I split up.

90
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:12,832
Johan's singer had given him
his walking papers.

91
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:16,461
Both of us were shaken,

92
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,005
so I suggested
we start seeing each other.

93
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:24,260
We weren't in love,
but both of us were unhappy.

94
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:30,183
We realized
that we got along famously,

95
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:33,102
and our grades improved.

96
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:36,105
So we decided to live together.

97
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:41,152
We expected our mothers to be shocked,
but they weren't.

98
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,072
They became fast friends.

99
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:48,826
We were accepted as a couple

100
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,871
and got married six months later.

101
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:55,708
- By that time we were in love.
- Madly in love.

102
00:06:56,417 --> 00:07:00,838
- People saw us as the perfect couple.
- And it's been that way ever since.

103
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:02,715
Without any hitches?

104
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:06,636
Our material needs are met.

105
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:11,849
We get on well
with all our friends and relations.

106
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:15,812
We have good jobs that we enjoy.
We're in good health.

107
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:18,147
And so on and so forth,
to an almost embarrassing degree.

108
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:21,901
Security, order,
contentment, loyalty.

109
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:25,488
We're indecently fortunate.

110
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:33,037
We do have our disagreements,
but basically we get along well.

111
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:35,790
- Don't you ever quarrel?
- Marianne quarrels.

112
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:40,795
Johan is so slow to anger
that it takes the wind out of my sails.

113
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:43,297
That all sounds fabulous.

114
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,177
I heard someone say just last night

115
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:52,515
that the very lack of problems
could cause strife.

116
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:57,061
We're well aware
of the hazards of a life like ours.

117
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,814
Hazards? How do you mean?

118
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:05,820
The world is going to the dogs,
and I prefer to live and let live.

119
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:08,698
I'm entitled to simply
look out for number one.

120
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:12,326
It makes me sick
to hear about the latest panacea.

121
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:17,206
- I don't feel the same way as Johan.
- How do you feel?

122
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:23,254
I believe... in compassion.

123
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,214
Could you please expand on that?

124
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:31,596
If we all learned to care
about our fellow man from childhood,

125
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:34,390
the world would be different.

126
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:38,311
Hold that pose.
Look into the camera.

127
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:43,983
Listen to this:

128
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:49,739
"Marianne's eyes are as blue as a folk song
and are lit up from within.

129
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:55,661
When I ask her how she copes with it all,
she smiles in shy delight

130
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,458
and replies that
she and Johan both pitch in."

131
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,251
Which happens to be true.

132
00:09:02,335 --> 00:09:04,962
"'We understand each other, '
she replies,

133
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:09,217
brightening as Johan sits down next to her
on the heirloom sofa.

134
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,263
Protectively, he puts his arm around her,
eliciting a smile."

135
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:18,267
- Hey!
- Here comes the best bit.

136
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:23,231
"As I take my leave, I notice how
they secretly appreciate that fact

137
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:25,775
so they can bask in each other's
presence once more.

138
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:32,823
Two souls who have matured together
sharing a positive outlook,

139
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:37,995
yet never forgetting
to put love in the forefront."

140
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:41,624
We were mortified when we read it.

141
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:47,129
I considered taking action,
but our mothers adored the piece.

142
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:51,175
One thing gets me:
My eyes didn't get a mention.

143
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:54,512
Don't they shine with a secret light?

144
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:58,599
They're more like dark pools.
The effect is quite sexy.

145
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:02,561
Katarina has a crush on you.

146
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:07,400
- How about running off with me?
- A change would do Johan good.

147
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:11,904
He's lived a married life for ten years,
and he's never strayed.

148
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:13,864
Are you sure?

149
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:18,619
Certainly. From the get-go I decided
to believe everything Johan tells me.

150
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:20,204
Did you hear that, Katarina?

151
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:24,625
Well, I bet Johan is a better liar than you,
my silly little darling.

152
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:26,544
I'm afraid I have
a limited imagination.

153
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,629
That's just it.

154
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:31,132
Less imagination
makes for better liars.

155
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:34,927
Peter embroiders his tales too much.

156
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:36,721
It's almost touching.

157
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:43,185
I read your piece in <i>Technical Times.</i>
Even I could understand it.

158
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:47,440
- Actually, Katarina wrote it.
- Are you really that clever?

159
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:52,945
I was in Germany,
and they wanted an article on the spot.

160
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:56,240
So Katarina whipped one up
and read it to me over the phone.

161
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:58,826
Why does it have your byline?

162
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,871
It's not discrimination or anything.

163
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,706
We generally collaborate.

164
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,750
That's admirable.

165
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,627
Not if you consider
how badly we get along.

166
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:11,339
Frankly, things are hell.

167
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:12,965
Cheers, honey!

168
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:14,550
Cheers.

169
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,393
But surely I can tell Johan and Marianne
how things are?

170
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,031
- What's wrong, Katarina?
- Nothing.

171
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,993
Peter can be such a clod.
That's all.

172
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,496
I'm a clod, all right.

173
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:48,542
I'm proud to be a clod
and to have an imagination.

174
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:54,882
The odd thing is that
Katarina thinks I'm a spineless jellyfish.

175
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,426
Oh, my!

176
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,389
Let's try to have a pleasant time
and not get into life's injustices.

177
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:05,184
That's why we shouldn't forget...

178
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:07,311
It's time for a little speech,

179
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:11,482
with reference to that blessed article
on the two of you.

180
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:16,612
Let's not forget that we are
in the presence of a happy home

181
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:24,120
that shouldn't be soiled
with our emotional crap.

182
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,166
Cheers, Marianne.
The meal was lovely.

183
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,044
I may not envy your domestic bliss,

184
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:36,799
but I do admire
your culinary talents.

185
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,634
I mean it.

186
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:43,889
I really wish Katarina
could pick up a few pointers.

187
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:47,143
Katarina's a much better cook.

188
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:49,145
Peter thinks I poison his food.

189
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:52,148
It's a running joke at our house.

190
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:54,650
It was clear it was a joke, right?

191
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:58,404
One that's hard to digest.

192
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:03,451
Let's have some coffee
in the living room.

193
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:07,830
What should I do now?

194
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,249
I seem to have put my foot
in my mouth again.

195
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:14,420
The girls will clear the table.

196
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:25,222
It's pretty damn touching.

197
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:27,725
What is?

198
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:31,061
Your marriage.

199
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:33,731
Johan and Marianne.

200
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,775
It's so touching,
it brings tears to your eyes.

201
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,072
It makes one itch to puncture
that beautiful balloon of yours.

202
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,783
You would do that?

203
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,744
Cheers.

204
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:51,540
You've been married for ten years.

205
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,627
We just celebrated
our tenth anniversary.

206
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,296
- No skeletons in the closet?
- You never know.

207
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,506
No, you never know.

208
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:02,176
Both Johan and I enjoy cleaning up.

209
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,678
Well, what do you know!

210
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:07,681
That's where we've been remiss:

211
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,725
the cleaning.

212
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,604
But that's going to change.

213
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:18,817
Next week I'll call Marianne
and have her arrange for our divorce.

214
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:25,366
Unfortunately, Peter will back down again
before he sobers up.

215
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:29,161
The adding machine
will start running, you see.

216
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:33,666
It will say,
"I'll go through with a divorce

217
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:36,752
if Katarina relinquishes
any claim on our Swiss assets."

218
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:42,049
To which I counter,
"It's my money. I earned it."

219
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,678
Then Peter will say, "I made it grow.

220
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,389
You can have the factory."

221
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:52,351
And I say, "Great.

222
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:58,399
A factory in Italy
with steadily rising labor costs."

223
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,067
Katarina, please...

224
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,195
"Take everything in Sweden.

225
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:09,034
The apartment, the summer cottage,
the boat, the stocks and bonds."

226
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:11,912
And then I say,
"Damned nice of you

227
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:14,873
to leave me with the taxable assets."

228
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,796
Excuse me for putting
a damper on the evening

229
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,548
with such trivial matters.

230
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:25,509
But when Peter talks about splitting up,

231
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:27,720
then I know how drunk he is...

232
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,514
and that insults are soon to follow.

233
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:32,600
It's like I always say:

234
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,561
Katarina is a businessman.

235
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:39,273
With equal emphasis
on both parts of the word.

236
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,942
Business... man.

237
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:47,156
She's also a brilliant artist.

238
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:52,286
And she has an IQ of I don't know what.

239
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,997
And she's attractive too.

240
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:59,918
A real gem in a stunning package.

241
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:05,633
How such a paragon could ever
spread her legs for me is a mystery.

242
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:09,637
I think it's time
to call a cab and go home.

243
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:13,974
It can't be pleasant for Johan and Marianne
to witness a scene like this.

244
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:16,393
Johan and Marianne!

245
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:18,395
They're candy figurines
wrapped in red ribbons,

246
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:22,191
like the gift-wrapped marzipan pigs
of our childhood.

247
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:28,864
It'll do their souls good

248
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:33,702
to catch a glimpse of the depths of hell.

249
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:46,882
August Strindberg once said,

250
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:52,096
"Could there be anything more terrifying

251
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:56,350
than a husband and wife
who hate each other?"

252
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,022
What do you say?
Child abuse could possibly be worse.

253
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:07,903
But then again,
Katarina and I are children.

254
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,782
Deep down,

255
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,784
Katarina is a little girl who cries

256
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:20,040
because no one comforts her
when she falls.

257
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:25,379
And in the opposite corner,
I'm a little boy

258
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:30,509
who cries because Katarina can't love me.

259
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,887
Even though I'm bad and mean to her.

260
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:37,558
Well, on the bright side,

261
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:42,062
there can't possibly
be anything worse than this.

262
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:44,732
That's why I think we're ready for a divorce.

263
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,944
Only if you're sensible.

264
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:52,531
Only if the two of us simultaneously,

265
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:57,077
and in the presence of witnesses,

266
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:58,871
sign all the papers.

267
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:04,126
So neither of us can cheat the other.

268
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,919
We'll call you sometime this week.

269
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:08,672
We have a fine business lawyer.

270
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:12,176
Mr. Borglund can help you
with the business end.

271
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,927
What do you say, Katarina?

272
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,930
Even if our finances are resolved,

273
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,682
you'll never let me go.

274
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:20,934
I know that.

275
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:26,106
So you think you're so bloody irreplaceable,

276
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,108
my dear Katarina?

277
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,738
Just when did this occur to you?
That would be interesting to know.

278
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:36,074
Couldn't you tell me? Tell us?

279
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,952
You force me to have sex with you,

280
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:41,038
since you can't get it up with anyone else.

281
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,963
You have an insatiable need for guilt.

282
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,596
Now that it's over between you and Jan,
you feel desperate.

283
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:01,016
Now Peter's the only one who cares

284
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,311
and has the proper patience.

285
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,274
So you think you're the only one?

286
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:12,236
Isn't that touching?

287
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:18,367
You think I don't have anyone else.
Let me tell you something, Peter.

288
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,537
Forgive me for being so frank,

289
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,997
but Peter's challenging the truth,

290
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:25,999
and he needs to be enlightened.

291
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:30,087
I want you to know this:

292
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:34,299
I find you utterly repulsive.

293
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,803
In a physical sense, I mean.

294
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:43,642
I could buy a lay from anyone
just to wash you out of my genitals.

295
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:49,273
"Abide with me!
Fast falls the eventide;

296
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:54,611
The darkness deepens;
Lord, with me abide."

297
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,947
You son of a bitch!

298
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,950
"When other helpers fail

299
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,953
and comforts flee,

300
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:06,748
help of the helpless,

301
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,252
oh, abide with me."

302
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,671
Whatever that's supposed to mean.

303
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:37,070
I hope that won't stain the carpet.

304
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:39,573
I'm not sure about liqueurs.

305
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:42,034
- Send me the bill.
- No.

306
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:43,327
Do it!

307
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,961
Could you please
pour me a cup of coffee? I'm...

308
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,548
I'm pretty drunk.

309
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,135
Please forgive us.

310
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:04,306
We don't usually behave like this.

311
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:07,017
But you're our best friends.

312
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,732
Our only friends.

313
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,986
Forgive me.

314
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,198
Forgive us.

315
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:28,330
Call me a cab.

316
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:31,208
I'll take my bacchante home,

317
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,086
and we'll finish our little scene.

318
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:38,382
The finale is generally inappropriate
for an audience.

319
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,012
- What time is it?
- Ten past 12:00.

320
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:48,183
- I'm glad we got rid of them.
- Yes, things got a bit too festive.

321
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:53,438
Do you believe two people
can spend a lifetime together?

322
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:56,942
It's a ridiculous convention
passed down from God knows where.

323
00:21:57,025 --> 00:22:01,947
A five-year contract would be ideal.
Or an agreement subject to renewal.

324
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,950
- Would that apply to us too?
- No.

325
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:08,120
- Why not?
- We're the exception that proves the rule.

326
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:12,290
So you think we'll stay together?

327
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,042
Now, that's a strange question.

328
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:17,295
Doesn't it bother you
to never get to sleep with anyone else?

329
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,423
- No. Does it bother you?
- Sometimes.

330
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:20,799
I'll be damned.

331
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:23,135
On a purely theoretical plane.

332
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:25,387
I wonder if something's wrong with me.

333
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,391
I don't have fantasies like that.
I'm content.

334
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:30,892
Well, so am I.

335
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,478
Oh, now I get it.

336
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:38,608
I know why Katarina and Peter
go through hell.

337
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:41,194
They don't speak the same language.

338
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:45,490
They have to translate everything
into a common language.

339
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:47,534
I think it's simpler than that.

340
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:51,288
You and I understand each other.

341
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:55,208
We speak the same language.
That's what makes us click.

342
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,960
I think it's the money.

343
00:22:57,044 --> 00:23:00,088
If you speak the same language
and trust each other,

344
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:01,673
money is not a problem.

345
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:03,675
You and your languages.

346
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,054
I see it at work all the time.

347
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,347
Sometimes it's like husband and wife

348
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:12,893
are talking on telephones
that are out of order.

349
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:17,647
Sometimes it's like listening
to pre-programmed tape recorders.

350
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,235
Sometimes all you get
is the vast silence of outer space.

351
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,987
I don't know which is worst.

352
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,239
I have my doubts.

353
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:30,744
What if we were factory workers
and had to have the kids in day care?

354
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:32,037
It doesn't matter.

355
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:34,081
I don't agree.

356
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:37,834
If you speak the same language,
your environment isn't a factor.

357
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:40,170
That's a romantic point of view.

358
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:43,673
Would a life like that affect us?

359
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,300
Are you serious?

360
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:47,677
Yes, I'm serious.

361
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,638
We wouldn't get along as well?

362
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:52,808
I really mean it.
Regardless of language.

363
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:58,688
Isn't there just as much potential
for alienation and loneliness now?

364
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:00,357
Absolutely not.

365
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:06,363
A dull, strenuous job would
wear people down to a greater degree.

366
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,824
You're dumber than I thought.

367
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:13,036
- And you're the romantic, by the way.
- We'll see.

368
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,664
- And exactly what will we see?
- I don't know. Do you?

369
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:19,084
- You're teasing me.
- Yes, I am.

370
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,711
- Aren't you hungry?
- Yes, I'm ravenous.

371
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:26,299
How about a sandwich and a beer?

372
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:28,301
Sounds great.

373
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:33,056
THE ART OF SWEEPING THINGS
UNDER THE RUG

374
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,513
Good morning.

375
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:16,433
Good morning.

376
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:20,437
- Did you sleep well?
- Like a log. How about you?

377
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:22,898
Fine.

378
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:27,235
Only I woke up at 5:00
and couldn't go back to sleep.

379
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,778
Why is that?

380
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,447
I was irritated.

381
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,907
Should I feel guilty?

382
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:37,078
For once you're innocent, my dear.

383
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:41,917
The thought of Sunday dinner with the folks
had me steaming.

384
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,795
We always have Sunday dinner
at your parents' place or mine.

385
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:48,924
- And that's insane.
- We do it to please them.

386
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:50,800
Well, I'm going to cancel.

387
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:54,888
You're going to cancel?
What will your mother say?

388
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:57,390
She can say whatever she likes.

389
00:25:57,474 --> 00:26:00,685
I want to spend the day
with you and the kids.

390
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:02,646
Well, if you can pull it off...

391
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:04,314
I certainly can.

392
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,858
The more I think about it,
the madder I get.

393
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:10,111
- Is your period coming up?
- Why do you always say that?

394
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,321
Well, isn't it?

395
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,657
All right, my period's due on Monday,

396
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,243
but that's not why I'm annoyed.

397
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:17,994
What's bothering you?

398
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:19,496
Just think about it.

399
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:25,001
Every last second of our time
is accounted for and booked solid.

400
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,670
We have our vacations.

401
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,380
Don't you understand?

402
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:30,674
Our vacations
are even more tightly scheduled.

403
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:33,009
Aren't you going to wake the girls?

404
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:35,470
They're sleeping in today.

405
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:40,100
Karin has the day off,
and Eva has a sore throat.

406
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:45,772
I want her to be well by Sunday,
to avoid all the snide remarks.

407
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,691
Weren't you going to cancel dinner?

408
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,526
I want you to do it.

409
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:52,570
I don't want to lock horns
with your mother.

410
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:59,369
Well, aren't you going to call your mother?

411
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,371
Didn't we agree you would do it?

412
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,164
No, honey.

413
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:05,583
I'll hold your hand
and provide moral support.

414
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,131
All right, I'll do it.

415
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:16,219
My heart is racing.

416
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:19,306
The first baby steps in the great revolt.

417
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:35,822
Aren't they in? What a relief.

418
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:40,618
Miss Alm, is my mother in?

419
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:43,455
May I speak to her?

420
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:45,999
How is your knee, Miss Alm?

421
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,336
Oh, it isn't any better, then?

422
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:53,673
It's worse? Now, that's too bad.

423
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,216
What does the doctor say?

424
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:59,471
He's not very understanding. I see.

425
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,559
Hello, Mother.

426
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:07,354
How are you? Good.

427
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:09,397
Dad's already gone?

428
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:13,026
That's right.
He was going out to the country.

429
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:16,363
You let him go off on his own like that?

430
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:20,283
Oh, Erik went with him. That's nice.

431
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:25,455
Listen, I have something to tell you.

432
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:33,004
That's right. How did you guess?

433
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:41,429
Why? I'd like to spend Sunday
with Johan and the girls.

434
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:44,974
No, we're not going anywhere.

435
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:49,062
We just don't feel like
coming over for dinner, that's all.

436
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:57,821
I don't believe for one second
that Dad's been looking forward to it.

437
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:03,743
Really, Mother, it should be
a pleasure and not a duty.

438
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:12,752
I see.

439
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,713
I see.

440
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:18,133
You hadn't told me that.

441
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:22,429
To be honest, not entirely thrilled.

442
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,559
No, forget it, Mother.

443
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:30,562
We'll show up, like we said we would.

444
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:34,858
That'll be just fine. Excellent.

445
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:37,402
Yes, we're looking forward to it.

446
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:40,572
Bye-bye, Mother dear.

447
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:42,031
Bye.

448
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:47,537
The revolution was smothered at birth.

449
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,874
Aunt Elsa is coming to town.
She hasn't visited in six months.

450
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:55,044
She was looking forward to seeing us,
and she has a gift for you.

451
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,422
And Mrs. Danielsson
was coming over to cook.

452
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:00,508
And your dad
was so looking forward to seeing us.

453
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:04,220
I still think you were brave to try.
We'll cancel another time.

454
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,723
Don't be upset.

455
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,478
Will you be home for dinner?

456
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:15,523
I'll meet you at the theater at 7:20.

457
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:17,692
Don't you like coming home anymore?

458
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:21,988
Things are certainly complicated today,
aren't they?

459
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:28,161
I wish we could spend
a whole week in bed just cuddling.

460
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,663
And both of us could cry.

461
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:32,999
That's not the life we chose to lead.

462
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:37,504
I wish I could be certain
our mothers didn't do the choosing.

463
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:40,423
You suffer from
a maternal persecution complex.

464
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,551
Is this the life you wanted?

465
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:44,636
Yes.

466
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:47,430
What if we started cheating on each other?

467
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:49,599
Marianne, please.

468
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,100
What would you do?

469
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:53,478
Kill you, of course.

470
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:59,192
- Sometimes I wish...
- What?

471
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,070
Nothing.

472
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:05,698
Wait a second. I'll go with you.

473
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:07,700
Wouldn't it be better
if you took your own car?

474
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:10,787
No, this way we can drive home
from the theater together.

475
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,289
- What about the girls?
- Mrs. Andersson is coming today.

476
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:16,042
I'll call her from town
and ask if she can cook something.

477
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:19,629
She makes great pancakes.
I'll go wake the girls.

478
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:22,423
- I'm in a hurry.
- It'll only take a minute.

479
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:47,008
Oh, by the way,
please pay your parking tickets.

480
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:49,385
There's a whole stack of them.

481
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:50,720
Yes, sir.

482
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,105
See you at the theater.

483
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:16,662
Yes, it's me.

484
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,000
Oh, hi, Mother. The line's so bad,
I didn't recognize your voice.

485
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,087
I'm fine, thank you. How are you?

486
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:27,965
You're concerned? Now, why is that?

487
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:30,927
Marianne's mother called...

488
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:33,680
and she's concerned too?

489
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:35,932
Good grief.

490
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:40,144
No, Marianne and I are getting along fine.

491
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:45,900
We're healthy, cheerful and insanely happy.

492
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:51,698
Nothing's wrong, I swear. Don't worry.

493
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:57,995
Your intuition? Well, it's led you astray.

494
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,081
Marianne and I are happy together.

495
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:05,169
Tell Marianne's mother she should
do something more constructive

496
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:07,547
than gossip about worst-case scenarios.

497
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:11,884
I'm pretty busy right now, Mother.

498
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:16,472
I'll see you soon.

499
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:19,434
We'll stop by on Friday,
just like we promised.

500
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:20,977
Give my best to Dad.

501
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,938
Damn.

502
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:34,157
Hi. Am I disturbing you?

503
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,658
Please do.

504
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:38,244
I just had to see what you're up to.

505
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:41,581
There are so many rumors floating around.

506
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:44,417
What are you doing?

507
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,211
This does look mysterious.

508
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:50,882
- Shouldn't you be in Lund?
- Yes.

509
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:54,343
But the students are demonstrating
for some deserving cause or another,

510
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:57,221
and the lectures were canceled.

511
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:58,931
Lucky you.

512
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:01,768
- What's this going to be?
- Take a look.

513
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:04,437
- What am I supposed to do?
- Hold this pen.

514
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:12,278
When I turn off the lights,
you'll see a bright dot on the wall.

515
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:15,698
Try to touch it with the tip of the pen.

516
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:18,785
If you miss, draw a line to it.

517
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:23,206
We'll get it all on camera.

518
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:26,167
- But it's dark.
- We're using infrared lighting.

519
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,628
I'll watch you on the monitor.

520
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,259
Lights out.

521
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:40,640
Be my guest.

522
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,184
Go ahead.

523
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,584
Are you pulling my leg?

524
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:11,170
Not at all. Go on.

525
00:36:11,254 --> 00:36:13,506
Could you...

526
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:15,925
It keeps moving.

527
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:19,846
It's not a trick.
Actually, the dot is stationary.

528
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:38,656
I've had enough of this!
Turn the lights back on.

529
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:41,242
My, you're upset.

530
00:36:42,577 --> 00:36:43,953
That was unpleasant.

531
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:47,373
Yes, it makes you nervous.

532
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:48,583
Funny, isn't it?

533
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:52,378
Look how you drifted, getting more
and more irritated by the minute.

534
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:55,089
So what does it prove?

535
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:57,717
That remains to be seen.
This is only the beginning.

536
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,309
- I'd like a cigarette.
- Go ahead. Have a seat.

537
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:07,518
No!

538
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:09,979
I gave up smoking six days ago,

539
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:12,106
and it's a pain!

540
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:14,984
Having withdrawal symptoms?

541
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:17,778
Stefan's away

542
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:19,739
and my friends are avoiding me.

543
00:37:20,698 --> 00:37:22,825
I'll go back to it,

544
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,785
but I'll try to stick to my guns a while.

545
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:26,537
Go on, take a cigarette.

546
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:29,665
Bromeus left a pack behind
when he spied on me yesterday.

547
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:47,350
Oh, that's heaven.

548
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:48,476
What a relief.

549
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:50,353
Well?

550
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:57,610
Right.

551
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:03,032
I spent the entire afternoon yesterday
reading your poems.

552
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,952
Very carefully, from start to finish.
Twice.

553
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:10,957
- They baffled me.
- Were they so very strange?

554
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,125
That's not it.

555
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,878
They weren't strange?

556
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:18,214
Well, I might be wrong.

557
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:24,637
Has Marianne read them?

558
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:27,640
No, you're the only one
I've shown them to.

559
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:29,558
Marianne's not interested in poetry.

560
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:32,770
- She ought to be interested in you.
- She is, but not in that respect.

561
00:38:33,604 --> 00:38:34,855
She's not?

562
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:38,109
- Really?
- What's so odd about that?

563
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:41,696
You and I have been friends
since we were students.

564
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,240
We've never been sexually involved.

565
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:49,161
You can provide an objective opinion
before I try the publishers.

566
00:38:50,788 --> 00:38:51,998
I wouldn't bother.

567
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:56,002
Are they that bad?

568
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:59,714
No, it's not that they're bad.

569
00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:03,634
If only that were the case.

570
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:06,971
They're mediocre, is that it?

571
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:13,561
They're insipid, proper and puerile?

572
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:16,772
They're too personal,

573
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:18,941
like indulging in spiritual masturbation?

574
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:23,070
In our old crowd,

575
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:25,781
many believed
you were destined for greatness.

576
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:29,326
We admired you.

577
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:32,830
You were way ahead of us.

578
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:37,585
We admired and even envied you.

579
00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:39,670
What's that got to do with my poetry?

580
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:42,798
Nothing. It was just a thought.

581
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:46,469
I guess the withdrawal symptoms
colored your view.

582
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:48,554
You appear stressed.

583
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:49,805
That's possible.

584
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:53,726
I'm going to show them to others
before I scrap them.

585
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:56,187
Of course you should.

586
00:39:56,270 --> 00:40:00,399
The publishing houses
will have to tell me how bad they are.

587
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:02,818
I've offended you.

588
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:04,737
You sure did.

589
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:07,448
I'm sorry.

590
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:11,494
At least there's one person
who appreciates them.

591
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:13,871
- Who would that be?
- Are you curious?

592
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:21,295
My dear little Johan.

593
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:29,929
Pay no attention to me.

594
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:32,473
- It was just my craving talking.
- Right.

595
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:37,394
Well, I've got to go.

596
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:39,855
I'll leave your poems at the door.

597
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:42,024
Give my love to Marianne.

598
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:47,947
You know I'll always be there for you.

599
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,448
That's nice of you.

600
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:51,992
Bye.

601
00:40:52,076 --> 00:40:55,412
I'll see you around 12:30 then.

602
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:57,623
Bye.

603
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:02,378
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

604
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:07,716
In this first meeting
we usually establish the issues

605
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,718
and look at how to solve them.

606
00:41:09,802 --> 00:41:10,886
I want a divorce.

607
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:15,015
- How long have you been married?
- Over 20 years.

608
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,310
Do you have a profession?

609
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:20,771
No, I'm a housewife.

610
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:24,150
Why do you want a divorce?

611
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:32,700
There's no love in our marriage.

612
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:36,662
Is that the reason?

613
00:41:37,163 --> 00:41:38,372
Yes.

614
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:43,460
You've been married for a long time.
Was this always the case?

615
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:45,379
Yes, always.

616
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:50,467
And now that your children have left the nest,
you want to leave as well.

617
00:41:56,182 --> 00:41:59,185
My husband is a responsible man.
He's kind and conscientious.

618
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:02,521
I have nothing to complain about.

619
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:06,692
He's been an excellent father.
We've never quarreled.

620
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:09,945
We have a nice apartment

621
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:13,532
and a lovely summer cottage
we inherited from my mother-in-law.

622
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:17,703
We're both fond of music.

623
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:21,540
We belong to a chamber music society
and play together.

624
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:23,709
It all sounds ideal.

625
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,377
Yes, it does.

626
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:31,592
But there is no love between us.
There never has been any.

627
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,845
Forgive me for asking,

628
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:37,723
but have you met someone?

629
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:42,561
No, I haven't.

630
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:44,605
What about your husband?

631
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:47,358
As far as I know,
he's never been unfaithful.

632
00:42:47,441 --> 00:42:49,068
Won't you be lonely?

633
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:52,112
I guess.

634
00:42:54,073 --> 00:42:58,494
But it's even lonelier
living in a loveless marriage.

635
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,166
Have you told your husband
you want a divorce?

636
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:07,044
Of course.

637
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:11,090
Fifteen years ago I told him
I didn't want to live with him anymore,

638
00:43:11,173 --> 00:43:13,801
since there was no love in our marriage.

639
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:16,262
He was very understanding.

640
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:19,848
He merely asked me to wait
until the children had grown up.

641
00:43:19,932 --> 00:43:22,935
Now all three have grown up and left home.

642
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:25,729
Now I can have my divorce.

643
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:27,898
So what does he say?

644
00:43:31,068 --> 00:43:36,115
He keeps asking me
what's wrong with our marriage.

645
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:43,080
And I tell him I can't go on
with a relationship that lacks love.

646
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:47,584
Then he asks me
what love is supposed to involve.

647
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,964
But I tell him I don't know.

648
00:43:52,423 --> 00:43:55,801
How can I describe something
that's not there?

649
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:59,680
Have you been on good terms
with your children?

650
00:43:59,763 --> 00:44:01,724
Emotionally.

651
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:03,726
I've never loved my children.

652
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:06,478
I know that now.

653
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:10,816
I used to think I did. You always do.

654
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:14,778
But I know now that I never loved them.

655
00:44:16,155 --> 00:44:19,283
Still, I've been a good mother.

656
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:21,910
I've done all I could,

657
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:25,456
even though I never felt anything for them.

658
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:34,923
I know just what you're thinking.

659
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:37,551
Really?

660
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:41,680
"A spoiled woman with no sense of humor.

661
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:44,850
She has everything she could possibly want,

662
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:50,439
but still she goes on about love.

663
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:55,986
What about friendship, loyalty, security?"

664
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,489
Something like that, yes.

665
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:04,036
Let me tell you something.

666
00:45:06,372 --> 00:45:08,749
I have a mental picture of myself

667
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:12,127
that doesn't correspond to reality.

668
00:45:14,588 --> 00:45:16,048
Pardon me...

669
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:19,301
if I ask you a personal question.

670
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:24,348
Isn't it true that love...

671
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:30,687
What were you going to ask?

672
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:34,483
I'm not sure. Forgive me.

673
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:45,244
I tell myself I have the capacity to love.

674
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:49,164
But it's been...

675
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,961
bottled up.

676
00:45:57,506 --> 00:46:01,885
The life I've led has stifled my potential.

677
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:06,140
The time has come to change all that.

678
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:09,810
The first step is divorce.

679
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:11,770
My husband and I...

680
00:46:13,939 --> 00:46:15,774
cancel each other out.

681
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:18,819
That sounds frightening.

682
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:22,239
It is frightening.

683
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:26,452
Something peculiar is happening.

684
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:32,666
My senses... sight, hearing, touch...

685
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:34,501
are starting to fail me.

686
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:36,712
This table, for instance.

687
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:39,131
I can see it and touch it.

688
00:46:41,133 --> 00:46:43,343
But the sensation

689
00:46:43,427 --> 00:46:46,263
is deadened and dry.

690
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:49,308
Do you understand?

691
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:54,646
I think I do.

692
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:57,816
It's the same with everything...

693
00:46:58,692 --> 00:47:03,822
music, scents, faces, voices.

694
00:47:05,282 --> 00:47:07,409
Everything seems

695
00:47:07,493 --> 00:47:10,329
puny, gray,

696
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:12,623
and undignified.

697
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,960
Now for some food and drink.

698
00:47:17,044 --> 00:47:18,879
And to get out of these clothes.

699
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:24,176
Getting through Ibsen
on nothing but a hot dog was an ordeal.

700
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:27,054
Remember when our parents
almost threw us out

701
00:47:27,137 --> 00:47:29,139
because we joined the May Day parade?

702
00:47:29,223 --> 00:47:31,308
You were more zealous about politics.

703
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:35,938
And you accused me
of neglecting our home.

704
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:38,857
That was the year
we came down with the Asian flu.

705
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:43,278
We thought the future was bright.

706
00:47:43,362 --> 00:47:46,114
It's nice to have faith in things.

707
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,577
And we had the pleasure of annoying
our parents at the same time.

708
00:47:51,495 --> 00:47:53,163
You were such a hothead back then.

709
00:47:53,247 --> 00:47:55,165
Not as bad as your dad.

710
00:47:55,249 --> 00:47:57,543
No, you were worse.
Pretty and hotheaded.

711
00:47:57,626 --> 00:48:00,963
You were awfully attractive as a socialist.

712
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:02,965
- Aren't I now?
- What?

713
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:05,634
- Awfully attractive?
- Of course.

714
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:09,054
But married couples
aren't as hot for each other after a while.

715
00:48:10,556 --> 00:48:13,767
That's not true in our case though.

716
00:48:14,643 --> 00:48:16,645
We're just too busy.

717
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:19,606
When evening rolls around,
we're exhausted.

718
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:23,485
That wasn't meant as a reproach.
I swear.

719
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:25,696
We like each other in every way.

720
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:27,698
Not in that way.

721
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,616
Not very much, anyway.

722
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,076
Oh, yes, we do.

723
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:34,454
Our life is full of little evasions
and restrictions.

724
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:40,836
I can't help the fact
I don't enjoy it as much as I used to.

725
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:43,213
There's a perfectly natural explanation.

726
00:48:43,297 --> 00:48:46,008
Don't lay this guilt on me.

727
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:47,759
Don't get so upset.

728
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:50,596
I think we have it nice.

729
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:53,181
Things are not as passionate
as they once were,

730
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:55,517
but we could be worse off.

731
00:48:55,601 --> 00:48:57,519
Without a doubt.

732
00:48:57,603 --> 00:48:59,938
Sex isn't everything, after all.

733
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:04,901
If you're not satisfied,
go find yourself a mistress

734
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:08,614
who's more imaginative and exciting.

735
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,700
I do my best, I assure you.

736
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:12,826
There we have it.

737
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:19,708
- You've got that look again.
- I haven't got any look.

738
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:24,004
That look and that tone of voice.
Instead of brooding, just spit it out.

739
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:26,340
You'll just lose your temper.

740
00:49:26,423 --> 00:49:29,426
No, I'm listening... with an open mind.

741
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:33,972
Sometimes I wonder why
we complicate this problem so awfully.

742
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:37,225
Making love is pretty basic.

743
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:41,605
It shouldn't be a huge, overshadowing issue.

744
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:45,108
It's your mother's fault, if you ask me,
though you don't like my saying so.

745
00:49:45,192 --> 00:49:49,863
- What a superficial analysis.
- Don't be a sourpuss. I'm being nice.

746
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:52,491
You think it's my fault
we don't enjoy it anymore.

747
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:56,828
- You just said you do your best.
- I really do.

748
00:49:56,912 --> 00:49:59,289
Can't you hear
how preposterous that sounds?

749
00:49:59,373 --> 00:50:01,041
Are you calling me a liar?

750
00:50:01,124 --> 00:50:03,168
No, for Christ's sake.

751
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:04,795
Then I don't understand.

752
00:50:06,213 --> 00:50:10,926
Let's drop this and go to bed.
It's late.

753
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:16,390
It's just like you to start a discussion
to get me all riled up,

754
00:50:16,473 --> 00:50:19,101
only to yawn and say it's bedtime.

755
00:50:20,102 --> 00:50:24,064
You suffer from
devastatingly high standards.

756
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:26,983
We've often joked and argued about it.

757
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:32,739
But can't our poor sex life
be spared your ambitions?

758
00:50:32,823 --> 00:50:36,368
Why won't you cut me some slack?

759
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:40,455
First you attack me for not trying
and then for making the effort.

760
00:50:41,665 --> 00:50:43,166
What a mess I've made.

761
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,085
Yes, you sure have.

762
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:56,722
It would be more helpful if you were kind.

763
00:50:56,805 --> 00:51:00,892
There, there, sweetheart.
I shouldn't have brought it up.

764
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:06,314
It's possible to talk too much
about these things, you know.

765
00:51:06,398 --> 00:51:07,441
Yes, it is.

766
00:51:07,524 --> 00:51:11,945
I know you should discuss everything
and not keep secrets.

767
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:14,197
But in this case I think it's wrong.

768
00:51:14,281 --> 00:51:16,074
I think you're right.

769
00:51:16,158 --> 00:51:20,495
Some matters should be protected
from prying eyes.

770
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:21,830
You think so?

771
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,999
I'm sure of it.

772
00:51:24,082 --> 00:51:28,545
We hurt each other for no reason,

773
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:31,715
and the barbs are still there
when we go to bed.

774
00:51:32,466 --> 00:51:35,427
It's like lying on a bed of nails.

775
00:51:37,095 --> 00:51:39,639
- What are you laughing at?
- The bed of nails bit.

776
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:44,519
- Go on and laugh then.
- Let's go to bed.

777
00:51:44,603 --> 00:51:48,190
Only if you admit that you've been tactless.

778
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:49,900
I apologize.

779
00:51:52,778 --> 00:51:55,322
Don't I give you enough affection?

780
00:51:56,114 --> 00:51:57,949
Affection takes time.

781
00:51:58,658 --> 00:52:00,202
Then you don't get enough.

782
00:52:00,285 --> 00:52:03,830
<i>We</i> don't get enough.
Or give enough.

783
00:52:04,706 --> 00:52:09,085
That's why I wanted us
to go away this summer.

784
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:12,297
Affection shouldn't be kept
just for vacations.

785
00:52:14,049 --> 00:52:16,301
You're nice... for a moron.

786
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:18,553
It's lucky I'm married to you then.

787
00:52:19,638 --> 00:52:24,059
You have moments of greatness,
interspersed with sheer mediocrity.

788
00:52:24,142 --> 00:52:26,186
I'm sure that's true.

789
00:52:26,937 --> 00:52:31,483
At our age, tens of thousands
of brain cells burn out every day,

790
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:33,527
and they're never replaced.

791
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:36,404
Well, a fool like you
must lose a million a day.

792
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:43,620
You're adorable,
even though you do scold and fuss.

793
00:52:47,874 --> 00:52:50,836
Right. I'm nearly asleep anyway.

794
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:53,797
I'll just go check on the children.

795
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:56,967
Don't worry. I'm practically asleep.

796
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:12,566
- Aren't you going to set the alarm?
- I've got it in my hand.

797
00:53:19,364 --> 00:53:21,741
If you like, you can make love to me.

798
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:26,288
Thanks for the offer, but I'm too tired.

799
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:14,085
It can't be!

800
00:54:14,169 --> 00:54:17,923
You're here already?
I wasn't expecting you until tomorrow.

801
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:21,426
What a lovely surprise!
Are you hungry?

802
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:23,762
How sweet of you to get here sooner.

803
00:54:23,845 --> 00:54:27,474
The girls are asleep.
We all went to bed early.

804
00:54:27,557 --> 00:54:31,102
There was nothing on TV,
so we turned in early.

805
00:54:31,728 --> 00:54:34,272
The girls and I have been dieting today.

806
00:54:34,356 --> 00:54:37,359
Would you like a sandwich?

807
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:38,985
That sounds nice.

808
00:54:39,069 --> 00:54:44,866
Or should I fry some ham and eggs?
Or heat up some soup?

809
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:47,077
Sandwiches and beer will be just fine.

810
00:54:47,786 --> 00:54:51,623
By the way, Peter and Katarina
are going to call you on Monday.

811
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:54,709
It's quite an ordeal they're going through.

812
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:56,670
Are they getting divorced?

813
00:54:56,753 --> 00:54:59,965
They don't seem to know what they want.

814
00:55:00,048 --> 00:55:01,925
Is that so strange?

815
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:05,720
I advised them to get separate lawyers,
but they refused.

816
00:55:06,888 --> 00:55:10,725
Listen, change into your pajamas
and I'll bring a tray up to the bedroom.

817
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:12,519
Sounds good.

818
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:17,440
And here I was worried
you might be angry with me.

819
00:55:17,524 --> 00:55:21,569
- Why should I be angry?
- I was nasty on the phone last night.

820
00:55:21,653 --> 00:55:23,697
Oh, that. That was nothing.

821
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:27,492
I called back,
but you must have unplugged the phone.

822
00:55:27,575 --> 00:55:29,911
I was pretty tired.

823
00:55:29,995 --> 00:55:33,957
I'd spent the day
with that zombie from the ministry.

824
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:39,087
It makes you wonder about the idiots
in charge of our well-being.

825
00:55:39,546 --> 00:55:42,799
I still think I behaved badly.

826
00:55:42,882 --> 00:55:44,759
Let's drop it.

827
00:55:44,843 --> 00:55:48,722
You never want
to finish discussions, do you?

828
00:55:48,805 --> 00:55:51,224
But this won't take long, dear.

829
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:57,981
All I wanted to say was
that you were right, but so was I.

830
00:55:58,064 --> 00:56:03,611
If you don't want to wear a tuxedo,
that's your business. I agree.

831
00:56:04,154 --> 00:56:07,490
But if I think you should get a new tux,
then I have a right to say so.

832
00:56:07,574 --> 00:56:11,202
I don't like tuxedos.
I hate wearing a tuxedo.

833
00:56:11,286 --> 00:56:15,498
It's a ridiculous getup.
I feel like a dressed-up chimpanzee.

834
00:56:15,582 --> 00:56:19,419
Yes, you told me that.
Let's not quarrel.

835
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:22,922
I love you, even if you won't wear a tux.

836
00:56:23,006 --> 00:56:25,842
It's hardly essential to our marriage.

837
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:29,679
- It sure seemed that way last night.
- I told you I was wrong.

838
00:56:37,687 --> 00:56:40,732
I'm getting hungry just watching you eat.

839
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:46,946
I can't help it.
I've got to have a sandwich.

840
00:56:48,531 --> 00:56:51,242
I'm so hungry, I'm dizzy.

841
00:56:52,869 --> 00:56:56,081
I've lost almost five pounds this week.

842
00:56:57,582 --> 00:56:59,459
- Does it show?
- No.

843
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:02,212
I can feel a difference, though.

844
00:57:02,295 --> 00:57:05,799
But it seems so pointless at times.

845
00:57:05,882 --> 00:57:09,636
I mean, why should we deny ourselves
the good things in life?

846
00:57:10,345 --> 00:57:14,182
Why can't we be fat and cheerful?

847
00:57:15,183 --> 00:57:17,769
Remember Aunt Miriam and Uncle David?

848
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:21,397
They were big, fat and cheerful.

849
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:27,612
They slept in that creaky double bed
of theirs, holding hands,

850
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:32,617
content with each other, fat and happy.

851
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:36,704
Why can't we be like them?

852
00:57:36,788 --> 00:57:39,541
Brimming with contentment?

853
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:43,211
What's the matter?

854
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:46,297
Are you upset?

855
00:57:48,341 --> 00:57:49,759
Has something happened?

856
00:57:51,511 --> 00:57:53,304
What's wrong?

857
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:56,516
Tell me.

858
00:58:01,938 --> 00:58:05,150
I came here to tell you something.

859
00:58:09,779 --> 00:58:11,865
I've gone and fallen in love.

860
00:58:13,825 --> 00:58:16,995
It's absurd, and probably a big mistake.

861
00:58:17,078 --> 00:58:18,788
Most probably a big mistake.

862
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:26,963
I met her at that convention in June.

863
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:30,758
She was the interpreter and secretary.

864
00:58:30,842 --> 00:58:35,555
Actually, she's studying for her degree.
She's going to teach Slavic languages.

865
00:58:39,601 --> 00:58:42,562
She's nothing much to look at.

866
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:45,356
You would probably think she's ugly.

867
00:58:48,526 --> 00:58:50,695
I have no idea what this will lead to.

868
00:58:51,988 --> 00:58:53,907
I have no idea about anything.

869
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:56,784
I'm utterly bewildered.

870
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:03,124
Of course, I'm happy in one way.

871
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:05,960
But I do feel damn guilty
about you and the children.

872
00:59:07,128 --> 00:59:09,130
We've always gotten along so well.

873
00:59:12,467 --> 00:59:17,680
Things have been no better and no worse

874
00:59:17,764 --> 00:59:19,849
than for the average family.

875
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,189
Say something, for Christ's sake.

876
00:59:30,026 --> 00:59:32,028
I don't know what to say.

877
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:39,577
You probably think it was wrong of me
not to tell you sooner.

878
00:59:40,954 --> 00:59:45,208
I didn't know how it would turn out.
I figured I'd get over it.

879
00:59:46,209 --> 00:59:48,086
I didn't want to worry you.

880
00:59:50,255 --> 00:59:51,798
It's funny.

881
00:59:52,507 --> 00:59:54,259
What's funny?

882
00:59:55,176 --> 00:59:57,929
That I didn't notice anything.

883
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:02,976
I didn't suspect a thing.

884
01:00:03,518 --> 01:00:05,520
Everything's been just like usual.

885
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:08,439
Better, in fact.

886
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:10,942
You've been so sweet.

887
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:16,197
I've been a silly, blind fool.

888
01:00:16,281 --> 01:00:19,117
I didn't even notice.

889
01:00:21,286 --> 01:00:22,328
Christ.

890
01:00:22,412 --> 01:00:24,622
No, you never noticed.

891
01:00:24,706 --> 01:00:26,833
But you've never been particularly observant.

892
01:00:32,714 --> 01:00:34,799
Where do we go from here?

893
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,593
I don't know.

894
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:39,679
Do you want a divorce?

895
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:41,514
Are you going to marry her?

896
01:00:42,265 --> 01:00:45,476
Why tell me tonight of all times?

897
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,855
What's the rush all of a sudden?

898
01:00:56,696 --> 01:00:58,239
We're leaving for Paris tomorrow.

899
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:04,662
I want to get away.

900
01:01:04,746 --> 01:01:06,664
At least for a while.

901
01:01:07,999 --> 01:01:12,003
I was going this fall anyway,
to see Grandin and his assistant.

902
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:17,050
Paula has this study grant
and wants to use it this fall.

903
01:01:18,968 --> 01:01:20,845
I want to be with her.

904
01:01:22,013 --> 01:01:23,931
I can't make it without her.

905
01:01:26,142 --> 01:01:28,019
So we're leaving tomorrow.

906
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:37,695
Now that I'm here, talking to you,

907
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:40,948
I feel like scrapping the whole thing.

908
01:01:41,491 --> 01:01:43,576
I just feel frightened and tired.

909
01:01:46,329 --> 01:01:49,457
Nothing could be more absurd or clichéd.

910
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,250
I know just what you're thinking.

911
01:01:51,334 --> 01:01:53,002
I have no excuse.

912
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:57,590
How can you know what I'm thinking?

913
01:01:59,092 --> 01:02:01,677
I'm trying not to feel guilty.

914
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:04,222
That would just be an act.

915
01:02:06,224 --> 01:02:08,518
This is how it is,
and nothing can be done about it.

916
01:02:11,062 --> 01:02:13,106
Let's go to bed. It's late.

917
01:02:13,189 --> 01:02:14,829
I guess you'll be leaving early tomorrow.

918
01:02:16,943 --> 01:02:20,113
I have an appointment at 9:00.

919
01:02:21,864 --> 01:02:24,200
Then I suggest we go to bed.

920
01:03:42,487 --> 01:03:44,155
Aren't you going to change?

921
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:10,473
- You have marks on your chest.
- I know.

922
01:04:10,556 --> 01:04:12,350
How tactless of you both.

923
01:04:14,936 --> 01:04:18,940
Do you know if my gray suit
is here or in town?

924
01:04:19,023 --> 01:04:22,026
- It's at the dry cleaners.
- What a nuisance.

925
01:04:23,319 --> 01:04:26,906
- Did you want to take it with you?
- Of course.

926
01:04:28,074 --> 01:04:31,786
I have the receipt,
if you'd like to pick it up.

927
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:33,371
I won't have time.

928
01:04:33,955 --> 01:04:35,998
I'll be busy until 3:00.

929
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:38,501
And then we leave.

930
01:04:39,168 --> 01:04:42,213
If you like, I could pick it up.

931
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:48,010
I'll do your packing too.
You're not very good at it.

932
01:04:48,094 --> 01:04:49,845
No, thank you.

933
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:51,514
Now you're being silly.

934
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:53,891
I'm quite conventional.

935
01:04:55,434 --> 01:04:58,521
Besides the suit,
I think you have everything you'll need.

936
01:05:00,398 --> 01:05:04,652
There are clean shirts and underwear,
so you can take those with you.

937
01:05:08,072 --> 01:05:12,827
Why don't you travel
in your jacket and flannels?

938
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:15,705
- They make you look youthful.
- Whatever you say.

939
01:05:27,508 --> 01:05:29,343
How long will you be gone?

940
01:05:30,428 --> 01:05:33,055
- It all depends.
- What do you mean?

941
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:38,102
I've been granted a leave of absence
for six months,

942
01:05:38,185 --> 01:05:42,106
and I'm bringing
a month's worth of work with me.

943
01:05:42,857 --> 01:05:45,318
So I guess I'll be away
for at least seven or eight months.

944
01:05:47,069 --> 01:05:49,071
I want to make a clean break.

945
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:57,913
- And if I'm not here when...
- I don't give a damn.

946
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:04,629
Do you know how long I've had this in mind?

947
01:06:05,463 --> 01:06:07,506
Not the affair with Paula,

948
01:06:08,966 --> 01:06:12,762
but how long I've wanted to leave?

949
01:06:13,346 --> 01:06:14,388
Don't say it.

950
01:06:14,472 --> 01:06:16,766
I've wanted to be rid of you for four years.

951
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:19,018
- No more.
- You're right.

952
01:06:19,101 --> 01:06:20,603
Words don't mean much.

953
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:41,499
What are you going to live on?
I mean, during your leave of absence.

954
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:45,461
You'll have to pay child support.

955
01:06:47,046 --> 01:06:49,173
Don't worry. I'll manage.

956
01:06:51,342 --> 01:06:54,053
You must have assets I'm not aware of.

957
01:06:54,136 --> 01:06:56,055
Indeed I do.

958
01:06:58,015 --> 01:06:59,225
How is that possible?

959
01:07:00,893 --> 01:07:02,645
Shut up and listen!

960
01:07:03,688 --> 01:07:05,648
Even though
it's none of your damn business.

961
01:07:07,566 --> 01:07:09,318
I've sold the boat

962
01:07:10,569 --> 01:07:13,781
and taken out a loan.

963
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:19,370
The bank will pay you and the girls
1,600 kronor a month.

964
01:07:20,204 --> 01:07:23,791
We'll make other arrangements
when I get back.

965
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:27,837
I suggest you ask one of
your lawyer colleagues for advice.

966
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,048
I don't give a damn.
You can name your price.

967
01:07:32,299 --> 01:07:34,885
I'm not taking a thing,

968
01:07:34,969 --> 01:07:37,763
apart from my books,
if that's all right with you.

969
01:07:38,723 --> 01:07:42,101
I'll vanish. I'll dematerialize.

970
01:07:44,061 --> 01:07:47,064
I'll pay all I can
to support you and the children.

971
01:07:47,773 --> 01:07:49,650
My needs are minimal.

972
01:07:49,734 --> 01:07:52,236
All that interests me is to end this.

973
01:07:58,617 --> 01:08:01,454
Guess what I'm fed up with most of all.

974
01:08:02,121 --> 01:08:05,833
All this harping
about what we're expected to do

975
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:08,169
and what we must take into consideration.

976
01:08:08,753 --> 01:08:11,756
"What will your mother think?"
"What will the children say?"

977
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:16,761
"How shall we arrange the dinner party,
and shouldn't we invite my father?"

978
01:08:18,429 --> 01:08:22,850
"We must go to the coast,
to the mountains, to St. Moritz."

979
01:08:22,933 --> 01:08:28,147
"We must celebrate Christmas,
Easter, birthdays, name days..."

980
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:30,274
Every single goddamn occasion!

981
01:08:38,908 --> 01:08:43,621
- My poor darling...
- I don't want your sympathy!

982
01:08:49,919 --> 01:08:53,297
All these words I'm spouting
are just empty talk.

983
01:08:54,006 --> 01:08:57,259
I don't imagine for one minute
that I've touched on the truth about us.

984
01:08:58,302 --> 01:09:00,888
I don't think
there is such a thing as the truth.

985
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:07,603
No matter what we say or do,
it will hurt.

986
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:17,238
Don't go.

987
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:19,073
That's impossible.

988
01:09:19,156 --> 01:09:22,910
- What if I beg?
- It's no use, and it's embarrassing.

989
01:09:23,536 --> 01:09:26,831
Couldn't you postpone your trip
for a month or two?

990
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,875
I believe we can save our marriage.

991
01:09:29,959 --> 01:09:34,672
We could make a fresh start.
Allow me that much.

992
01:09:35,673 --> 01:09:37,967
Maybe Paula would understand me.

993
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:41,387
Maybe I should meet her
and talk to her.

994
01:09:44,056 --> 01:09:47,017
Let's face this together.

995
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:53,440
You're presenting me with a fait accompli.

996
01:09:54,066 --> 01:09:58,320
You're putting me in a ridiculous
and intolerable situation.

997
01:09:58,404 --> 01:10:00,573
I know exactly what you mean.

998
01:10:00,656 --> 01:10:03,450
What will our parents say?
What will your sister think?

999
01:10:03,534 --> 01:10:06,453
What will our friends think?
Lord, think of all the gossip!

1000
01:10:06,537 --> 01:10:10,040
How will it affect the girls,
and their friends' mothers?

1001
01:10:10,124 --> 01:10:14,086
What about the dinner parties
we're already scheduled to attend?

1002
01:10:14,169 --> 01:10:16,130
And what will you tell
Peter and Katarina?

1003
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:18,299
To hell with all that!

1004
01:10:18,382 --> 01:10:21,093
It feels good to act like a cad.

1005
01:10:21,176 --> 01:10:23,804
- That wasn't what I meant.
- Then what did you mean?

1006
01:10:23,888 --> 01:10:25,306
Nothing.

1007
01:10:39,737 --> 01:10:41,864
I forgot to set the alarm.

1008
01:10:43,115 --> 01:10:45,075
When do you need to leave?

1009
01:10:46,285 --> 01:10:49,204
Please set it for 5:30.

1010
01:10:49,288 --> 01:10:53,584
I need to pack, and I have
to be at work by 9:00.

1011
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,421
I've been meaning
to get a new alarm clock.

1012
01:10:58,839 --> 01:11:01,675
This one is so noisy.

1013
01:11:01,759 --> 01:11:04,094
And it's not very reliable either.

1014
01:11:04,178 --> 01:11:07,723
There. It's set for 5:30.

1015
01:11:07,806 --> 01:11:11,894
I'll wake up on my own anyway,
so you don't have to worry.

1016
01:11:22,154 --> 01:11:24,615
- Tell me about Paula.
- For the love of...

1017
01:11:26,617 --> 01:11:28,535
- What's the point?
- I want you to.

1018
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:29,995
Why torment yourself?

1019
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:33,082
It's not self-torment.
I want to know what she's like.

1020
01:11:33,165 --> 01:11:37,252
It's much worse to try to picture
someone you know nothing about.

1021
01:11:40,589 --> 01:11:42,508
Do you have a picture of her?

1022
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,718
Could we not do this?

1023
01:11:44,802 --> 01:11:47,262
Please do it for me.

1024
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:50,683
You asked for it.

1025
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:56,730
Now, where did I put my wallet?
I guess it's in my coat pocket.

1026
01:12:09,493 --> 01:12:11,537
Here are two pictures of her.

1027
01:12:13,622 --> 01:12:16,834
That one was taken two years ago,
when she was on vacation.

1028
01:12:17,543 --> 01:12:21,338
The passport picture was taken
two weeks ago. It's a good likeness.

1029
01:12:29,013 --> 01:12:30,973
She has a lovely figure.

1030
01:12:32,224 --> 01:12:35,144
And lovely breasts. Right?

1031
01:12:35,227 --> 01:12:37,021
Yes, she has lovely breasts.

1032
01:12:40,566 --> 01:12:44,903
- Does she dye her hair?
- It's possible.

1033
01:12:46,363 --> 01:12:48,115
What a nice smile.

1034
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:50,367
- How old is she?
- Twenty-three.

1035
01:12:58,292 --> 01:13:02,629
She hasn't been very lucky in love.

1036
01:13:03,964 --> 01:13:06,216
She's been engaged twice.

1037
01:13:07,259 --> 01:13:12,014
In that respect, I think she's made
a muddle of her life with all kinds of men.

1038
01:13:13,432 --> 01:13:14,850
Does that bother you?

1039
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:17,102
It sure does.

1040
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:23,400
Her frankness can be quite unpleasant.

1041
01:13:24,693 --> 01:13:26,236
I would prefer not to know anything,

1042
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,490
but she insists on giving me
the details of her erotic past.

1043
01:13:30,824 --> 01:13:35,579
Which is trying, since I suffer
from retrospective jealousy.

1044
01:13:37,498 --> 01:13:40,292
She has no illusions.

1045
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:45,464
She says she has
no great hopes for the two of us.

1046
01:13:45,547 --> 01:13:47,591
She's convinced I'll go back to you,

1047
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:50,094
that she doesn't have
a chance against you.

1048
01:13:50,177 --> 01:13:56,100
Sometimes it sounds like lines
from some old hackneyed melodrama.

1049
01:14:01,105 --> 01:14:02,981
Are you good together in bed?

1050
01:14:19,164 --> 01:14:21,250
Yes, we are, actually.

1051
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:29,716
At first it was awful.

1052
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:34,888
I wasn't used to it.
Being with other women, I mean.

1053
01:14:34,972 --> 01:14:36,765
I guess you and I
have spoiled each other.

1054
01:14:37,641 --> 01:14:43,021
You and I have taken refuge
in a hermetically sealed existence.

1055
01:14:43,105 --> 01:14:46,066
Everything's been orderly,
and it's all gone like clockwork.

1056
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:48,068
But the lack of oxygen has smothered us.

1057
01:14:48,152 --> 01:14:51,697
And now your little Paula
will revive you?

1058
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:55,742
I don't possess much self-knowledge,

1059
01:14:56,785 --> 01:15:00,497
and I know very little about reality,
in spite of all the books I've read.

1060
01:15:01,999 --> 01:15:06,128
But I believe that this catastrophe
is the chance of a lifetime.

1061
01:15:07,004 --> 01:15:10,174
Has Paula filled your head
with garbage like that?

1062
01:15:10,257 --> 01:15:12,301
How naïve can you get?

1063
01:15:12,384 --> 01:15:15,971
This conversation can do without
your taunts and sarcastic remarks.

1064
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:20,058
You're right. I'm sorry.

1065
01:15:20,142 --> 01:15:21,685
I'm trying.

1066
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:27,316
I'm trying to be as honest as I can,
and it's not exactly easy.

1067
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,829
We've never talked like this before.

1068
01:15:42,706 --> 01:15:47,211
Is it any wonder we're naïve,
insecure and childish?

1069
01:15:48,545 --> 01:15:50,380
What else could we expect?

1070
01:16:05,062 --> 01:16:06,855
You're in a tight spot.

1071
01:16:17,866 --> 01:16:19,451
Come and lie beside me.

1072
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,580
Please.

1073
01:16:37,803 --> 01:16:39,805
I want you to make love to me.

1074
01:16:41,265 --> 01:16:42,766
Please?

1075
01:16:44,768 --> 01:16:46,937
For old times' sake.

1076
01:17:35,652 --> 01:17:37,738
Lie here in my arms.

1077
01:17:40,073 --> 01:17:43,660
We'll fall asleep together.

1078
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:50,334
I don't think I can sleep.

1079
01:17:50,417 --> 01:17:55,130
The best thing would be
to pack my things and leave.

1080
01:17:56,298 --> 01:17:58,508
Lie down and close your eyes.

1081
01:17:59,968 --> 01:18:01,511
You'll doze off.

1082
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:07,059
We need rest.
Tomorrow will be a tough day.

1083
01:18:12,189 --> 01:18:14,608
I'm so goddamn ashamed of myself.

1084
01:18:16,568 --> 01:18:18,362
We'll talk about that later.

1085
01:18:20,614 --> 01:18:22,783
Right now it's just you and me.

1086
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:28,121
We have a few hours left together.

1087
01:21:08,907 --> 01:21:11,284
Would you like to pack
or have breakfast first?

1088
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:13,036
You decide.

1089
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:20,585
- Tea or coffee?
- Tea, please.

1090
01:21:52,534 --> 01:21:54,828
What about your mail?

1091
01:21:54,911 --> 01:21:57,289
I'll send you my address.

1092
01:21:58,123 --> 01:22:00,709
You can forward the important letters

1093
01:22:00,792 --> 01:22:03,837
and pay the bills in the usual way.

1094
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:15,390
The plumber was supposed
to repair the bathroom in town.

1095
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:17,892
Have you called him, or should I do it?

1096
01:22:17,976 --> 01:22:22,022
I figured it might have slipped your mind.

1097
01:22:22,105 --> 01:22:24,399
Should I take care of it
so we get it done?

1098
01:22:24,482 --> 01:22:26,901
The guy is never in when I call.

1099
01:22:26,985 --> 01:22:28,945
I hadn't forgotten about it.

1100
01:22:31,698 --> 01:22:35,368
What about your car?
Will you leave it in the garage?

1101
01:22:35,452 --> 01:22:38,371
I've asked Paula's sister
to take care of it.

1102
01:22:39,873 --> 01:22:43,918
No point letting it sit around,
and she's just moved out of town.

1103
01:22:44,002 --> 01:22:46,004
I understand.

1104
01:22:46,838 --> 01:22:50,967
Could you please
cancel my dentist's appointment?

1105
01:22:55,347 --> 01:23:01,269
What are we going to do
about your father's birthday dinner?

1106
01:23:01,728 --> 01:23:05,523
Please call him and explain.
Would you, please?

1107
01:23:05,607 --> 01:23:07,651
That's almost the worst part.

1108
01:23:09,319 --> 01:23:11,071
Maybe I could write him a letter?

1109
01:23:12,155 --> 01:23:14,574
Do whatever you like.
Just don't forget.

1110
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:17,702
Dealing with our parents will be rough.

1111
01:23:26,127 --> 01:23:29,255
- What should I tell the girls?
- Say whatever you like.

1112
01:23:29,339 --> 01:23:33,968
That you fell in love with someone else
and walked out on us?

1113
01:23:34,052 --> 01:23:37,180
That about covers it.
It also has the advantage of being true.

1114
01:23:37,263 --> 01:23:39,933
I don't expect them to understand.

1115
01:23:40,016 --> 01:23:43,228
I have to leave now to avoid traffic.

1116
01:23:45,063 --> 01:23:48,817
- Good-bye, Marianne. Take care.
- Good-bye.

1117
01:23:51,403 --> 01:23:55,532
- I might be back in a week.
- If only you were!

1118
01:23:59,452 --> 01:24:01,913
We'd make a fresh start.

1119
01:24:02,872 --> 01:24:06,835
We'd throw out our stale old routines.

1120
01:24:07,585 --> 01:24:10,046
We'd talk about the past.

1121
01:24:11,131 --> 01:24:13,842
Figure out where we went wrong.

1122
01:24:13,925 --> 01:24:17,721
You'd hear no accusations from me.

1123
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,557
Johan...

1124
01:24:21,266 --> 01:24:23,601
this all seems so unreal.

1125
01:24:23,685 --> 01:24:25,937
I don't know what to do.

1126
01:24:28,189 --> 01:24:30,608
You're shutting me out.

1127
01:24:31,651 --> 01:24:35,029
Any solution would be better than this.

1128
01:24:35,113 --> 01:24:39,701
Couldn't you promise to come back?
That would tide me over.

1129
01:24:39,784 --> 01:24:43,037
Then you wouldn't be
leaving me without hope.

1130
01:24:44,539 --> 01:24:48,209
Even if you have no intention of returning,
you could say you do.

1131
01:24:48,293 --> 01:24:50,086
I have to go now.

1132
01:26:34,065 --> 01:26:37,819
Fredrik? It's me, Marianne.
Sorry to wake you.

1133
01:26:38,486 --> 01:26:40,154
Is Birgit there?

1134
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:42,740
No, let her sleep.

1135
01:26:44,868 --> 01:26:46,286
So, how are things?

1136
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:50,957
Oh, so you like
quiet mornings on your own.

1137
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,543
Well, I won't keep you.

1138
01:26:54,294 --> 01:26:56,212
It's cloudy here.

1139
01:26:56,296 --> 01:26:58,798
How nice for you.

1140
01:26:59,841 --> 01:27:03,219
Fredrik, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

1141
01:27:08,725 --> 01:27:10,602
I really need to talk.

1142
01:27:11,853 --> 01:27:14,022
You and Birgit are our friends.

1143
01:27:17,483 --> 01:27:18,693
I have to...

1144
01:27:24,073 --> 01:27:26,576
It's all so unreal, Fredrik.

1145
01:27:28,578 --> 01:27:29,954
You see...

1146
01:27:34,876 --> 01:27:37,003
I'm about to burst into tears,

1147
01:27:37,086 --> 01:27:39,672
but crying only makes things worse.

1148
01:27:42,425 --> 01:27:43,968
You see...

1149
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:47,847
Johan has fallen in love
with another woman.

1150
01:27:48,514 --> 01:27:51,684
Her name is Paula,
and they're leaving for Paris today.

1151
01:27:52,477 --> 01:27:55,897
Couldn't you talk to him
and ask him to wait a bit?

1152
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:59,442
Tell him he shouldn't rush off like this.

1153
01:28:05,615 --> 01:28:06,866
What?

1154
01:28:08,451 --> 01:28:10,370
You have talked to him?

1155
01:28:17,543 --> 01:28:18,836
I see.

1156
01:28:23,466 --> 01:28:24,759
I see.

1157
01:28:28,096 --> 01:28:31,099
So, the two of you have known all along.

1158
01:28:35,144 --> 01:28:39,315
You knew, but you never told me?

1159
01:28:41,818 --> 01:28:43,861
And you call yourselves friends?

1160
01:28:44,654 --> 01:28:48,157
How could you be
so goddamned disloyal to me?

1161
01:28:48,241 --> 01:28:50,034
I don't care what you say!

1162
01:28:51,869 --> 01:28:55,164
All those times we've gotten together,

1163
01:28:55,248 --> 01:28:59,127
and neither of you said a word!

1164
01:29:00,628 --> 01:29:02,171
Damn you!

1165
01:29:02,755 --> 01:29:05,174
What kind of friends are you anyway?

1166
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:08,344
To hell with your reasons!

1167
01:29:10,263 --> 01:29:14,517
How many others already know?
I'd really like to know that!

1168
01:29:15,893 --> 01:29:17,770
Lots of people. I see.

1169
01:29:18,312 --> 01:29:19,897
That's good to know!

1170
01:29:40,418 --> 01:29:44,714
THE VALE OF TEARS

1171
01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:59,645
Please come in.

1172
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:03,399
You look nice.
That's a pretty blouse.

1173
01:30:03,483 --> 01:30:04,692
You think so?

1174
01:30:04,776 --> 01:30:09,822
I bought it a few weeks ago,
but I'm afraid it's too girlish for me.

1175
01:30:09,906 --> 01:30:11,657
You look great.

1176
01:30:12,241 --> 01:30:16,079
Take your coat off. Standing here
in the hall makes me nervous.

1177
01:30:17,413 --> 01:30:19,082
I feel nervous too.

1178
01:30:19,916 --> 01:30:22,043
I haven't been able to get much done today.

1179
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:27,256
It's silly, but it's been more than six months
since I've seen you.

1180
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:30,343
- How come you suddenly...
- Paula's in London for a week.

1181
01:30:33,137 --> 01:30:36,891
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, please. I'd love a whiskey.

1182
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:42,730
Straight. It settles the stomach.
Calms you down.

1183
01:30:42,814 --> 01:30:46,109
- You like whiskey nowadays?
- Yes, imagine that.

1184
01:30:49,487 --> 01:30:50,947
Cheers.

1185
01:30:53,407 --> 01:30:59,038
Aunt Berit's looking after the girls,
to everyone's mutual delight.

1186
01:30:59,747 --> 01:31:03,876
They're going to the theater,
and then to the country tomorrow.

1187
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,545
That's convenient.

1188
01:31:05,628 --> 01:31:08,297
I mean, it might have been
awkward seeing the kids.

1189
01:31:08,381 --> 01:31:12,301
- How are they doing?
- Don't ask just to be polite.

1190
01:31:12,385 --> 01:31:17,140
But please don't forget
their birthdays again.

1191
01:31:18,266 --> 01:31:22,395
I bought them presents from you,
but they weren't fooled.

1192
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:28,109
Couldn't you take them out to dinner
or to the movies?

1193
01:31:29,235 --> 01:31:32,029
It's awful the way you never
get in touch with them.

1194
01:31:32,113 --> 01:31:35,408
- They hardly ever mention you anymore.
- That's understandable.

1195
01:31:37,493 --> 01:31:40,371
Can't Paula let you see us
without starting a fight?

1196
01:31:40,454 --> 01:31:42,832
If you're going to start with that,
I'd better leave.

1197
01:31:42,915 --> 01:31:44,917
You've said yourself
that she's insanely jealous.

1198
01:31:45,001 --> 01:31:46,752
What am I supposed to do?

1199
01:31:46,836 --> 01:31:49,714
Are you such a coward
that you can't stand up to her?

1200
01:31:49,797 --> 01:31:51,132
Yes.

1201
01:31:54,177 --> 01:31:55,761
I'm sorry.

1202
01:31:57,930 --> 01:31:59,140
That's all right.

1203
01:31:59,223 --> 01:32:01,809
I know you find the situation absurd,

1204
01:32:02,518 --> 01:32:05,354
but scolding won't do any good.

1205
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:10,067
- Would you like some more whiskey?
- Yes, please.

1206
01:32:17,533 --> 01:32:19,368
How are things, Johan?

1207
01:32:21,787 --> 01:32:23,372
Pretty much as usual.

1208
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:26,042
And you?

1209
01:32:26,667 --> 01:32:29,420
I can't complain, I guess.
Could be worse.

1210
01:32:33,549 --> 01:32:36,636
It was silly of me to suggest this.

1211
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:39,472
We can't seem to talk
without hurting each other.

1212
01:32:42,058 --> 01:32:45,770
I have an excellent suggestion:
Let's have dinner.

1213
01:32:45,853 --> 01:32:49,523
We're probably both starving
and that's why we're so touchy.

1214
01:32:49,607 --> 01:32:51,192
That's an excellent suggestion.

1215
01:33:11,254 --> 01:33:13,923
You look funny in that haircut...

1216
01:33:15,591 --> 01:33:17,969
and you've put on some weight.

1217
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:22,640
You really turn me on.

1218
01:33:22,723 --> 01:33:26,519
- What should we do about that?
- We'll see after dinner.

1219
01:33:29,939 --> 01:33:30,982
This wine is nice.

1220
01:33:31,065 --> 01:33:32,692
It's nothing special.

1221
01:33:32,775 --> 01:33:37,113
Just an inexpensive claret, but it's good.

1222
01:33:37,196 --> 01:33:40,616
I don't mind telling you
things are going pretty well for me.

1223
01:33:41,492 --> 01:33:45,288
I've been offered a chair
at Cleveland University for three years.

1224
01:33:45,371 --> 01:33:46,372
Really?

1225
01:33:46,455 --> 01:33:50,334
It's a great opportunity.
Both financially and career-wise.

1226
01:33:50,835 --> 01:33:53,170
That's where things
are happening in my field.

1227
01:33:54,588 --> 01:34:00,052
And I'll be glad to emigrate.
There's nothing to keep me here.

1228
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:03,764
I'm fed up with this academic backwater.

1229
01:34:03,848 --> 01:34:07,018
And I have no desire to go on
being fleeced by the tax man.

1230
01:34:07,101 --> 01:34:09,437
So I'll be leaving this spring, if all goes well.

1231
01:34:11,897 --> 01:34:13,065
Congratulations.

1232
01:34:14,025 --> 01:34:17,236
Here I am, going on about myself.
But I'm in such a good mood.

1233
01:34:19,613 --> 01:34:23,200
Then perhaps we could discuss our divorce?

1234
01:34:23,284 --> 01:34:27,413
If you're going abroad,
we might as well get the ball rolling.

1235
01:34:27,496 --> 01:34:29,373
- What do you think?
- As you like.

1236
01:34:30,041 --> 01:34:32,251
I'd like us to file for divorce.

1237
01:34:32,335 --> 01:34:35,254
You never know.
I might want to remarry.

1238
01:34:35,338 --> 01:34:37,965
And things would be complicated
if you're in the States.

1239
01:34:38,049 --> 01:34:39,842
You have someone in mind?

1240
01:34:41,886 --> 01:34:43,220
Maybe I do.

1241
01:34:44,305 --> 01:34:48,517
Come on, tell me more.
It'll keep me from rattling on.

1242
01:34:51,145 --> 01:34:52,605
Would you like some more?

1243
01:34:53,356 --> 01:34:56,484
No, thanks. And stop being evasive.

1244
01:34:58,319 --> 01:35:00,154
How are things?

1245
01:35:00,237 --> 01:35:01,739
Judging by your appearance

1246
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:06,369
and your attitude,
they must be pretty good.

1247
01:35:07,495 --> 01:35:11,082
I'm curious. Do you have a lover?

1248
01:35:11,832 --> 01:35:15,378
I'll get the coffee.
You do want coffee, right?

1249
01:35:17,546 --> 01:35:18,714
Yes, please.

1250
01:35:56,877 --> 01:36:00,005
Sounds like you're disappointed.

1251
01:36:04,802 --> 01:36:06,512
That's just your imagination.

1252
01:36:13,686 --> 01:36:16,897
You should know
I think about you all the time.

1253
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:22,611
Wondering if you're all right,
or if you're afraid or lonely.

1254
01:36:25,114 --> 01:36:27,575
Every day, several times a day,

1255
01:36:28,784 --> 01:36:32,621
I wonder what I did
to cause the breach between us.

1256
01:36:34,665 --> 01:36:39,670
I know it's a childish way of thinking,
but there you are.

1257
01:36:43,424 --> 01:36:45,092
What did I do wrong?

1258
01:36:47,011 --> 01:36:49,555
Why not ask a psychiatrist?

1259
01:36:50,473 --> 01:36:54,894
I see one several times a week.

1260
01:36:55,561 --> 01:36:58,022
Sometimes we meet in private.

1261
01:36:58,105 --> 01:36:59,648
Is he your lover?

1262
01:37:00,816 --> 01:37:04,195
We did have sex a few times,
but it was no good.

1263
01:37:04,278 --> 01:37:07,072
So we stopped that

1264
01:37:07,156 --> 01:37:10,201
and devoted ourselves to my soul instead.

1265
01:37:11,535 --> 01:37:13,787
What have you learned?

1266
01:37:14,997 --> 01:37:16,373
Nothing.

1267
01:37:17,416 --> 01:37:19,960
Basically, I'm learning to talk.

1268
01:37:21,212 --> 01:37:25,549
And I threw your things out of the study
and moved mine in.

1269
01:37:26,509 --> 01:37:31,639
It left me feeling guilty, but awfully bold.

1270
01:37:32,223 --> 01:37:35,059
Well, it led to something then.

1271
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,272
What an enormous yawn.

1272
01:37:40,356 --> 01:37:42,775
Sorry. It's the wine.

1273
01:37:42,858 --> 01:37:47,363
And I haven't slept well.
I've been so tense.

1274
01:37:47,446 --> 01:37:49,365
If you'd like to go, feel free.

1275
01:37:49,448 --> 01:37:51,951
Don't make a big deal out of it.

1276
01:37:52,034 --> 01:37:55,496
You can take a nap if you like.
I'll wake you in an hour.

1277
01:37:55,579 --> 01:37:58,123
So much fuss about a yawn.

1278
01:37:58,207 --> 01:38:02,336
I don't want to sleep.
I want to hear about your inner quest.

1279
01:38:02,419 --> 01:38:04,630
That's much more interesting,
I promise you.

1280
01:38:04,713 --> 01:38:06,715
There's not much to tell.

1281
01:38:07,216 --> 01:38:09,802
Though something funny did strike me,

1282
01:38:09,885 --> 01:38:12,638
but I haven't told my therapist yet.

1283
01:38:12,721 --> 01:38:14,348
That sounds exciting.

1284
01:38:15,391 --> 01:38:18,978
My therapist told me to jot down
everything that pops into my head.

1285
01:38:19,061 --> 01:38:21,272
No matter how irrelevant.

1286
01:38:21,355 --> 01:38:24,858
Thoughts, memories, dreams.

1287
01:38:24,942 --> 01:38:28,779
I haven't written much so far.
I'm not used to writing.

1288
01:38:28,862 --> 01:38:33,993
It generally turns out stilted
and kind of silly.

1289
01:38:34,076 --> 01:38:36,620
Why don't you read me
what you wrote last night?

1290
01:38:36,704 --> 01:38:39,164
I'd really like to hear it.

1291
01:38:39,248 --> 01:38:43,043
Would you really like to hear it?
Are you sure?

1292
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:47,298
I'll just go get my notebook.

1293
01:38:47,381 --> 01:38:50,175
I wrote for hours on end, you know.

1294
01:38:50,259 --> 01:38:52,720
I was up until 3:00,

1295
01:38:52,803 --> 01:38:55,139
so I looked like the dickens
this morning.

1296
01:38:55,222 --> 01:38:59,101
It figures that would happen
the night before I see you.

1297
01:39:03,731 --> 01:39:05,983
You look so pretty.

1298
01:39:06,817 --> 01:39:09,445
So terribly pretty, Marianne.

1299
01:39:09,528 --> 01:39:14,116
No compliments, please.
Take an interest in my soul instead.

1300
01:39:15,868 --> 01:39:17,453
Go sit down.

1301
01:39:26,629 --> 01:39:28,213
Go sit down.

1302
01:39:30,799 --> 01:39:32,092
Don't.

1303
01:39:33,344 --> 01:39:35,763
No. Please.

1304
01:39:36,472 --> 01:39:39,058
Let me read to you instead.

1305
01:39:39,141 --> 01:39:41,810
One good thing needn't exclude the other.

1306
01:39:43,812 --> 01:39:46,106
I've been thinking about this all this time.

1307
01:39:46,190 --> 01:39:49,902
About having sex with you.

1308
01:39:49,985 --> 01:39:52,071
I've been longing for you.

1309
01:39:53,072 --> 01:39:56,033
But after you leave,

1310
01:39:57,284 --> 01:40:00,162
I'd be left with my longing,
and I don't want that.

1311
01:40:04,625 --> 01:40:07,378
Don't you realize I'm in love with you?

1312
01:40:08,962 --> 01:40:11,674
Sometimes I hate you
for what you did to me.

1313
01:40:13,008 --> 01:40:17,012
Sometimes I don't think of you for hours,
and it's heaven.

1314
01:40:19,682 --> 01:40:23,102
I have everything I could want.
I have my friends, even lovers.

1315
01:40:23,185 --> 01:40:28,691
There's the kids and my job
that I enjoy and am good at.

1316
01:40:31,944 --> 01:40:33,862
Yet I'm bound to you.

1317
01:40:34,321 --> 01:40:36,115
I don't know why.

1318
01:40:38,033 --> 01:40:40,953
Maybe I'm a masochist,

1319
01:40:41,578 --> 01:40:46,667
or the kind of woman
who can only ever love one man.

1320
01:40:48,043 --> 01:40:49,795
I don't know.

1321
01:40:51,547 --> 01:40:53,257
It's so hard, Johan.

1322
01:40:56,218 --> 01:40:59,012
I don't want to live with anyone but you.

1323
01:41:09,022 --> 01:41:11,150
Other men bore me.

1324
01:41:13,652 --> 01:41:16,780
I'm not trying to make you feel guilty...

1325
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:21,577
or blackmail you emotionally.

1326
01:41:23,662 --> 01:41:25,748
I'm just telling you how I feel.

1327
01:41:28,625 --> 01:41:32,087
That's why I can't bear you kissing me

1328
01:41:32,838 --> 01:41:34,757
and making love to me.

1329
01:41:35,883 --> 01:41:38,719
I can't explain it any other way.

1330
01:41:39,636 --> 01:41:41,764
Because you'll walk away,

1331
01:41:42,473 --> 01:41:44,850
and I'll be left longing for you.

1332
01:41:46,727 --> 01:41:52,566
I've sort of enjoyed having you at a distance.

1333
01:41:53,942 --> 01:41:56,695
So let's keep our hands to ourselves.

1334
01:41:57,446 --> 01:42:00,741
You'll just leave me devastated.

1335
01:42:05,204 --> 01:42:07,206
I'm still in love with you.

1336
01:42:08,957 --> 01:42:11,043
Why say that when it isn't true?

1337
01:42:11,126 --> 01:42:14,671
Don't you think I've longed for you?

1338
01:42:15,464 --> 01:42:18,884
I have. We were good together.

1339
01:42:19,718 --> 01:42:23,931
We were friends. We had fun.

1340
01:42:24,681 --> 01:42:27,226
If we feel like having sex,
why shouldn't we?

1341
01:42:27,309 --> 01:42:29,978
It only shows we still long for each other.

1342
01:42:30,062 --> 01:42:33,023
Why have all these reservations?

1343
01:42:33,106 --> 01:42:35,609
Why worry about tomorrow?

1344
01:42:35,692 --> 01:42:38,195
No, Johan.

1345
01:42:39,154 --> 01:42:40,906
Johan, I don't want to.

1346
01:42:41,448 --> 01:42:43,408
I want you to stop it!

1347
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:48,247
I don't want to pine
and weep and long for you.

1348
01:42:48,330 --> 01:42:51,834
Please understand.
This is how it really is.

1349
01:42:52,835 --> 01:42:56,338
It's no good. If you're going to persist,
you might as well leave.

1350
01:42:56,421 --> 01:43:01,260
I don't want to sleep with you.
Please try to understand.

1351
01:43:07,224 --> 01:43:10,477
I'm trying to understand, but I can't.

1352
01:43:23,323 --> 01:43:26,034
Look, I'll just sit here.

1353
01:43:29,037 --> 01:43:33,375
I'll sit here and you can read to me.

1354
01:43:34,543 --> 01:43:40,215
Then I'll go home and call Paula
and say I've been to the theater.

1355
01:43:57,608 --> 01:43:59,860
May I have some more coffee?

1356
01:44:33,602 --> 01:44:36,104
I feel terribly foolish.

1357
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:41,318
I just want to hide somewhere and cry.

1358
01:44:44,905 --> 01:44:46,114
Well...

1359
01:44:47,324 --> 01:44:50,118
if you like, I could leave now.

1360
01:44:50,202 --> 01:44:52,204
We could have dinner tomorrow.

1361
01:44:52,287 --> 01:44:54,331
Perhaps that would be better.

1362
01:44:54,831 --> 01:44:57,292
No, stay after all.

1363
01:44:58,085 --> 01:45:00,170
I'm busy tomorrow.

1364
01:45:04,967 --> 01:45:06,510
- Hi there.
- Hi.

1365
01:45:10,055 --> 01:45:12,307
I really, really like you.

1366
01:45:14,351 --> 01:45:16,478
And I'm acting like a child.

1367
01:45:17,104 --> 01:45:18,605
Everything's all right.

1368
01:45:19,356 --> 01:45:21,441
The situation's under control.

1369
01:45:23,193 --> 01:45:25,862
We've pulled through the crisis.

1370
01:45:30,742 --> 01:45:34,162
I can barely read my own writing.

1371
01:45:36,164 --> 01:45:38,667
The beginning isn't important.

1372
01:45:41,086 --> 01:45:45,549
"Yesterday I was seized by a reckless gaiety.

1373
01:45:45,632 --> 01:45:50,012
For the first time this year
I felt a zest for life,

1374
01:45:50,470 --> 01:45:54,057
eager to know what the day might bring."

1375
01:45:54,933 --> 01:45:56,268
And so on.

1376
01:45:56,351 --> 01:45:57,519
Right.

1377
01:45:58,645 --> 01:45:59,938
Here it is.

1378
01:46:03,525 --> 01:46:09,573
"Suddenly I turned and looked
at an old school picture

1379
01:46:09,656 --> 01:46:11,324
from back when I was ten.

1380
01:46:12,284 --> 01:46:18,331
I seemed to detect something
that had eluded me up to then.

1381
01:46:19,791 --> 01:46:22,085
To my surprise I must admit

1382
01:46:24,463 --> 01:46:27,424
that I don't know who I am.

1383
01:46:28,842 --> 01:46:30,886
I haven't the vaguest idea.

1384
01:46:32,387 --> 01:46:35,766
I've always done as I was told.

1385
01:46:37,309 --> 01:46:39,394
As far as I can remember

1386
01:46:39,478 --> 01:46:41,396
I've been obedient,

1387
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:42,939
well-adjusted,

1388
01:46:43,023 --> 01:46:44,691
almost meek.

1389
01:46:46,109 --> 01:46:51,990
I did assert myself once or twice as a girl,

1390
01:46:53,075 --> 01:46:58,830
but Mother punished
any lapses from convention

1391
01:46:58,914 --> 01:47:01,458
with exemplary severity.

1392
01:47:03,043 --> 01:47:06,797
My entire upbringing,
and that of my sisters,

1393
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:10,884
was aimed at making us agreeable.

1394
01:47:12,177 --> 01:47:15,388
I was ugly and awkward,

1395
01:47:15,472 --> 01:47:18,767
a fact I was constantly reminded of.

1396
01:47:20,393 --> 01:47:25,440
I later realized
that if I kept my thoughts to myself,

1397
01:47:25,941 --> 01:47:29,820
and was ingratiating and predictable,

1398
01:47:30,445 --> 01:47:33,365
my behavior yielded rewards.

1399
01:47:35,283 --> 01:47:40,288
The most momentous deception
began at puberty.

1400
01:47:41,998 --> 01:47:47,712
All my thoughts, feelings
and actions revolved around sex.

1401
01:47:47,796 --> 01:47:53,051
But this I never told my parents.

1402
01:47:53,135 --> 01:47:55,720
Or anyone at all, for that matter.

1403
01:47:57,180 --> 01:48:01,601
Being deceitful and secretive

1404
01:48:01,685 --> 01:48:04,604
became second nature to me.

1405
01:48:06,189 --> 01:48:09,609
My father wanted me to follow
in his footsteps and become a lawyer.

1406
01:48:10,277 --> 01:48:14,865
I dropped hints
that I wanted to be an actress,

1407
01:48:14,948 --> 01:48:19,244
or do something else
in the world of theater.

1408
01:48:20,579 --> 01:48:22,998
But they laughed at me.

1409
01:48:23,081 --> 01:48:26,209
Since then I go on pretending,

1410
01:48:27,169 --> 01:48:30,338
faking my relationships with others,

1411
01:48:30,422 --> 01:48:32,299
with men,

1412
01:48:33,175 --> 01:48:35,927
always putting on an act

1413
01:48:36,011 --> 01:48:39,931
in a desperate attempt to please.

1414
01:48:41,183 --> 01:48:44,644
I've never considered what I want,

1415
01:48:45,395 --> 01:48:46,897
but only,

1416
01:48:47,522 --> 01:48:50,483
'What does he want me to want?'

1417
01:48:52,569 --> 01:48:56,948
It's not unselfishness,
as I used to believe.

1418
01:48:57,032 --> 01:48:59,242
It's sheer cowardice.

1419
01:48:59,326 --> 01:49:00,619
Even worse,

1420
01:49:00,702 --> 01:49:04,873
it stems from my being
ignorant of who I am.

1421
01:49:04,956 --> 01:49:10,545
Our mistake was that we never
broke free from our families

1422
01:49:10,629 --> 01:49:16,426
to create something worthwhile
on our own terms."

1423
01:49:56,883 --> 01:49:59,010
Oh, darn, I fell asleep.

1424
01:49:59,094 --> 01:50:02,097
And your words were so interesting too.

1425
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:03,765
Forgive me.

1426
01:50:04,724 --> 01:50:10,105
Could you go on?
That is, if I haven't offended you.

1427
01:50:10,605 --> 01:50:13,191
I think you should go home
and get some sleep.

1428
01:50:14,067 --> 01:50:16,695
I'm not offended. Really.

1429
01:50:16,778 --> 01:50:19,531
Yeah, I guess I should go.

1430
01:50:24,411 --> 01:50:26,538
Please keep in touch,

1431
01:50:26,621 --> 01:50:28,665
if only for the children's sake.

1432
01:50:28,748 --> 01:50:30,500
Of course.

1433
01:50:31,126 --> 01:50:33,378
You're always welcome here.

1434
01:50:33,461 --> 01:50:35,880
If only Paula wasn't so jealous.

1435
01:50:36,631 --> 01:50:39,342
But I guess she feels justified.
It's hard on her too.

1436
01:50:40,552 --> 01:50:42,470
When will you know about the US?

1437
01:50:42,554 --> 01:50:44,889
In a month or so.

1438
01:50:44,973 --> 01:50:46,933
Let me know how it goes.

1439
01:50:47,017 --> 01:50:48,893
I'll call or write.

1440
01:50:49,811 --> 01:50:53,815
We need to decide about the divorce.

1441
01:50:54,607 --> 01:50:57,652
- Do you want to marry again?
- I don't know.

1442
01:50:58,278 --> 01:51:01,281
I'd rather wait.

1443
01:51:01,364 --> 01:51:02,949
What do you think?

1444
01:51:03,033 --> 01:51:05,243
I'm not sure what I think.

1445
01:51:40,028 --> 01:51:42,572
You will stay tonight, won't you?

1446
01:51:42,655 --> 01:51:44,783
Yes, I'll stay.

1447
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:16,147
How do you feel?

1448
01:52:16,231 --> 01:52:17,690
Frightened.

1449
01:52:19,651 --> 01:52:21,361
How about mustering up some courage?

1450
01:52:21,444 --> 01:52:23,530
Some courage?

1451
01:52:56,312 --> 01:52:57,981
What is it? Can't you sleep?

1452
01:52:58,064 --> 01:52:59,566
Not a chance.

1453
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:03,736
I feel miserable.
I'd better go home. Forgive me.

1454
01:53:34,642 --> 01:53:37,896
- That's Paula's handwriting.
- She wrote to me.

1455
01:53:37,979 --> 01:53:41,941
- What's she up to now?
- She sent this before she left.

1456
01:53:42,025 --> 01:53:43,693
You should read it.

1457
01:53:44,319 --> 01:53:46,154
Read it here.

1458
01:53:53,495 --> 01:53:57,123
"Dear Marianne, I suspect
you're surprised to get a letter from me.

1459
01:53:57,207 --> 01:54:00,502
I assure you
there's no ulterior motive behind this letter.

1460
01:54:01,336 --> 01:54:04,464
I took this job in London
to get away for a week

1461
01:54:04,547 --> 01:54:08,176
and thereby break a vicious cycle
of jealousy and suspicion.

1462
01:54:09,177 --> 01:54:13,056
I know Johan will contact you
the minute I've gone.

1463
01:54:13,139 --> 01:54:14,891
I only have myself to blame,

1464
01:54:14,974 --> 01:54:18,061
as I've kept him
from seeing you and the children.

1465
01:54:18,978 --> 01:54:22,774
If only it were possible to put things right."

1466
01:54:22,857 --> 01:54:25,527
Isn't that typical of Paula.

1467
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:28,071
She wants us to be friends.

1468
01:54:28,154 --> 01:54:31,032
She can't stand this hostility.

1469
01:54:31,115 --> 01:54:33,952
How touching... particularly
the fact that you believe her.

1470
01:54:39,916 --> 01:54:42,794
"Johan is the gentlest, kindest,

1471
01:54:42,877 --> 01:54:45,880
most affectionate person I've ever met.

1472
01:54:46,464 --> 01:54:49,342
He has no self-confidence at all,

1473
01:54:49,425 --> 01:54:53,888
though he tries to put up
a brave and cheerful front."

1474
01:54:57,016 --> 01:55:01,271
You can say anything about anyone.
It always fits in some respect.

1475
01:55:48,943 --> 01:55:50,445
THE ILLITERATES

1476
01:55:50,528 --> 01:55:51,988
Come on in.

1477
01:55:52,822 --> 01:55:57,201
I'm glad we could meet
here at your office.

1478
01:55:57,285 --> 01:55:58,703
Saves us some time.

1479
01:55:58,786 --> 01:56:00,538
It's not exactly cozy.

1480
01:56:00,622 --> 01:56:04,125
But it's fine for divorce matters.

1481
01:56:04,208 --> 01:56:05,752
Look at this.

1482
01:56:05,835 --> 01:56:10,632
Here's the agreement,
word for word as we decided.

1483
01:56:10,715 --> 01:56:14,969
- Then I don't need to read it.
- Never sign what you haven't read.

1484
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:18,514
- Don't look so grumpy.
- I'm not grumpy.

1485
01:56:18,598 --> 01:56:20,892
You're as grumpy as can be.

1486
01:56:20,975 --> 01:56:27,065
Here's a list of our common property
and its distribution.

1487
01:56:27,148 --> 01:56:30,777
It's just a list.
It doesn't require a signature.

1488
01:56:46,834 --> 01:56:50,922
You get Granny's clock?
That must be a mistake.

1489
01:56:52,882 --> 01:56:56,427
Your grandmother gave it to me.
We've already discussed this.

1490
01:56:56,511 --> 01:56:58,930
I don't recall discussing Granny's clock.

1491
01:56:59,013 --> 01:57:03,768
If you're so attached to it, keep it,
but it happens to be mine.

1492
01:57:03,851 --> 01:57:06,354
You're always right, aren't you?
Take the clock.

1493
01:57:06,437 --> 01:57:08,439
I'm not going to squabble over trifles.

1494
01:57:08,523 --> 01:57:12,068
Make sure I haven't fleeced you
out of anything else.

1495
01:57:12,151 --> 01:57:15,947
Your sarcasm is wasted on me.
I have such a miserable cold.

1496
01:57:16,656 --> 01:57:20,284
How about a glass of fine old brandy?

1497
01:57:20,368 --> 01:57:23,037
Sounds good.

1498
01:57:23,121 --> 01:57:25,206
Egerman gave me a bottle.

1499
01:57:25,289 --> 01:57:30,503
Some grateful Parisian colleagues
gave him a whole case.

1500
01:57:32,046 --> 01:57:33,214
Cheers.

1501
01:57:37,885 --> 01:57:41,472
Not bad, huh? I like it.

1502
01:57:43,057 --> 01:57:47,645
I don't care for brandy as a rule,
but this is very nice.

1503
01:57:47,729 --> 01:57:50,189
I feel better already.

1504
01:57:57,697 --> 01:58:00,074
- It's hard.
- What's hard?

1505
01:58:00,158 --> 01:58:02,493
- Getting divorced.
- It's just paperwork.

1506
01:58:02,577 --> 01:58:04,829
I still think it's hard.

1507
01:58:04,912 --> 01:58:08,833
We've been living apart for ages,
we rarely see each other,

1508
01:58:08,916 --> 01:58:10,543
we've both agreed to it,

1509
01:58:10,626 --> 01:58:12,962
but I still feel guilty.

1510
01:58:14,630 --> 01:58:16,257
It's strange.

1511
01:58:19,093 --> 01:58:20,970
It's strange.

1512
01:58:21,429 --> 01:58:22,930
So it is.

1513
01:58:23,014 --> 01:58:25,516
On my way over, I was in a good mood.

1514
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:30,146
I was determined not to cry
or be affected by it all.

1515
01:58:30,229 --> 01:58:32,023
You said you felt guilty.

1516
01:58:35,276 --> 01:58:38,446
Let's go sit over on the couch instead.

1517
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:42,325
And put the lights out.
The glare is ghastly.

1518
01:58:43,075 --> 01:58:46,954
How can you work in such a bleak room?

1519
01:58:47,038 --> 01:58:49,081
The couch isn't comfortable either.

1520
01:58:49,165 --> 01:58:52,460
It's fine if you put your feet up.

1521
01:58:53,628 --> 01:58:57,381
- More brandy?
- Yes, please.

1522
01:59:00,468 --> 01:59:02,804
- Comfy?
- Yes.

1523
01:59:05,932 --> 01:59:08,643
Is this building empty tonight?

1524
01:59:08,726 --> 01:59:12,146
- There's a night watchman.
- How nice.

1525
01:59:12,230 --> 01:59:13,898
What's nice about it?

1526
01:59:13,981 --> 01:59:16,067
I don't know.
It's just nice, that's all.

1527
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:18,069
Nothing's nice when you're sick.

1528
01:59:18,152 --> 01:59:22,156
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
It's not like it's terminal.

1529
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:28,120
This gets better and better.

1530
01:59:28,204 --> 01:59:30,081
You really are in a good mood.

1531
01:59:30,164 --> 01:59:31,541
Yes, I am.

1532
01:59:32,792 --> 01:59:35,419
To be honest, I'm in love.

1533
01:59:35,503 --> 01:59:37,463
With that David person?

1534
01:59:38,089 --> 01:59:41,259
- No, that's over.
- Really?

1535
01:59:41,342 --> 01:59:44,512
Don't worry about that.
Give me a kiss.

1536
01:59:44,595 --> 01:59:46,013
I've got a cold.

1537
01:59:46,097 --> 01:59:49,976
I never catch your germs.
So give me a kiss. I want you to.

1538
02:00:19,547 --> 02:00:21,299
Was it what you expected?

1539
02:00:21,382 --> 02:00:22,925
Much better.

1540
02:00:23,759 --> 02:00:26,554
Now put your hand on my breast.

1541
02:00:27,638 --> 02:00:31,100
- Are you seducing me?
- That's right.

1542
02:00:32,351 --> 02:00:37,106
Right here on the carpet, right now.

1543
02:00:38,190 --> 02:00:40,526
Doesn't that sound like fun?

1544
02:00:41,736 --> 02:00:45,406
You look suspicious.
Afraid of the night watchman?

1545
02:00:45,489 --> 02:00:47,867
After all, we're still married.

1546
02:00:53,247 --> 02:00:56,083
Come lie on top of me.

1547
02:01:01,964 --> 02:01:05,509
People should make love
on the floor more often.

1548
02:01:08,554 --> 02:01:11,641
- Lock the door.
- No one will walk in on us.

1549
02:01:11,724 --> 02:01:15,144
You never know.
I'm kind of a prude. Lock the door.

1550
02:01:15,227 --> 02:01:17,939
- Just in case the watchman comes.
- Right.

1551
02:01:18,606 --> 02:01:20,107
Hurry up.

1552
02:01:20,733 --> 02:01:24,528
- He might be eavesdropping.
- No, it's time for his rounds.

1553
02:01:24,612 --> 02:01:27,698
Is it wise to take your slacks off
with a cold like that?

1554
02:01:27,782 --> 02:01:32,119
- You can keep me warm.
- So you don't freeze your thing off.

1555
02:01:38,876 --> 02:01:43,756
Poor baby, you're so miserable.

1556
02:01:44,465 --> 02:01:48,219
Kiss me.
I enjoy being kissed by you.

1557
02:02:15,329 --> 02:02:16,747
Close your eyes

1558
02:02:17,498 --> 02:02:20,001
or I'll feel self-conscious.

1559
02:02:25,006 --> 02:02:27,883
Now put your hands on my hips.

1560
02:02:28,509 --> 02:02:31,595
Good. That's nice.

1561
02:02:35,683 --> 02:02:38,310
What if the watchman walked in now?

1562
02:02:39,854 --> 02:02:44,525
He could join us. We're liberated.

1563
02:02:48,446 --> 02:02:51,032
Let's stay here all night...

1564
02:02:52,450 --> 02:02:57,163
and just drink and make love.

1565
02:03:00,416 --> 02:03:03,878
We'll file our divorce papers tomorrow.

1566
02:03:24,815 --> 02:03:28,486
- A penny for your thoughts.
- My thoughts?

1567
02:03:29,737 --> 02:03:32,490
Wouldn't you like to know.

1568
02:03:32,573 --> 02:03:35,910
- Are you hungry?
- Always.

1569
02:03:37,161 --> 02:03:41,082
What about
some steak tartare and beer?

1570
02:03:41,916 --> 02:03:44,502
You shouldn't be taking me out.

1571
02:03:44,585 --> 02:03:47,588
I'm in Uppsala with my students.

1572
02:03:48,380 --> 02:03:50,007
Poor Paula.

1573
02:03:50,716 --> 02:03:54,595
In that case,
I'd love to have dinner with you.

1574
02:03:56,097 --> 02:03:58,015
Where's the bathroom?

1575
02:03:58,099 --> 02:04:00,142
Down the hall and to the left.

1576
02:04:13,906 --> 02:04:17,368
Let's sign these papers
and go out and celebrate.

1577
02:04:17,451 --> 02:04:20,871
Pay tribute to a long and happy marriage.

1578
02:04:20,955 --> 02:04:24,500
I think I'll take them home
and study them in peace and quiet.

1579
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:29,046
Why the about-face now
after all our talks?

1580
02:04:29,130 --> 02:04:33,342
You told me yourself I should read them.

1581
02:04:33,425 --> 02:04:39,723
Then by all means,
let's read through the whole thing.

1582
02:04:39,807 --> 02:04:42,977
Make sure I haven't cheated you.

1583
02:04:43,060 --> 02:04:44,436
Why are you so upset?

1584
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:47,523
I'm not. Let's start reading.

1585
02:04:47,606 --> 02:04:49,024
You look pissed off to me.

1586
02:04:49,108 --> 02:04:52,903
I am, but I'll control myself.

1587
02:04:52,987 --> 02:04:56,782
Like I always do
when subjected to your whims.

1588
02:04:58,242 --> 02:05:01,579
Let's get off this tedious subject.

1589
02:05:01,662 --> 02:05:05,541
It's late, and tomorrow's a working day.

1590
02:05:05,624 --> 02:05:09,628
- Don't you want to have dinner?
- No, thank you.

1591
02:05:09,712 --> 02:05:13,257
I'm grateful for the favors
already bestowed upon me.

1592
02:05:13,340 --> 02:05:16,010
- Talk about whims.
- Now look here, Johan!

1593
02:05:22,183 --> 02:05:26,145
It's pointless even trying
to discuss this now.

1594
02:05:28,147 --> 02:05:31,358
Let's stuff these into an envelope.

1595
02:05:31,442 --> 02:05:33,444
Then you can take them home,

1596
02:05:34,111 --> 02:05:38,115
and you and Paula
can pore over the wording

1597
02:05:38,199 --> 02:05:41,911
to make sure I haven't screwed you over.

1598
02:05:41,994 --> 02:05:44,496
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

1599
02:06:00,054 --> 02:06:02,431
- We were good friends a minute ago.
- Right.

1600
02:06:03,265 --> 02:06:06,518
By the way, don't forget Eva's birthday.

1601
02:06:06,602 --> 02:06:08,604
Do I usually forget the children's birthdays?

1602
02:06:08,687 --> 02:06:11,732
No, because I always remind you.

1603
02:06:12,399 --> 02:06:16,612
Could you pay for her trip to France?
I can't afford it.

1604
02:06:16,695 --> 02:06:20,491
- How much is it?
- Two thousand kronor.

1605
02:06:20,574 --> 02:06:25,704
Are you out of your mind?
Out of the question!

1606
02:06:25,788 --> 02:06:27,498
Ask your mother to foot the bill.

1607
02:06:27,581 --> 02:06:30,167
I've borrowed too much from her as it is.

1608
02:06:30,251 --> 02:06:35,881
Well, I can't afford it.
I just paid Karin's orthodontist.

1609
02:06:35,965 --> 02:06:40,886
- Doesn't she have free dental care?
- She refuses to go to that clinic.

1610
02:06:40,970 --> 02:06:44,598
Eva will have to cancel her trip.
I don't have any money.

1611
02:06:45,266 --> 02:06:48,936
It won't do her harm
to learn she can't have everything.

1612
02:06:49,478 --> 02:06:52,523
She's too goddamn spoiled.

1613
02:06:52,606 --> 02:06:54,275
And she has no manners.

1614
02:06:54,358 --> 02:06:58,654
Last week she visited my mother
and her behavior was appalling.

1615
02:06:59,571 --> 02:07:04,702
Your mother told you that?
Well, Eva's at a difficult age.

1616
02:07:04,785 --> 02:07:08,122
You'll have to discipline them.
Don't let the girls rule the roost.

1617
02:07:08,205 --> 02:07:09,873
What kind of talk is that?

1618
02:07:09,957 --> 02:07:11,625
They trust me.

1619
02:07:11,709 --> 02:07:15,379
We talk about everything,
and for that I'm grateful.

1620
02:07:15,462 --> 02:07:19,675
I could care less
about petty details like manners.

1621
02:07:19,758 --> 02:07:23,429
Tell her I can't afford the trip.

1622
02:07:23,512 --> 02:07:25,180
Tell her yourself.

1623
02:07:25,264 --> 02:07:27,099
Why? You have custody.

1624
02:07:27,182 --> 02:07:30,894
All I do is fork out huge sums
in child support, which I'm taxed on,

1625
02:07:30,978 --> 02:07:33,188
leaving me high and dry.

1626
02:07:34,898 --> 02:07:41,488
You and I were born
with silver spoons in our mouths.

1627
02:07:42,781 --> 02:07:48,829
We've squandered our resources,
leaving us poor, bitter and angry.

1628
02:07:49,747 --> 02:07:52,082
However trite, it's the truth.

1629
02:07:53,042 --> 02:07:56,670
We're emotional illiterates.

1630
02:07:57,504 --> 02:08:02,259
We've been taught about anatomy
and farming methods in Africa.

1631
02:08:03,010 --> 02:08:07,639
We've learned mathematical formulas
by heart.

1632
02:08:09,016 --> 02:08:12,519
But we haven't been taught a thing
about our souls.

1633
02:08:14,063 --> 02:08:17,816
We're tremendously ignorant
about what makes people tick.

1634
02:08:22,196 --> 02:08:25,824
That signals the end of my lecture.
I had nothing more to say anyway.

1635
02:08:27,201 --> 02:08:32,206
How about some more brandy?
Then we can decide about dinner.

1636
02:08:37,586 --> 02:08:40,255
I don't agree with you, but no matter.

1637
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:46,220
By the way, that job in the US
went down the tubes.

1638
02:08:47,096 --> 02:08:50,557
- Not that it matters.
- That's a shame.

1639
02:08:50,641 --> 02:08:53,769
Well, I was pretty disappointed.

1640
02:08:54,436 --> 02:08:56,980
There was the usual
wheeling and dealing.

1641
02:08:57,564 --> 02:09:00,401
First things were postponed,

1642
02:09:01,235 --> 02:09:03,112
then there was no money,

1643
02:09:03,821 --> 02:09:06,573
and then they sent someone else.

1644
02:09:07,074 --> 02:09:08,617
That's life. Cheers!

1645
02:09:19,711 --> 02:09:22,548
I'll be 45 this summer.

1646
02:09:24,633 --> 02:09:27,594
I can expect to live another 30 years.

1647
02:09:33,517 --> 02:09:36,770
Viewed objectively, I'm dead weight.

1648
02:09:38,439 --> 02:09:44,278
I'll spend the next 20 years
being a damn nuisance.

1649
02:09:46,113 --> 02:09:51,618
I'm an expensive, unproductive unit

1650
02:09:51,702 --> 02:09:54,455
that ought to be eliminated.

1651
02:09:57,624 --> 02:09:59,668
And I'm supposed to be in my prime,

1652
02:10:00,210 --> 02:10:04,047
brimming with experience.

1653
02:10:04,131 --> 02:10:07,009
But it's, "Throw the loser out.

1654
02:10:07,551 --> 02:10:10,762
Let him rot!"

1655
02:10:18,896 --> 02:10:23,108
I'm so goddamn tired.

1656
02:10:29,907 --> 02:10:31,992
I hardly know who I am.

1657
02:10:36,580 --> 02:10:40,125
Someone spat on me
and now I'm drowning in the spittle.

1658
02:10:41,001 --> 02:10:42,669
Am I boring you?

1659
02:10:43,670 --> 02:10:46,173
- It's funny.
- What's funny?

1660
02:10:47,216 --> 02:10:50,844
I wanted to have sex with you today

1661
02:10:50,928 --> 02:10:53,305
to see if I felt anything.

1662
02:10:54,097 --> 02:10:57,518
All I felt was lukewarm affection.

1663
02:10:59,853 --> 02:11:04,024
You know what?
I think I'm breaking free at last.

1664
02:11:05,234 --> 02:11:07,861
It's taken a long time
and it's been very painful,

1665
02:11:09,154 --> 02:11:12,783
but I'm free of you now
to start living my own life,

1666
02:11:12,866 --> 02:11:14,826
and that feels absolutely wonderful.

1667
02:11:15,285 --> 02:11:17,621
Allow me to congratulate you.

1668
02:11:17,704 --> 02:11:20,040
I don't know why I told you.

1669
02:11:20,707 --> 02:11:24,419
It's callous of me to say it
when you're having such a rough time.

1670
02:11:25,712 --> 02:11:27,839
But oddly enough, I don't care.

1671
02:11:27,923 --> 02:11:31,426
I've taken your feelings into account
far too often.

1672
02:11:31,885 --> 02:11:34,972
Being considerate killed our love.

1673
02:11:37,099 --> 02:11:41,478
If I hadn't let myself
get sidetracked by guilt,

1674
02:11:41,562 --> 02:11:45,232
I'd have known
everything we did was wrong.

1675
02:11:47,484 --> 02:11:49,653
Remember after Karin was born?

1676
02:11:50,571 --> 02:11:53,240
When sex became impossible?

1677
02:11:54,241 --> 02:12:00,038
How we put the blame
on my two pregnancies.

1678
02:12:00,747 --> 02:12:05,502
We concocted so many reasons
why making love gave us no pleasure.

1679
02:12:08,380 --> 02:12:13,760
Warning lights were flashing all around us,

1680
02:12:13,844 --> 02:12:17,097
but we ignored them.

1681
02:12:18,098 --> 02:12:23,937
These postmortems are so pointless.

1682
02:12:28,442 --> 02:12:32,946
Your idiotic sarcasm drives me crazy!

1683
02:12:33,947 --> 02:12:37,409
What gives you the right
to tell me what to think and feel?

1684
02:12:37,993 --> 02:12:40,370
Lord, how I hate you.

1685
02:12:41,663 --> 02:12:43,832
I used to think that quite often.

1686
02:12:44,916 --> 02:12:46,793
"Lord, how I hate her."

1687
02:12:47,794 --> 02:12:49,880
Especially when we made love

1688
02:12:50,964 --> 02:12:53,759
and I felt your indifference.

1689
02:12:55,177 --> 02:12:58,430
And when I saw you naked
at the bidet afterwards,

1690
02:12:58,513 --> 02:13:04,311
washing out the nasty stuff
I'd deposited inside you,

1691
02:13:05,854 --> 02:13:10,442
I'd think, "I hate her body,
the way she moves."

1692
02:13:12,986 --> 02:13:14,821
I should have beaten you.

1693
02:13:16,323 --> 02:13:21,161
I wanted to smash that hard white resistance
that emanated from you.

1694
02:13:22,329 --> 02:13:28,126
But we chatted away and talked
about how well we got along.

1695
02:13:29,044 --> 02:13:32,506
Tell me, why do I enjoy sex now?

1696
02:13:33,882 --> 02:13:35,967
I do everything he asks.

1697
02:13:36,051 --> 02:13:37,260
Just you wait.

1698
02:13:38,261 --> 02:13:43,266
When you're married to him,
everything will repeat itself.

1699
02:13:43,350 --> 02:13:46,395
Just you wait and see.
Your behavior's deeply rooted.

1700
02:13:47,604 --> 02:13:53,402
Then you'll look for a new lover
to free you from your loathing.

1701
02:13:54,236 --> 02:13:55,445
You're wrong.

1702
02:13:57,030 --> 02:14:01,076
There is such a thing as simple affection.

1703
02:14:03,203 --> 02:14:06,289
To say nothing of sensuousness.

1704
02:14:07,457 --> 02:14:09,000
And physical desire.

1705
02:14:10,419 --> 02:14:12,212
In your case, that's all blocked.

1706
02:14:14,881 --> 02:14:19,511
Do you really think I wasn't miserable too?

1707
02:14:21,304 --> 02:14:25,851
I'd think, "Is this how it's supposed to be?"

1708
02:14:27,269 --> 02:14:32,274
We'd console ourselves with the thought
that sex wasn't everything,

1709
02:14:33,150 --> 02:14:35,444
that in other respects we were happy.

1710
02:14:37,821 --> 02:14:40,073
Talk about deluding ourselves.

1711
02:14:40,157 --> 02:14:42,951
You're forgetting certain unpleasant details.

1712
02:14:43,034 --> 02:14:45,704
Be so kind as to refresh my memory.

1713
02:14:45,787 --> 02:14:47,581
You know what you did?

1714
02:14:48,290 --> 02:14:51,084
You cashed in on your sex organs.

1715
02:14:51,877 --> 02:14:53,420
They were a bargaining chip.

1716
02:14:54,212 --> 02:14:57,799
A night of sex for a night of peace.

1717
02:14:58,425 --> 02:15:00,802
Good behavior earned me a lay.

1718
02:15:01,678 --> 02:15:05,307
Bad behavior or criticism

1719
02:15:05,390 --> 02:15:07,684
made you withdraw.

1720
02:15:07,768 --> 02:15:09,895
It was grotesque the way you carried on.

1721
02:15:09,978 --> 02:15:11,605
You were worse than any whore!

1722
02:15:11,688 --> 02:15:14,191
- You would never face the truth!
- What goddamned truth?

1723
02:15:14,274 --> 02:15:17,277
Some sort of female truth, or your truth?

1724
02:15:17,360 --> 02:15:22,282
You're completely out of your mind!
Am I supposed to be a doormat?

1725
02:15:22,741 --> 02:15:25,035
Am I a substitute for your mother?

1726
02:15:25,118 --> 02:15:29,790
All that carping
about how I neglected our home!

1727
02:15:29,873 --> 02:15:35,420
- That's not true!
- Yes, it is. That's all I ever heard!

1728
02:15:35,504 --> 02:15:39,883
You piled the guilt on, you and your parents!

1729
02:15:39,966 --> 02:15:43,136
I felt inadequate at work and at home,

1730
02:15:43,220 --> 02:15:46,890
and I was a washout in bed too.

1731
02:15:46,973 --> 02:15:50,143
I was hedged in
by all the griping and endless demands!

1732
02:15:50,227 --> 02:15:51,812
Goddamn you!

1733
02:15:51,895 --> 02:15:56,733
Was it so strange
that I used sex for leverage?

1734
02:15:57,984 --> 02:16:00,695
I was outnumbered, having to fight you,

1735
02:16:00,779 --> 02:16:05,367
both sets of parents and society!

1736
02:16:05,450 --> 02:16:11,414
When I think about what I endured,
I could scream!

1737
02:16:11,498 --> 02:16:15,836
I tell you this: never again!

1738
02:16:16,545 --> 02:16:21,299
You sit there whining about conspiracies.

1739
02:16:21,383 --> 02:16:24,845
Well, it serves you right!

1740
02:16:24,928 --> 02:16:28,181
I hope you'll have it rammed down your throat

1741
02:16:28,265 --> 02:16:30,600
that you're a useless parasite.

1742
02:16:30,684 --> 02:16:32,561
You're being utterly grotesque!

1743
02:16:32,644 --> 02:16:35,397
So what? That's what I've become!

1744
02:16:37,774 --> 02:16:41,486
The difference between your grotesqueness
and mine is that I won't give in!

1745
02:16:42,195 --> 02:16:46,199
I intend to face reality the way it is.

1746
02:16:47,784 --> 02:16:51,872
If there's one thing I truly appreciate,
it's being alive.

1747
02:16:53,081 --> 02:16:55,750
I enjoy overcoming difficulties.

1748
02:16:55,834 --> 02:16:58,003
I don't ask for any favors...

1749
02:16:58,086 --> 02:16:59,713
Great!

1750
02:16:59,796 --> 02:17:02,299
Then we don't have to
feel sorry for each other.

1751
02:17:02,382 --> 02:17:04,885
We can chuck our guilt out the window.

1752
02:17:06,052 --> 02:17:08,305
We're almost human.

1753
02:17:09,472 --> 02:17:15,061
It's a pity we ever met in the first place
and decided to live together.

1754
02:17:15,645 --> 02:17:17,939
What a glorious fiasco.

1755
02:17:19,190 --> 02:17:22,652
The sooner we sign the papers,
the better.

1756
02:17:22,736 --> 02:17:27,616
We'll divide our worldly goods
and go our separate ways, thank you.

1757
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:32,329
Do you think I don't know
what you're thinking?

1758
02:17:33,204 --> 02:17:34,915
You don't want a divorce!

1759
02:17:34,998 --> 02:17:36,333
That's preposterous!

1760
02:17:36,416 --> 02:17:40,629
Is it? Then prove it
by signing the papers right now!

1761
02:17:40,712 --> 02:17:42,005
All right, I will.

1762
02:17:42,088 --> 02:17:44,466
Johan, be honest now.

1763
02:17:44,549 --> 02:17:46,551
Look at me!

1764
02:17:47,969 --> 02:17:49,804
You've changed your mind.

1765
02:17:49,888 --> 02:17:53,558
You don't want a divorce, do you?
You were going to tell me today, right?

1766
02:17:53,642 --> 02:17:56,478
Would that be such a crime?

1767
02:17:57,354 --> 02:18:00,815
You want to hear me admit that I give up?
Well, I do!

1768
02:18:02,025 --> 02:18:03,860
I'm sick of Paula!

1769
02:18:04,945 --> 02:18:06,905
I want to come home!

1770
02:18:09,366 --> 02:18:12,077
Don't look at me like that.

1771
02:18:18,625 --> 02:18:21,127
I'm a failure. I'm going downhill.

1772
02:18:22,295 --> 02:18:24,255
I'm scared and I have no home.

1773
02:18:28,051 --> 02:18:31,388
This isn't the right time
to ask you to resume our marriage.

1774
02:18:31,471 --> 02:18:33,306
If you think pity will help...

1775
02:18:33,390 --> 02:18:37,268
You asked me,
and I'm giving you a straight answer.

1776
02:18:40,480 --> 02:18:46,027
I was tied to you
more profoundly than I realized.

1777
02:18:48,071 --> 02:18:51,074
I needed our home and family...

1778
02:18:52,784 --> 02:18:55,161
and a regular life to lead.

1779
02:18:58,873 --> 02:19:01,251
- I'm tired of being alone.
- Alone?

1780
02:19:01,334 --> 02:19:04,921
Loneliness with Paula
is worse than being all alone.

1781
02:19:05,505 --> 02:19:07,424
I can't stand either.

1782
02:19:10,677 --> 02:19:12,679
I can't talk about this.

1783
02:19:13,680 --> 02:19:15,348
Now you know everything.

1784
02:19:29,029 --> 02:19:32,240
Please send a cab to Malmrosgatan 45.

1785
02:19:32,323 --> 02:19:34,159
Thank you.

1786
02:19:36,369 --> 02:19:39,873
Want a lift?
You really shouldn't drive.

1787
02:19:39,956 --> 02:19:41,499
I'll stay here a while longer.

1788
02:19:41,583 --> 02:19:44,836
Please don't brood.

1789
02:19:44,919 --> 02:19:47,380
- It's none of your business.
- Come on.

1790
02:19:47,922 --> 02:19:51,217
- I want you to stay.
- I don't want to.

1791
02:19:51,301 --> 02:19:56,222
You're tired and drunk.
Let me go!

1792
02:19:56,723 --> 02:19:58,475
I don't want you to go.

1793
02:19:59,392 --> 02:20:01,728
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Don't be ridiculous yourself.

1794
02:20:02,353 --> 02:20:05,356
We never behaved like this in our marriage.
Let's not start now.

1795
02:20:05,440 --> 02:20:06,691
Give me the key.

1796
02:20:06,775 --> 02:20:08,651
I don't give a damn what you say!

1797
02:20:14,324 --> 02:20:17,243
Now I can see your well-ordered brain
whirling away.

1798
02:20:18,328 --> 02:20:21,915
"What do I do now? Has he gone crazy?

1799
02:20:23,541 --> 02:20:25,168
Is he going to hit me?"

1800
02:20:27,504 --> 02:20:30,882
If you really want to know,
I think you're a riot.

1801
02:20:33,468 --> 02:20:36,012
If I'm such a riot,
why aren't you laughing?

1802
02:20:37,639 --> 02:20:39,599
You look scared to me.

1803
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:43,103
Let me cancel my cab...

1804
02:20:47,524 --> 02:20:48,817
What for?

1805
02:20:51,444 --> 02:20:53,988
They only wait around
for ten minutes or so.

1806
02:20:55,448 --> 02:20:57,117
Just take it easy.

1807
02:20:58,284 --> 02:21:00,578
This will take quite a while.

1808
02:21:02,163 --> 02:21:03,373
Fine.

1809
02:21:04,499 --> 02:21:06,584
- So what do you want to say?
- Nothing.

1810
02:21:10,213 --> 02:21:12,215
I just want to look at you.

1811
02:21:12,298 --> 02:21:13,633
Go ahead.

1812
02:21:15,176 --> 02:21:18,680
I might have expected this
from someone like you.

1813
02:21:19,973 --> 02:21:23,560
I constantly warn women
in the process of a divorce

1814
02:21:23,643 --> 02:21:27,313
against being alone
with their aggrieved husbands.

1815
02:21:29,107 --> 02:21:32,068
I never thought it would happen to me.

1816
02:21:32,152 --> 02:21:33,778
Shut your mouth.

1817
02:21:36,322 --> 02:21:37,949
I'm not afraid.

1818
02:21:39,325 --> 02:21:43,163
I couldn't care less what you do.

1819
02:21:44,330 --> 02:21:47,208
- Shut up!
- You're crazy!

1820
02:22:27,832 --> 02:22:32,629
Give me the key.
I'll go wash off this blood.

1821
02:22:33,296 --> 02:22:34,923
I'm not letting you out.

1822
02:22:36,049 --> 02:22:38,259
You asshole!

1823
02:22:38,343 --> 02:22:42,138
You bitch! I'll show you!

1824
02:22:45,767 --> 02:22:48,394
I could kill you! I could kill you!

1825
02:23:02,742 --> 02:23:05,119
Marianne, are you...

1826
02:23:08,331 --> 02:23:10,750
Hey, are you all right?

1827
02:23:15,088 --> 02:23:18,758
I guess I've only got myself to blame.

1828
02:23:21,511 --> 02:23:23,304
How about that key?

1829
02:23:36,276 --> 02:23:40,238
- You want me to help you?
- No, please don't.

1830
02:24:33,166 --> 02:24:38,296
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
IN A DARK HOUSE

1831
02:26:18,354 --> 02:26:20,857
What fun this is!

1832
02:26:22,275 --> 02:26:26,195
I went out to the summer cottage yesterday
and turned on the heat,

1833
02:26:26,279 --> 02:26:30,825
and I cleaned and stocked up on food.

1834
02:26:30,908 --> 02:26:32,743
Just like old times.

1835
02:26:32,827 --> 02:26:34,704
When was I there last?

1836
02:26:35,663 --> 02:26:39,041
Seven years ago.

1837
02:26:40,293 --> 02:26:43,880
- What about you?
- I don't spend much time there.

1838
02:26:43,963 --> 02:26:45,965
Henrik's not fond of the seaside.

1839
02:26:46,549 --> 02:26:52,388
The girls and I go out there occasionally,

1840
02:26:52,472 --> 02:26:54,682
but they have their own lives nowadays.

1841
02:26:55,808 --> 02:26:57,393
How's your husband?

1842
02:26:58,436 --> 02:27:00,146
Overworked.

1843
02:27:00,229 --> 02:27:02,857
He suffers from high blood pressure.

1844
02:27:03,941 --> 02:27:05,610
How's your wife?

1845
02:27:05,693 --> 02:27:08,029
She's in Italy for a rest cure.

1846
02:27:08,613 --> 02:27:12,283
Isn't it amazing they're both abroad
at the same time?

1847
02:27:12,366 --> 02:27:15,328
It's practically indecent.

1848
02:27:16,287 --> 02:27:18,414
That's what's so nice.

1849
02:27:38,017 --> 02:27:40,019
The place hasn't changed much.

1850
02:27:40,853 --> 02:27:42,522
It's a bit dilapidated.

1851
02:27:42,605 --> 02:27:45,566
It needs fixing up, but we can't afford it.

1852
02:27:51,906 --> 02:27:58,329
Put the car away
or Erik will see it and come over.

1853
02:27:58,412 --> 02:28:01,874
- Imagine the gossip if he saw you.
- I will, dear.

1854
02:28:06,629 --> 02:28:08,839
Aren't you going to do it now?

1855
02:28:08,923 --> 02:28:10,550
I'll do it later.

1856
02:28:38,619 --> 02:28:40,621
This does feel kind of strange.

1857
02:28:45,042 --> 02:28:47,420
Why don't we lie down on the bed?

1858
02:28:49,130 --> 02:28:50,548
Come on.

1859
02:28:51,007 --> 02:28:52,883
This is silly...

1860
02:28:53,676 --> 02:28:56,512
but I'm as nervous
as if it were the first time.

1861
02:28:56,596 --> 02:28:59,515
But it's not. Come on.

1862
02:29:08,608 --> 02:29:11,152
It's been nearly a year now.

1863
02:29:11,986 --> 02:29:15,865
It was the day before my birthday.

1864
02:29:15,948 --> 02:29:18,784
And today's August 28.

1865
02:29:19,452 --> 02:29:21,078
You seduced me.

1866
02:29:21,162 --> 02:29:23,539
I did.

1867
02:29:23,623 --> 02:29:27,376
- Did you ever go see the last act?
- No.

1868
02:29:28,419 --> 02:29:32,214
We must have looked funny
sneaking out of the theater.

1869
02:29:32,298 --> 02:29:35,885
- What made you decide to do it?
- I don't know.

1870
02:29:37,136 --> 02:29:40,973
The second I entered the theater,
I saw you sitting there all alone.

1871
02:29:41,766 --> 02:29:46,687
You looked so lonely.
It seemed natural to pounce on you.

1872
02:29:46,771 --> 02:29:48,731
I was terribly pleased.

1873
02:29:49,398 --> 02:29:52,943
So was I.

1874
02:29:53,027 --> 02:29:55,571
You said, "Let's go."

1875
02:29:55,655 --> 02:29:57,281
And you blushed.

1876
02:29:57,365 --> 02:30:01,410
No wonder. I had such a hard-on.

1877
02:30:01,911 --> 02:30:04,163
You got me pretty hot too.

1878
02:30:04,246 --> 02:30:06,582
We hadn't seen each other
for two whole years.

1879
02:30:06,666 --> 02:30:09,001
That's right. Two years.

1880
02:30:09,085 --> 02:30:11,504
And now it's our first anniversary.

1881
02:30:13,005 --> 02:30:14,215
No.

1882
02:30:14,298 --> 02:30:16,050
What do you mean?

1883
02:30:16,509 --> 02:30:19,053
It's not our first anniversary.

1884
02:30:20,221 --> 02:30:22,807
It's our 20th.

1885
02:30:22,890 --> 02:30:25,101
We got married 20 years ago.

1886
02:30:26,060 --> 02:30:28,521
That's right. Twenty years.

1887
02:30:29,689 --> 02:30:31,524
An entire lifetime.

1888
02:30:32,775 --> 02:30:35,861
We've spent a whole grown-up life together.

1889
02:30:37,154 --> 02:30:39,031
Isn't that strange?

1890
02:30:43,703 --> 02:30:46,914
My darling... my sweetheart.

1891
02:30:48,374 --> 02:30:54,380
It feels strange to be
in this wretched old bed together.

1892
02:30:57,049 --> 02:31:01,429
Our hotel rooms were better.
More anonymous.

1893
02:31:02,805 --> 02:31:05,015
It was wrong of us to come here.

1894
02:31:05,099 --> 02:31:07,435
We should have gone to Denmark.

1895
02:31:07,518 --> 02:31:10,479
There wasn't time. This is fine.

1896
02:31:10,563 --> 02:31:12,398
It isn't fine at all.

1897
02:31:12,481 --> 02:31:17,319
I know. We'll call Fredrik.
He has a cottage nearby.

1898
02:31:17,403 --> 02:31:19,613
How will we get in?

1899
02:31:19,697 --> 02:31:22,575
- I expect a neighbor has a key.
- This'll never work.

1900
02:31:22,658 --> 02:31:24,827
There's no harm in trying.

1901
02:31:31,542 --> 02:31:34,712
Fredrik? Johan here.

1902
02:31:34,795 --> 02:31:36,672
How are you?

1903
02:31:37,173 --> 02:31:39,300
I've never been better.

1904
02:31:40,134 --> 02:31:45,264
Listen, this is a delicate matter.
Are you alone?

1905
02:31:45,973 --> 02:31:50,269
Could I possibly borrow your cottage
for the weekend?

1906
02:31:52,605 --> 02:31:54,857
Exactly, but it's not what you think.

1907
02:31:57,109 --> 02:32:00,237
Very pretty. Young?

1908
02:32:00,321 --> 02:32:02,281
Almost too young.

1909
02:32:03,949 --> 02:32:05,951
It's a sticky situation.

1910
02:32:06,952 --> 02:32:09,121
Thanks! That's great.

1911
02:32:09,997 --> 02:32:12,208
I owe you one.

1912
02:32:13,125 --> 02:32:15,711
Don't say a word to Birgit.

1913
02:32:16,295 --> 02:32:18,589
Women don't understand things like this.

1914
02:32:20,007 --> 02:32:21,383
Right then.

1915
02:32:22,259 --> 02:32:24,428
The key's under the stone step.
Fine.

1916
02:32:25,471 --> 02:32:26,972
Yes, blonde.

1917
02:32:28,307 --> 02:32:30,184
With a fabulous figure.

1918
02:32:32,728 --> 02:32:34,271
I'll call you.

1919
02:32:35,147 --> 02:32:37,233
I really appreciate this.

1920
02:32:38,442 --> 02:32:39,985
Thanks. Give my love to Birgit.

1921
02:32:40,069 --> 02:32:43,322
No, better scratch that.

1922
02:32:43,405 --> 02:32:44,406
Bye.

1923
02:32:46,784 --> 02:32:48,994
- Here it is.
- Nice place.

1924
02:32:53,833 --> 02:32:56,627
Here's the stone step.
It must be here.

1925
02:33:41,380 --> 02:33:44,383
- Let's clean up.
- Yes, let's.

1926
02:34:39,980 --> 02:34:41,398
What's wrong?

1927
02:34:42,191 --> 02:34:44,193
Are you crying?

1928
02:34:44,276 --> 02:34:47,571
You're so touching. I'm being silly.

1929
02:34:48,948 --> 02:34:50,950
Touching? Well, I'll be damned.

1930
02:34:51,700 --> 02:34:53,202
It's the truth.

1931
02:34:54,828 --> 02:34:56,747
My dear, beloved Johan.

1932
02:34:57,831 --> 02:35:01,085
- You've grown so small.
- You think I've shrunk too?

1933
02:35:01,168 --> 02:35:04,338
You're better this way.

1934
02:35:04,421 --> 02:35:06,715
Soft and gentle.

1935
02:35:07,466 --> 02:35:11,887
You used to look so tense and guarded.

1936
02:35:11,971 --> 02:35:13,347
You don't say.

1937
02:35:14,098 --> 02:35:16,016
Are people mean to you?

1938
02:35:16,558 --> 02:35:18,352
I don't know.

1939
02:35:19,478 --> 02:35:21,981
I've stopped being on the defensive.

1940
02:35:22,940 --> 02:35:28,654
Someone said I'd gone slack
and gave in too easily. It's not true.

1941
02:35:29,405 --> 02:35:33,242
But I've accepted my true dimensions

1942
02:35:33,325 --> 02:35:36,745
with a certain sense of humility.

1943
02:35:37,997 --> 02:35:40,708
It makes me kind... and a bit mournful.

1944
02:35:40,791 --> 02:35:43,419
You had such great expectations.

1945
02:35:43,502 --> 02:35:45,254
No, you're wrong.

1946
02:35:45,337 --> 02:35:48,215
Those were my family's expectations.

1947
02:35:49,591 --> 02:35:52,219
I really wanted to live up to them though.

1948
02:35:54,138 --> 02:35:56,765
You wanted to know
how things are with my husband?

1949
02:35:57,808 --> 02:36:00,185
Getting married was a big mistake.

1950
02:36:03,731 --> 02:36:05,649
We looked on it as a joke.

1951
02:36:06,984 --> 02:36:08,610
When did you meet?

1952
02:36:10,446 --> 02:36:12,197
A few years ago.

1953
02:36:17,119 --> 02:36:21,331
To be frank, it was a sexual affair.

1954
02:36:23,542 --> 02:36:24,752
I see.

1955
02:36:28,005 --> 02:36:31,425
Henrik is very...
How should I put this?

1956
02:36:32,593 --> 02:36:35,137
Convincing in that respect.

1957
02:36:35,721 --> 02:36:37,514
He truly enjoys sex.

1958
02:36:38,932 --> 02:36:43,437
And he made me realize
that I felt the same way.

1959
02:36:45,230 --> 02:36:48,484
I wasn't all that keen on it before.

1960
02:36:49,818 --> 02:36:51,236
So I remember.

1961
02:36:53,655 --> 02:36:56,992
- You don't like this subject, do you?
- No, I don't.

1962
02:36:59,119 --> 02:37:00,704
But it can't be helped.

1963
02:37:05,084 --> 02:37:10,089
I was obsessed by this new sensation.

1964
02:37:12,091 --> 02:37:13,759
I felt insatiable.

1965
02:37:15,177 --> 02:37:16,804
How nice.

1966
02:37:18,180 --> 02:37:19,681
For you, I mean.

1967
02:37:23,977 --> 02:37:27,356
I became very attached to Henrik,

1968
02:37:28,565 --> 02:37:30,484
and he was pretty fond of me.

1969
02:37:32,528 --> 02:37:37,074
But it wasn't long before
I caught him with other women.

1970
02:37:38,158 --> 02:37:39,952
What do you know.

1971
02:37:40,577 --> 02:37:43,622
I was hurt and humiliated.

1972
02:37:44,248 --> 02:37:46,166
Even jealous.

1973
02:37:47,793 --> 02:37:50,671
- Jealous? You?
- Can you imagine?

1974
02:37:51,630 --> 02:37:56,927
There was this violent scene,
and I told him to go to hell.

1975
02:37:57,594 --> 02:38:00,639
- Well, did he?
- Yes.

1976
02:38:02,015 --> 02:38:03,517
He did.

1977
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:06,562
He said I was too histrionic,
and then he left.

1978
02:38:09,356 --> 02:38:12,192
Later I begged him to come back.

1979
02:38:16,196 --> 02:38:20,284
Johan, you look so thoughtful.

1980
02:38:20,367 --> 02:38:23,912
I was just thinking
how everything's fine, that's all.

1981
02:38:25,164 --> 02:38:27,082
Fantastic.

1982
02:38:27,541 --> 02:38:29,459
Couldn't be better.

1983
02:38:30,127 --> 02:38:31,628
Only I can't take it!

1984
02:38:31,712 --> 02:38:33,505
I knew you didn't want to hear the truth.

1985
02:38:34,715 --> 02:38:38,719
Do you really think I care about
your orgasms with that workaholic?

1986
02:38:39,845 --> 02:38:43,515
I applaud your emancipation.
Most impressive.

1987
02:38:43,599 --> 02:38:45,893
You should write a novel.

1988
02:38:45,976 --> 02:38:49,521
The Women's Lib movement would rejoice.

1989
02:38:49,605 --> 02:38:52,441
I hope you're not as stupid as you sound.

1990
02:38:52,524 --> 02:38:54,610
I don't give a damn!

1991
02:38:55,194 --> 02:38:56,904
Suddenly it matters terribly.

1992
02:38:56,987 --> 02:38:59,114
No, not really.

1993
02:38:59,198 --> 02:39:03,869
It's just a taste of the marvelous things
life has to offer.

1994
02:39:05,829 --> 02:39:10,125
Think of the awareness we've gained.

1995
02:39:10,209 --> 02:39:12,586
It's magnificent. Almost fantastic.

1996
02:39:14,838 --> 02:39:17,299
We've discovered ourselves.
It's unbelievable.

1997
02:39:17,382 --> 02:39:20,594
One faces up to his insignificance,
the other, to her greatness.

1998
02:39:22,721 --> 02:39:26,892
Here we are, bad-mouthing our spouses.

1999
02:39:27,434 --> 02:39:30,145
They're almost right here
in this room with us.

2000
02:39:31,230 --> 02:39:33,607
It's mental group sex to the max!

2001
02:39:34,691 --> 02:39:38,070
It's like a textbook on life.

2002
02:39:38,153 --> 02:39:43,909
It's fabulously clever, but I can't stand it.

2003
02:39:45,077 --> 02:39:49,373
I know what you mean,
but I don't find it terrible.

2004
02:39:50,415 --> 02:39:54,503
I can't abide this cold light
directed on my every endeavor.

2005
02:39:54,586 --> 02:39:57,631
How I battle with futility.

2006
02:39:59,258 --> 02:40:03,553
I console myself with the thought
that life is what you make of it.

2007
02:40:04,763 --> 02:40:07,349
But it's of no comfort.

2008
02:40:08,934 --> 02:40:10,894
I want something to long for.

2009
02:40:10,978 --> 02:40:12,938
I don't feel the same way.

2010
02:40:16,400 --> 02:40:18,068
I realize that.

2011
02:40:26,576 --> 02:40:28,203
I persevere.

2012
02:40:29,955 --> 02:40:31,623
I enjoy myself.

2013
02:40:34,042 --> 02:40:36,253
I rely on common sense

2014
02:40:37,671 --> 02:40:39,381
and my gut feeling.

2015
02:40:40,757 --> 02:40:42,676
They work in tandem.

2016
02:40:43,969 --> 02:40:45,804
I'm content with my direction.

2017
02:40:47,639 --> 02:40:50,642
Time has given me a third partner:

2018
02:40:52,519 --> 02:40:54,771
experience.

2019
02:40:56,648 --> 02:40:58,525
You should be a politician.

2020
02:40:59,151 --> 02:41:01,486
- Maybe you're right.
- Good Lord.

2021
02:41:05,449 --> 02:41:07,200
I like people.

2022
02:41:09,161 --> 02:41:11,663
I enjoy negotiation,

2023
02:41:12,205 --> 02:41:15,959
prudence, compromise.

2024
02:41:16,043 --> 02:41:18,253
Rehearsing your campaign speech?

2025
02:41:19,755 --> 02:41:22,007
Am I so impossible?

2026
02:41:22,090 --> 02:41:23,925
Only when you preach.

2027
02:41:25,344 --> 02:41:27,429
I won't say another word.

2028
02:41:33,185 --> 02:41:36,229
Promise me:
no more intimate truths tonight.

2029
02:41:37,022 --> 02:41:38,690
I promise.

2030
02:41:39,441 --> 02:41:42,611
Promise me you won't mention
that orgasmic athlete again.

2031
02:41:42,694 --> 02:41:44,696
Not a word.

2032
02:41:46,114 --> 02:41:51,828
Promise to rein in
your awful levelheadedness.

2033
02:41:51,912 --> 02:41:54,956
That will be difficult, but I'll try.

2034
02:41:55,957 --> 02:41:57,959
Could you possibly...

2035
02:41:58,043 --> 02:41:59,878
I say possibly...

2036
02:42:00,504 --> 02:42:04,466
use your boundless
feminine powers sparingly?

2037
02:42:05,384 --> 02:42:07,719
I see that I'll have to.

2038
02:42:09,096 --> 02:42:10,472
All right, then.

2039
02:42:13,266 --> 02:42:15,143
Let's go to bed.

2040
02:42:59,771 --> 02:43:02,441
What is it? There, there.

2041
02:43:22,294 --> 02:43:25,213
Come, sit here beside me.

2042
02:43:26,631 --> 02:43:28,675
There, there.

2043
02:43:44,065 --> 02:43:47,068
What brings on nightmares?

2044
02:43:47,152 --> 02:43:49,404
What do you think causes them?

2045
02:43:49,488 --> 02:43:52,199
- Maybe it's something you ate.
- You think so?

2046
02:43:54,534 --> 02:44:00,415
Unless there's something in your
well-ordered world you can't get at.

2047
02:44:00,499 --> 02:44:04,336
Hold me.
I'm shivering, even though I'm hot.

2048
02:44:05,712 --> 02:44:09,257
I might be coming down with something.
The girls have been sick.

2049
02:44:09,341 --> 02:44:11,343
You'll feel better soon.

2050
02:44:12,469 --> 02:44:14,387
Pull the covers up.

2051
02:44:16,431 --> 02:44:20,060
- That's nice.
- What were you dreaming about?

2052
02:44:23,104 --> 02:44:27,192
We were crossing a dangerous road.

2053
02:44:28,860 --> 02:44:32,531
I wanted you and the girls to hold on to me.

2054
02:44:34,366 --> 02:44:38,203
But my hands were missing.

2055
02:44:38,286 --> 02:44:42,666
All I had left were stumps.

2056
02:44:43,708 --> 02:44:46,545
I'm sliding around in soft sand.

2057
02:44:47,462 --> 02:44:49,422
I can't get a hold of you.

2058
02:44:49,506 --> 02:44:53,093
You're all up there on the road,
and I can't reach you.

2059
02:44:53,176 --> 02:44:54,928
What a horrible dream.

2060
02:44:58,348 --> 02:45:00,642
- Johan?
- Yes, my dear.

2061
02:45:00,725 --> 02:45:04,145
- Are we living in utter confusion?
- You and I?

2062
02:45:04,229 --> 02:45:07,566
- No, all of us.
- What do you mean?

2063
02:45:09,359 --> 02:45:14,573
I'm talking about fear,
uncertainty and ignorance.

2064
02:45:16,366 --> 02:45:21,496
Do you think that secretly
we're afraid we're slipping downhill

2065
02:45:21,580 --> 02:45:24,207
and don't know what to do?

2066
02:45:24,291 --> 02:45:25,917
Yes, I think so.

2067
02:45:27,877 --> 02:45:30,422
Is it too late?

2068
02:45:30,922 --> 02:45:32,048
Yes.

2069
02:45:33,091 --> 02:45:35,927
But we shouldn't say things like that.
Only think them.

2070
02:45:41,641 --> 02:45:43,810
Have we missed something important?

2071
02:45:44,853 --> 02:45:47,230
- All of us?
- No, you and I.

2072
02:45:47,314 --> 02:45:48,898
What would that be?

2073
02:45:50,775 --> 02:45:55,113
At times I can read your mind,

2074
02:45:56,031 --> 02:46:00,535
and I feel such tenderness
that I forget myself.

2075
02:46:00,619 --> 02:46:02,829
Without having to efface myself.

2076
02:46:03,663 --> 02:46:07,959
It's a new sensation.
Do you understand?

2077
02:46:08,960 --> 02:46:10,587
I understand.

2078
02:46:28,772 --> 02:46:33,568
Sometimes it grieves me
that I've never loved anyone.

2079
02:46:36,488 --> 02:46:39,240
I don't think I've ever been loved either.

2080
02:46:42,118 --> 02:46:44,788
That distresses me.

2081
02:46:44,871 --> 02:46:47,374
Now you're being dramatic.

2082
02:46:48,583 --> 02:46:51,127
- Am I?
- I know what I feel.

2083
02:46:52,087 --> 02:46:56,341
I love you in my selfish way.

2084
02:46:57,801 --> 02:47:00,845
And I think you love me

2085
02:47:00,929 --> 02:47:03,682
in your fussy, pestering way.

2086
02:47:03,765 --> 02:47:09,187
We love each other
in an earthly and imperfect way.

2087
02:47:10,188 --> 02:47:12,357
But you're so demanding.

2088
02:47:13,191 --> 02:47:14,359
I am.

2089
02:47:15,944 --> 02:47:20,281
But here I am, in the middle of the night,
without much fanfare,

2090
02:47:20,365 --> 02:47:22,867
in a dark house somewhere in the world,

2091
02:47:23,993 --> 02:47:26,371
sitting with my arms around you.

2092
02:47:27,539 --> 02:47:30,208
And your arms are around me.

2093
02:47:31,793 --> 02:47:35,839
I'm not the most compassionate of men.

2094
02:47:35,922 --> 02:47:37,132
No, you're not.

2095
02:47:37,215 --> 02:47:39,300
I don't seem to have the imagination for it.

2096
02:47:39,384 --> 02:47:41,469
No, you're rather unimaginative.

2097
02:47:41,553 --> 02:47:45,807
I don't know what my love looks like,
and I can't describe it.

2098
02:47:46,683 --> 02:47:49,060
Most of the time I can't feel it.

2099
02:47:50,395 --> 02:47:53,898
And you really think I love you too?

2100
02:47:54,691 --> 02:47:56,359
Yes, I do.

2101
02:47:56,943 --> 02:48:00,405
But if we harp on it,
our love will evaporate.

2102
02:48:01,406 --> 02:48:04,576
Let's sit like this all night.

2103
02:48:05,160 --> 02:48:07,454
Oh, no, let's not.

2104
02:48:07,537 --> 02:48:08,788
No?

2105
02:48:08,872 --> 02:48:13,001
One leg's gone to sleep,
my left arm's practically dislocated,

2106
02:48:13,084 --> 02:48:16,254
I'm sleepy, and my back's cold.

2107
02:48:19,257 --> 02:48:21,676
Then let's snuggle down.

2108
02:48:21,760 --> 02:48:23,511
Yes, let's.

2109
02:48:40,653 --> 02:48:44,449
Good night, my darling.
It was good talking to you.

2110
02:48:45,784 --> 02:48:47,368
Sleep well.

2111
02:48:48,203 --> 02:48:49,746
Thanks. Same to you.
