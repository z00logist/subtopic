3
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:18,556
<i>And when the Lamb
had opened the seventh seal...</i>

4
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,730
<i>there was silence in heaven
about the space of half an hour.</i>

5
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:32,403
<i>And the seven angels
who had the seven trumpets...</i>

6
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,990
<i>prepared themselves to sound.</i>

7
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:32,190
Who are you?

8
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,193
I am Death.

9
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:37,528
Have you come for me?

10
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:40,281
I've long been at your side.

11
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:42,116
Yes, I know.

12
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:43,952
Are you ready?

13
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:47,997
My flesh is afraid, but I am not.

14
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,423
Wait a moment.

15
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,803
You all say that.
But I grant no reprieves.

16
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:04,097
You play chess, do you not?

17
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:06,933
How did you know?

18
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:09,644
I've seen paintings
and heard ballads.

19
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:14,232
Yes, I am quite a skillful player.

20
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,484
You can't be better than me.

21
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:18,778
Why play chess with me?

22
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:20,697
That's my business.

23
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:22,407
You're quite right.

24
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:27,328
But as long as I hold out against you,
I get to live.

25
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:30,123
And if I win, you set me free.

26
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,840
You drew black.

27
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:42,885
Very appropriate,
don't you think?

28
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:01,089
<i>Between a strumpet's legs to lie</i>

29
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:05,760
<i>That's the place for such as I</i>

30
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:16,854
<i>The Lord is up in heaven high
Far away off in the sky</i>

31
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:20,399
<i>While here below on every street</i>

32
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:23,111
<i>It's Brother Satan you will meet</i>

33
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:27,240
Everyone in Farjestad spoke
of evil omens and other horrors.

34
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:30,743
They say two horses devoured
each other last night.

35
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:32,620
Graves opened wide,

36
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:36,124
and corpses lay scattered about.

37
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,753
Four suns hung in the sky
yesterday afternoon.

38
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:02,984
Can you tell me
the way to the inn?

39
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:29,302
Did he tell you the way?

40
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:31,012
Not exactly.

41
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,973
What did he say?
Nothing.

42
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:36,976
Was he mute?
No, sire.

43
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:40,813
As a matter of fact,
he was quite eloquent.

44
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,816
I see.
Most eloquent.

45
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,570
Though what he had to say
was quite gloomy.

46
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:22,373
Good morning.
Have you had your breakfast?

47
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,127
Pity I can't eat grass.

48
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:28,129
Can you teach me how?

49
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:30,840
We're a little hard up right now.

50
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:34,635
Folks in these parts
don't care much for juggling.

51
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:30,900
Mia, wake up!

52
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,194
I have to tell you what I saw!

53
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:34,695
Did something happen?

54
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,614
I had a vision.

55
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:40,618
No, it wasn't a vision.
It was quite real.

56
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,080
I see.
You had another vision.

57
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,001
I really did see her.

58
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:53,339
Whom did you see?

59
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:55,383
The Virgin Mary.

60
00:11:57,635 --> 00:11:59,053
Did you really?

61
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,472
She was so close
I could have touched her.

62
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:05,393
She wore a golden crown
and a blue robe with golden flowers.

63
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,896
She was barefoot,
and in her little brown hands

64
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:12,525
she was holding the Child
and teaching him to walk.

65
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:16,821
She saw me watching her
and smiled at me.

66
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:19,532
My eyes filled with tears,

67
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:22,576
and when I wiped them away,
she was gone.

68
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:26,872
And there was
a great stillness everywhere,

69
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:30,126
in heaven and on earth.

70
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:32,545
You understand?

71
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,589
The things you imagine.

72
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:39,510
I see you don't believe me,
but it was real.

73
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,265
Not the reality you see.
A different kind.

74
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:48,436
Like when you said the devil
had painted our wagon wheels red,

75
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,604
using his tail for a brush.

76
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,107
Why must you always
bring that up?

77
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:56,026
Then we found
red paint under your nails.

78
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:58,279
Perhaps I did make that up,

79
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:02,741
but only so you'd believe
my other visions, the real ones.

80
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:04,785
Keep your visions in check...

81
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:08,247
or people will think
you're a half-wit, which you're not.

82
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:12,960
At least not yet, as far as I know.
Though I can't be sure.

83
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:15,087
I didn't ask to have visions.

84
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,465
It's not my fault
if voices speak to me,

85
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,633
the Virgin appears to me,

86
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,428
and angels and devils
like my company.

87
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:26,182
I told you once and for all:

88
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,476
I must have
my sleep in the morning!

89
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:32,396
I've begged and pleaded,
but nothing helps.

90
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,565
So now I'm telling you:

91
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,192
Shut up!

92
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,915
Mikael.

93
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,719
I want a better life for Mikael.

94
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,055
He's going to be a great acrobat.

95
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,724
Or perhaps a juggler

96
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,435
who can do
the one impossible trick.

97
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,187
What trick is that?

98
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:15,940
Making a ball
hang suspended in midair.

99
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:19,235
That's impossible.
For you and me.

100
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,111
But not for him.

101
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,532
You and your dreams.

102
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,953
I wrote a song

103
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:32,665
while I lay awake all last night.

104
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,751
Want to hear it?
Yes, sing it.

105
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,878
I'm very curious.

106
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,757
<i>On a lily branch
a dove is perched</i>

107
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:45,177
<i>Against the Midsummer sky</i>

108
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:49,431
<i>He sings so sweetly
of Jesus Christ</i>

109
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:54,228
<i>And there's
great rejoicing on high</i>

110
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:59,108
Mia, are you asleep?

111
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,735
It was a lovely song.

112
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,362
I'm not done yet.

113
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:06,448
I heard,
but I'll just sleep a bit more.

114
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:08,576
Sing me the rest later.

115
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:10,911
All you do is sleep.

116
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:16,667
Is this any mask for an actor?
I ask you.

117
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:20,671
If the priests didn't pay so well,
I'd turn them down.

118
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:22,506
Going to play Death?

119
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:26,343
Scaring decent folk out of their wits
with this nonsense!

120
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,470
Where are we performing?

121
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:33,726
The saints' feast in Elsinore 
on the church steps, no less.

122
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:38,772
Why not something bawdy?
People prefer it, and it's more fun.

123
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,357
Idiot!

124
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,652
They say an evil pestilence
stalks the land.

125
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:48,157
The priests are speculating
in sudden death and moral bellyache.

126
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,783
What parts are we playing?

127
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,578
A fool like you can play
the soul of man.

128
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,413
Now that's a bad part.

129
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:58,375
Who decides here?
Who directs this troupe? I ask you.

130
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:02,713
"To this law, O fool,
there's no retort.

131
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,799
Your life hangs by a thread...

132
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,969
and your time is short."

133
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:15,809
Will the ladies fancy me
in this getup? I ask you.

134
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,824
Jof?
What is it?

135
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,577
Sit still and don't say a word.

136
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,746
I'm as silent as the grave.

137
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:38,165
I love you.

138
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,779
What's that supposed to be?

139
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,531
The dance of Death.

140
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:14,034
That's Death there?
Yes, he's dancing off with them.

141
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,036
Why paint such nonsense?

142
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,039
To remind people
they're going to die.

143
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:21,375
That won't cheer them up any.

144
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:24,378
Why always cheer them up,
damn it?

145
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,672
Why not scare them a bit?

146
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:30,634
They won't look at your paintings.
Oh, yes, they will.

147
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:34,263
A skull is more interesting
than a naked woman.

148
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,265
If you scare them 

149
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:38,267
They'll think.
And if they think 

150
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:41,937
They'll get scared.
And run into the arms of the priests.

151
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,940
I can't help that.
You just paint your pictures.

152
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:48,444
I paint things as they are.
People can do as they like.

153
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,571
Some will curse you.

154
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:54,158
Well, then I'll paint
something amusing.

155
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,493
A man's got to live.

156
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,246
At least till the plague gets him.

157
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,999
The plague? Sounds horrible.

158
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,754
You should see
the boils on the neck...

159
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,257
and how the body shrivels up

160
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:13,761
and the limbs flail around
like crazed ropes.

161
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:19,975
Sounds nasty.
Nasty indeed.

162
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:24,229
They try to tear the boils
right out of their flesh.

163
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,607
They bite their own hands,

164
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:29,485
scratch open their own veins,

165
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:32,613
and scream to high heaven.

166
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:35,115
Frightened?

167
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:38,285
Me? You don't know me.

168
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:41,038
What's that rubbish there?

169
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:44,833
Remarkably,
the poor wretches think

170
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:48,545
that the plague
is a punishment from God.

171
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:53,675
Crowds of "sinners" wander the land
whipping themselves and others

172
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,552
to please the Lord.

173
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,471
They whip themselves?

174
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,516
Yes. It's a horrible sight.

175
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:04,144
Best to hide in a ditch
until they pass.

176
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:09,566
Got any gin?
I've had nothing but water all day.

177
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,986
I'm as thirsty as a desert camel.

178
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,322
I think I frightened you after all.

179
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:47,729
I want to confess
as honestly as I can,

180
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,107
but my heart is empty.

181
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,360
And the emptiness is a mirror

182
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,737
turned toward my own face.

183
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,074
I see myself in it,

184
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:02,286
and it fills me
with loathing and horror.

185
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:13,255
My indifference to my fellow men
has cut me off from their company.

186
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,968
I live now in a world of phantoms,

187
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:20,596
a prisoner of my own dreams.

188
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:24,516
Yet you don't want to die.
Yes, I do.

189
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,561
What are you waiting for?

190
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,313
I want to know.

191
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,232
You want a guarantee.

192
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,484
Call it what you will.

193
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:44,286
Must it be so cruelly inconceivable
to know God through one's senses?

194
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:49,124
Why must he hide in a fog
of half-spoken promises

195
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,251
and unseen miracles?

196
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,755
How can we believe the believers
when we don't believe ourselves?

197
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:59,760
What will become of us
who want to believe but cannot?

198
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:03,263
And what of those
who neither will nor can believe?

199
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:06,433
Why can I not kill off
this God within me?

200
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,479
Why must he live on inside me
in this painful, humiliating way

201
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:14,107
when I want to tear him
out of my heart?

202
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:17,778
Why does he remain
a mocking reality

203
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:20,238
that I can't shake off?

204
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:23,116
You hear me?
I hear you.

205
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,745
I want knowledge.

206
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,873
Not faith or conjecture,
but knowledge.

207
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,669
I want God to reach out his hand,

208
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:36,672
show his face, speak to me.

209
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:38,799
But he is silent.

210
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,177
I cry out to him in the darkness,

211
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:45,347
but sometimes it feels
like no one is there.

212
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,641
Perhaps no one <i>is</i> there.

213
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:50,185
Then life is just senseless horror.

214
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,063
No man can live facing death

215
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,691
knowing that everything
is nothingness.

216
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:58,902
Most people give no thought
to death or nothingness.

217
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:02,656
One day they'll stand on the far edge
of life, peering into the darkness.

218
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,158
Ah, that day.

219
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,412
I understand what you mean.

220
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:12,332
We carve an idol out of our fear

221
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,502
and call it God.

222
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,338
You're upset.

223
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,508
Death visited me this morning.

224
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,344
We're playing chess together.

225
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,516
This reprieve will enable me
to attend to an urgent matter.

226
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:31,268
What sort of matter?

227
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:36,773
My whole life has been nothing
but futile wandering and pursuits,

228
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:39,484
a great deal of talk
without meaning.

229
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,362
It's all been in vain.

230
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:46,241
I say that without bitterness
or self-reproach,

231
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:50,579
knowing that
most men's lives are the same.

232
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:57,711
But I want to use my reprieve
for one meaningful act.

233
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,716
So that's why you're playing
chess with Death.

234
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,386
He's a skillful strategist,

235
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:10,057
but I haven't lost a single piece yet.

236
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:14,061
How will you outwit him?

237
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:18,231
Through a combination
of bishop and knight...

238
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:21,359
that he has yet to catch on to.

239
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,403
Next I'll charge his flank.

240
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:27,908
I'll remember that.

241
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:35,707
You tricked me...

242
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,710
and cheated me.

243
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,047
But we will meet again...

244
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,883
and I'll find a way out.

245
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,552
We'll meet at the inn...

246
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,222
and continue our game there.

247
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,355
This is my hand.

248
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,358
I can move it.

249
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,986
Blood pulses through its veins.

250
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:09,491
The sun still stands
high in the sky,

251
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:11,493
and I...

252
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,663
Antonius Block...

253
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:19,292
am playing chess with Death.

254
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:25,632
My master and I
just returned from abroad.

255
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:29,177
Understand, my painter friend?

256
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,847
The crusades?

257
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,515
Precisely.

258
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:36,309
We spent ten years
in the Holy Land

259
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,895
letting snakes bite us,
insects sting us,

260
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,398
wild beasts maul us,
heathens attack us,

261
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:44,276
bad wine poison us,
women infect us,

262
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:46,862
lice eat us,
and fever consume us 

263
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:50,240
all for the glory of God.

264
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:52,242
For the glory of God.

265
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:57,038
Our crusade was so stupid

266
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:00,750
that only a true idealist
could have thought it up.

267
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:08,425
What you said
about the plague was horrible.

268
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,510
It's worse than that.

269
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:16,474
Well, wherever you turn,
your rump's always behind you.

270
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,310
There's a great truth.

271
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:22,731
Your rump's always behind you.

272
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:25,442
A profound truth.

273
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:28,111
Here you see squire Jons.

274
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,947
He grins at Death,
scoffs at the Lord,

275
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:33,533
laughs at himself,
and smiles at the girls.

276
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,913
He lives in a Jons-world
believable only to himself,

277
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,749
ridiculous to all,
including himself,

278
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:45,378
meaningless to heaven,
and of no interest to hell.

279
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:14,491
Your soup stinks like hell.
What's it for?

280
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:18,245
She had carnal intercourse
with the Evil One.

281
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:20,914
And now she's in the stocks.

282
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:25,961
She's to be burned tomorrow,
and we must ward off the devil.

283
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:28,088
With that stinking muck?

284
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,423
It's the best remedy:

285
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:34,010
blood mixed with the bile
of a big black dog.

286
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:37,555
The Evil One can't stand the smell.

287
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:39,849
Neither can I.

288
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,610
Have you seen the devil?

289
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,282
You mustn't speak to her.
Is it that dangerous?

290
00:26:55,699 --> 00:27:00,620
I don't know, but she's thought
to be the cause of this plague.

291
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:34,612
<i>Fate's a roguish villain</i>

292
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,741
<i>Poor friend, you're at his call</i>

293
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,702
<i>First you leap and bound</i>

294
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,872
<i>Then like a worm you crawl</i>

295
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,083
Must you sing?

296
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,710
No.

297
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:57,547
Why look so surprised?
I steal from the dead.

298
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:00,216
A lucrative business nowadays.

299
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:07,307
No use running off
to tell the others.

300
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:11,311
Every man saves his own skin.

301
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:13,313
It's as simple as that.

302
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,316
Don't try to scream.

303
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:19,319
There's no one to hear you,
neither God nor man.

304
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,488
Nothing to be surprised about.

305
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:30,997
I know you,
but it's been a long time.

306
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:34,501
You're Raval,
from the seminary in Roskilde.

307
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:38,338
<i>Doctor mirabilis,
coelestis et diabilis.</i>

308
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,840
Am I not right?

309
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,762
Ten years ago
you convinced my master

310
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,932
to join a noble crusade
to the Holy Land.

311
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:54,729
You look uneasy.
Stomach bothering you?

312
00:30:56,689 --> 00:31:01,361
I suddenly understand the meaning
of those ten wasted years.

313
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:04,697
We were too well-off,
too satisfied with ourselves.

314
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:07,283
The Lord sought
to chasten our smug pride.

315
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:10,703
So he sent you

316
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:14,207
to spew your holy venom
and poison my master's mind.

317
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:15,875
I acted in good faith.

318
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:19,796
Now you know better, huh?
You've turned thief.

319
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:25,051
A more suitable and rewarding
occupation for scoundrels.

320
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:27,095
Isn't that so?

321
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:34,269
Oh, I'm not a bloodthirsty man.

322
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,646
But next time we meet,

323
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:41,067
I'll mark up your face like they do
with petty scoundrels of your kind.

324
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:45,071
I just stopped in
to fill my waterskin.

325
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:55,540
Jons is the name.

326
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,251
A pleasant, talkative young man

327
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:03,590
who thinks only kind thoughts
and performs only noble deeds.

328
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,431
Farewell, my lass.

329
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:13,975
I could have raped you,

330
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:16,603
but I've tired of that kind of love.

331
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:19,188
It gets a little dry in the end.

332
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:26,321
Come to think of it,
I'll need a housekeeper.

333
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:28,323
Are you a good cook?

334
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:33,578
I'm a married man, but with any luck
my wife is dead by now,

335
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:36,122
so I'll be needing a housekeeper.

336
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:41,210
Don't stand there gaping,
damn it!

337
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:44,631
I saved your life!
You owe me a great deal!

338
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:02,732
Damn jugglers!

339
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:06,819
They're making fools
of themselves.

340
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:27,984
Stop that,
you tin-headed swine!

341
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,822
I'm not in the first part,
so I'm going behind the curtain.

342
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:36,826
Don't stand there gaping,
you blockheads!

343
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:41,748
<i>The horse sits in the tree
and crows</i>

344
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:48,588
<i>Wide is the path
but narrow is the gate</i>

345
00:34:48,713 --> 00:34:52,258
<i>The Black One
dances on the shore</i>

346
00:34:55,344 --> 00:35:00,475
<i>The hen mews in a lake so dark</i>

347
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,401
<i>The day is red
but the fish is dead</i>

348
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:14,322
<i>The Black One
crouches on the shore</i>

349
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:21,621
<i>The serpent flutters
high in the sky</i>

350
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:28,211
<i>The Virgin is pale
but the mouse is content</i>

351
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:31,839
<i>The Black One
runs on the shore</i>

352
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:37,470
<i>The ram hisses</i>

353
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,140
<i>Through his two teeth</i>

354
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:47,980
<i>The gust is strong</i>

355
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,818
<i>And the waves crash</i>

356
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:56,656
<i>The Black One
makes dung on the shore</i>

357
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,886
<i>The sow lays eggs
and the cat sows</i>

358
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:06,350
<i>The night is like soot
and the dark remains</i>

359
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:10,897
<i>The Black One stays and stays</i>

360
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:14,567
<i>And stays on the shore</i>

361
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:37,293
God has sent his punishment
down upon us.

362
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:45,718
You shall all perish
from the Black Death.

363
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:51,891
You there, gaping like cattle,

364
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:56,228
and you sitting there
in your glutted complacency,

365
00:39:56,395 --> 00:40:00,566
don't you know that this
could be your final hour?

366
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:06,906
Death stands at your back.

367
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:11,452
I see the crown of his head
gleaming in the sun.

368
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:15,998
His scythe flashes
above your heads.

369
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:19,335
Which of you
will he strike down first?

370
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,799
You there, staring like a goat 

371
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:27,968
will nightfall see your mouth

372
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,514
twisted into
its last unfinished gasp?

373
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:33,557
You, woman...

374
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:38,395
blooming with lust
for life and pleasure 

375
00:40:39,897 --> 00:40:44,443
will you grow pale
and wither before the dawn?

376
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:47,947
You there...

377
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:52,451
with your bulbous nose
and idiotic grin 

378
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:57,915
do you have another year
to defile the earth with your refuse?

379
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:03,671
Don't you obstinate fools know
you're going to die?

380
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:07,967
Today, tomorrow, the next day 
you're all doomed.

381
00:41:08,342 --> 00:41:11,137
You hear me?

382
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:13,222
Doomed!

383
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:19,687
Lord, have mercy on us
in our humiliation.

384
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:22,439
Turn thy face not away
in loathing and contempt,

385
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:24,984
but be merciful to us

386
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:28,154
for the sake of thy son,
Jesus Christ!

387
00:42:31,842 --> 00:42:34,303
All that damned ranting
about doom.

388
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:37,056
Is that sustenance
for modern people?

389
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:40,059
Do they really expect us
to take it seriously?

390
00:42:40,226 --> 00:42:42,353
You laugh at me, sire.

391
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:45,773
But I've read or heard
or lived through

392
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:48,609
all the tales men tell each other.

393
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:53,530
Even the ghost stories
about God the Father,

394
00:42:53,656 --> 00:42:55,824
Jesus Christ,
and the Holy Ghost 

395
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,410
I took them all in
without batting an eye.

396
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,538
What are you shouting about?

397
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:04,625
I'm Plog, the smith,
and you're Jons, the squire.

398
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,730
That may be.
Have you seen my wife?

399
00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:10,464
No, but if she looks like you,

400
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:13,717
I'd do my best to forget I had.

401
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,389
Then you haven't seen her?

402
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:21,267
Maybe she's run off.
You know something?

403
00:43:21,392 --> 00:43:24,103
Quite a lot.
But not about your wife.

404
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:27,022
Maybe they can help you
in the tavern.

405
00:43:47,293 --> 00:43:50,796
It's true. The plague
is spreading along the west coast.

406
00:43:50,963 --> 00:43:53,048
People are dying like flies.

407
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:55,843
Business should be good
this time of year,

408
00:43:55,968 --> 00:43:58,637
but I haven't sold a damn thing!

409
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:01,807
They speak of Judgment Day,

410
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:05,477
and there's all the evil omens.

411
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:10,190
They say a woman gave birth
to a calf's head.

412
00:44:10,316 --> 00:44:14,320
People are crazed.
They flee and take the plague with them.

413
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:17,948
If all that's true,
then we should enjoy life

414
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:20,492
as long as we're still standing.

415
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:24,371
Many have died
trying to purge themselves in fire,

416
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:30,169
but better to die pure
than live for hell, the priests say.

417
00:44:30,336 --> 00:44:31,795
This is the end 

418
00:44:32,004 --> 00:44:33,797
that's what it is.

419
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:38,177
No one dares say it aloud,
but this is the end.

420
00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:40,512
People are crazed with fear.

421
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:44,350
You're scared yourself.
I'm scared as hell!

422
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:48,854
Judgment Day
becomes Judgment Night,

423
00:44:49,021 --> 00:44:52,775
when the angels descend
and graves open.

424
00:44:53,025 --> 00:44:55,527
It will be a terrible sight.

425
00:44:59,615 --> 00:45:02,326
Want this bracelet?
You can have it cheap.

426
00:45:02,451 --> 00:45:05,037
I can't afford it.
It's genuine silver.

427
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:07,831
It's nice,
but I'm sure it's too expensive.

428
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:11,335
Excuse me,
but have any of you seen my wife?

429
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,046
Is she missing?
They say she's run off.

430
00:45:14,171 --> 00:45:16,507
Run off?
With an actor.

431
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:20,219
An actor?
If her taste is that bad, let her go.

432
00:45:20,344 --> 00:45:22,012
You're right.

433
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:25,307
My first thought, of course,
was to murder her.

434
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:28,143
Murder?
That's a different story.

435
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:30,646
And the actor with her.

436
00:45:30,938 --> 00:45:32,439
The actor?

437
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:35,901
Yes, the one she ran off with.
Whatever for?

438
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:38,695
Are you dense, or what?

439
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:41,949
Oh, the actor!
Now I understand.

440
00:45:42,074 --> 00:45:44,326
Yes, there are
far too many of them.

441
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:48,414
Guilty or not, you should kill him
just for being an actor.

442
00:45:48,956 --> 00:45:52,251
Listen, you.
You're lying to the smith.

443
00:45:52,543 --> 00:45:54,586
Me? Lying?

444
00:45:59,258 --> 00:46:01,176
You're an actor too.

445
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:04,346
A friend of yours probably
ran off with his old lady.

446
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:07,724
Are you an actor too?

447
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:11,437
Me, an actor?
I'd hardly call myself that.

448
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:14,731
We should kill you too.
It's only logical.

449
00:46:16,108 --> 00:46:17,985
You're very funny.

450
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:21,280
You've turned pale.
Guilty conscience?

451
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:22,906
You're funny.

452
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:26,201
Don't you think he's funny?
I see you don't.

453
00:46:27,536 --> 00:46:30,038
Perhaps we should
mark up your face

454
00:46:30,164 --> 00:46:33,208
like they do
with petty scoundrels of your kind.

455
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:35,961
What have you done
with my wife?

456
00:46:50,476 --> 00:46:53,604
You mean to hurt me? Why?

457
00:46:54,146 --> 00:46:57,149
Have I offended anyone
or got in the way?

458
00:46:57,274 --> 00:47:00,652
I'll leave right now
and never come back.

459
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:03,489
Stand up
so everyone can hear you.

460
00:47:07,451 --> 00:47:09,077
Speak louder.

461
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:14,708
Show us your acting skills:
Stand on your head.

462
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:28,514
What have you done
with my wife?

463
00:47:31,183 --> 00:47:33,185
Get up and dance!

464
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,103
No, I can't.

465
00:47:35,229 --> 00:47:38,023
Imitate a bear.
I can't imitate a bear.

466
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:39,775
We'll see about that.

467
00:48:39,418 --> 00:48:41,420
Get up! Be a good bear.

468
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:44,381
I can't be a bear anymore.

469
00:49:01,857 --> 00:49:05,277
Remember what I said I'd do
if we met again?

470
00:49:07,404 --> 00:49:09,031
I always keep my word!

471
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:35,223
What's his name?

472
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:37,100
Mikael.

473
00:49:37,601 --> 00:49:40,937
How old is he?
Over a year now.

474
00:49:42,064 --> 00:49:44,733
He's big for his age.
You think so?

475
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:47,444
Yes, I guess he is.

476
00:49:47,778 --> 00:49:50,989
You were
in that performance earlier.

477
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:52,699
Was it awful?

478
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:55,410
You're prettier
without that paint on your face,

479
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:57,579
and this dress suits you better.

480
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:59,373
You think so?

481
00:49:59,498 --> 00:50:03,835
Jonas Skat ran off and left us,
so we're in a real fix now.

482
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:06,254
Is that your husband?
Jonas?

483
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:10,467
No. The other one's my husband.
His name is Jof.

484
00:50:10,592 --> 00:50:12,260
Oh, him.

485
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:14,680
Now it's just the two of us.

486
00:50:14,846 --> 00:50:18,016
We'll have to do
those confounded tricks again.

487
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:20,185
You do tricks too?
Oh, yes.

488
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:22,854
And Jof is a good juggler.

489
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:25,190
Will Mikael be an acrobat too?

490
00:50:25,399 --> 00:50:28,235
Jof wants him to be.
But you don't?

491
00:50:28,527 --> 00:50:31,738
I don't know.
Perhaps he'll become a knight.

492
00:50:31,863 --> 00:50:34,282
That's not much fun either.

493
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:37,202
No, you don't look happy.
No.

494
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,871
Are you weary?

495
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:41,581
Why?

496
00:50:41,707 --> 00:50:43,333
I'm in dull company.

497
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:46,545
You mean your squire?
No, not him.

498
00:50:46,712 --> 00:50:48,380
Who then?

499
00:50:48,505 --> 00:50:50,173
Myself.

500
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,551
I understand.

501
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:54,720
Do you really?

502
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:57,472
Yes, I understand quite well.

503
00:50:57,889 --> 00:51:03,061
I've often wondered
why people torment themselves so.

504
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:04,396
Mia.

505
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:08,525
Jof! What is it?

506
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:13,363
Jof, where have you been?

507
00:51:14,406 --> 00:51:17,993
Come sit down.
Where have you been?

508
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,078
Let me see.

509
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:29,504
Why'd you go to that tavern?
You drank there, of course.

510
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:33,300
I didn't drink a drop!

511
00:51:33,967 --> 00:51:37,095
I suppose you sat boasting
about your angels and devils.

512
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,806
People don't look kindly
on those kinds of tales.

513
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:42,100
I never said
a damned word about angels!

514
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:44,853
Then you were singing
and dancing again.

515
00:51:44,978 --> 00:51:49,107
You're always performing.
People don't like that either.

516
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:53,403
Look what I bought for you.

517
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,327
You couldn't afford this.

518
00:52:00,452 --> 00:52:02,454
I bought it anyway.

519
00:52:05,874 --> 00:52:09,085
Oh, how they beat me!

520
00:52:09,711 --> 00:52:11,588
Why didn't you hit them back?

521
00:52:11,713 --> 00:52:13,882
I just get frightened and angry.

522
00:52:14,007 --> 00:52:16,301
I never get a chance
to hit back.

523
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:18,428
But boy, did I get angry!

524
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:20,806
I roared like a lion.

525
00:52:21,056 --> 00:52:22,516
Were they scared?

526
00:52:22,766 --> 00:52:24,893
No, they just laughed.

527
00:52:40,826 --> 00:52:42,619
Doesn't he smell nice?

528
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:45,497
He's so solid.
You're a sturdy one.

529
00:52:45,622 --> 00:52:47,624
A real little acrobat.

530
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,670
This is my husband, Jof.

531
00:52:54,339 --> 00:52:56,216
Good evening.

532
00:52:57,008 --> 00:53:00,512
You have a fine son there.
He'll bring you much joy.

533
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:02,514
Yes, he's a fine boy.

534
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,685
Have we nothing to offer our guest?
Nothing for me, thank you.

535
00:53:06,852 --> 00:53:09,396
I picked wild strawberries
this afternoon.

536
00:53:09,521 --> 00:53:14,317
And there's milk fresh from the cow.
That we had permission to take.

537
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:17,571
We'd be honored
if you'd share our humble meal.

538
00:53:17,696 --> 00:53:20,323
Sit down and I'll bring it.

539
00:53:21,074 --> 00:53:22,742
Please.

540
00:53:23,118 --> 00:53:26,371
Where are you headed now?
The saints' feast in Elsinore.

541
00:53:26,538 --> 00:53:28,540
I'd advise against that.

542
00:53:28,707 --> 00:53:30,375
Why, if I may ask?

543
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:33,253
The plague has spread
along the southern coast.

544
00:53:33,378 --> 00:53:35,630
Tens of thousands are dying.

545
00:53:35,755 --> 00:53:38,884
Ah, there's no end
to trouble in life, is there?

546
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:43,263
Come with me through the forest.
You can stay at my castle

547
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:46,057
or follow the eastern coast.
It'll be safer.

548
00:53:46,725 --> 00:53:49,853
These strawberries were growing
up on the hillside.

549
00:53:49,978 --> 00:53:52,105
I've never seen any so big.

550
00:53:52,856 --> 00:53:54,399
Just smell!

551
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:58,069
I wish you a hearty appetite.

552
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:00,155
My humble thanks.

553
00:54:00,906 --> 00:54:04,701
Your offer is attractive,
but I must think about it.

554
00:54:04,826 --> 00:54:08,121
It would be nice to have
company through the forest.

555
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:12,125
I've heard it's full of trolls
and ghosts and bandits.

556
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:16,004
It's not a bad idea,
but I must think it over.

557
00:54:16,129 --> 00:54:19,049
With Skat gone,
I'm in charge now.

558
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:22,886
I'm director
of the entire company now.

559
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:26,806
"I'm director
of the entire company now."

560
00:54:30,936 --> 00:54:32,646
Some strawberries?

561
00:54:32,771 --> 00:54:34,981
That man saved my life.

562
00:54:35,106 --> 00:54:37,108
Come join us, my friend.

563
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:39,444
Jons the squire
offers his thanks.

564
00:54:42,072 --> 00:54:44,074
Oh, how lovely this is.

565
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:46,701
For a little while.
Almost always.

566
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:49,955
One day is like another.

567
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:52,248
Nothing strange about that.

568
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:56,962
Summer is better than winter,
of course, because you aren't freezing.

569
00:54:57,504 --> 00:54:59,506
But spring is best of all.

570
00:54:59,631 --> 00:55:03,093
I wrote a song about spring.
I'll get my lyre 

571
00:55:03,218 --> 00:55:04,803
Not now, Jof.

572
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:07,639
Our guests may not care
for your songs.

573
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:10,809
By all means. I write songs myself.
You see?

574
00:55:10,976 --> 00:55:15,063
I have one about a randy fish
I bet you've never heard.

575
00:55:15,855 --> 00:55:18,191
And I guess you're not going to.

576
00:55:18,525 --> 00:55:21,653
Some don't appreciate my art,
and I wouldn't impose,

577
00:55:21,778 --> 00:55:23,488
sensitive soul that I am.

578
00:55:27,784 --> 00:55:29,869
People have
such troubles these days.

579
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:33,790
It's always better being a couple.
Do you have no one?

580
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:36,251
I had once.
Where is she now?

581
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:38,169
I don't know.

582
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:42,132
You look so solemn!
Was she your beloved?

583
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,426
We were newly married.

584
00:55:44,551 --> 00:55:47,303
We played and laughed endlessly.

585
00:55:47,804 --> 00:55:51,099
I wrote songs
to her eyes, her nose,

586
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:53,643
her beautiful little ears.

587
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:56,396
We hunted together.

588
00:55:56,521 --> 00:55:59,816
At night we danced,
and the house was full of life.

589
00:55:59,941 --> 00:56:02,193
How about some strawberries?

590
00:56:03,737 --> 00:56:06,448
Faith is a heavy burden,
you know?

591
00:56:06,865 --> 00:56:09,743
It's like loving someone
out in the darkness

592
00:56:09,868 --> 00:56:12,912
who never comes,
no matter how loud you call.

593
00:56:15,206 --> 00:56:17,876
How unreal all that seems now

594
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:20,545
sitting here with you
and your husband.

595
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:24,049
How insignificant all of a sudden.

596
00:56:25,341 --> 00:56:27,302
Now you don't look so solemn.

597
00:56:29,429 --> 00:56:31,556
I will remember this moment.

598
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:33,975
The stillness, the dusk...

599
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:38,521
these wild strawberries,
this bowl of milk...

600
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,068
your faces in the evening light.

601
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:45,653
Mikael asleep...

602
00:56:45,904 --> 00:56:48,156
Jof with his lyre.

603
00:56:49,115 --> 00:56:51,910
I'll try to remember
what we spoke of...

604
00:56:53,078 --> 00:56:56,581
and I'll hold that memory
in my hands

605
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:01,711
like a bowl full to the brim
with fresh milk.

606
00:57:07,759 --> 00:57:10,261
And it will be a sign for me...

607
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:14,015
and a source
of great satisfaction.

608
00:57:48,174 --> 00:57:49,634
I've been waiting.

609
00:57:51,928 --> 00:57:55,014
Forgive me. I was detained.

610
00:57:55,306 --> 00:57:58,810
Since I gave away my strategy,
I beat a retreat.

611
00:57:59,227 --> 00:58:02,730
Please. It's your turn.

612
00:58:02,981 --> 00:58:06,442
What are you so happy about?
That's my secret.

613
00:58:06,818 --> 00:58:08,319
Of course.

614
00:58:09,612 --> 00:58:13,324
I take your knight.
As you were meant to.

615
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:17,453
Did you trick me?
Of course!

616
00:58:17,871 --> 00:58:21,708
You fell right into my trap.
Check.

617
00:58:23,001 --> 00:58:24,794
Why do you laugh?

618
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:27,839
Never mind my laughter.
Just save your king.

619
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:30,383
You're very sure of yourself.

620
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:32,594
Our game amuses me.

621
00:58:34,012 --> 00:58:37,223
Your move.
And be quick. I'm in a hurry.

622
00:58:37,348 --> 00:58:39,684
I know you have much to do,

623
00:58:41,144 --> 00:58:43,354
but our game must proceed
at its own pace.

624
00:58:43,605 --> 00:58:46,733
Will you be escorting
those jesters through the forest?

625
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:51,529
The ones called Jof and Mia,
who have a little son?

626
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,868
Why do you ask?

627
00:58:58,953 --> 00:59:00,538
No reason.

628
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:12,217
Have you seen Jons?
We must be going.

629
00:59:12,383 --> 00:59:15,011
I think he's in the tavern.

630
00:59:18,723 --> 00:59:22,101
God in heaven!
If it isn't Plog the smith!

631
00:59:24,145 --> 00:59:26,439
Are you blubbering here
all by yourself?

632
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:28,441
Look at the smith,

633
00:59:28,566 --> 00:59:31,444
moaning like a rabbit
drowning in piss.

634
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:34,572
Your wife again?
Yes, I have yet to find her.

635
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:37,659
It's hell with women
and hell without them.

636
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:41,412
Best to kill 'em
while you're still having fun.

637
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:44,123
Nagging and pig swill.

638
00:59:44,249 --> 00:59:46,084
Screaming babies
and stinking diapers.

639
00:59:46,209 --> 00:59:48,378
Sharp nails and sharp words.

640
00:59:48,503 --> 00:59:51,297
The devil's own aunt
for a mother-in-law.

641
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:53,925
And when you climb into bed
to get some sleep 

642
00:59:54,092 --> 00:59:55,802
Then it's a different tune.

643
00:59:55,927 --> 00:59:59,305
Sobbing and moaning
to wake the dead.

644
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:03,017
"Why don't you kiss me good night?"
"Why don't you sing me a song?"

645
01:00:03,142 --> 01:00:05,520
"Why don't you love me
like before?"

646
01:00:05,645 --> 01:00:07,855
"You didn't notice my new dress."

647
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:10,608
"All you do
is turn over and snore."

648
01:00:10,817 --> 01:00:13,152
Damn it all!
Damn it all?

649
01:00:13,528 --> 01:00:15,947
She's gone now. Rejoice!

650
01:00:19,075 --> 01:00:22,453
I'll twist their noses off with pliers

651
01:00:22,578 --> 01:00:26,541
and bash their chests in
with a hammer.

652
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:31,462
I'll give them a nice little tap
on the head with a sledgehammer.

653
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:34,799
There he goes blubbering again.

654
01:00:36,134 --> 01:00:37,927
Maybe I love her.

655
01:00:38,052 --> 01:00:39,971
Maybe you love her?

656
01:00:40,096 --> 01:00:42,682
Listen,
you big misguided ham shank:

657
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:46,144
Love is nothing but lust,
lust, and more lust,

658
01:00:46,311 --> 01:00:50,398
with a lot of cheating, lies,
and general tomfoolery thrown in.

659
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,735
It hurts all the same.
Of course it does.

660
01:00:54,527 --> 01:00:56,529
Love is the blackest
of all plagues,

661
01:00:56,654 --> 01:00:59,282
and the only pleasure
would be to die of it.

662
01:00:59,407 --> 01:01:01,242
But it almost always passes.

663
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:03,453
No, mine won't.

664
01:01:03,578 --> 01:01:05,580
Yes, yours will too.

665
01:01:05,872 --> 01:01:09,334
Only a few wretched fools
die of love.

666
01:01:10,668 --> 01:01:14,047
If everything is imperfect
in this imperfect world,

667
01:01:14,172 --> 01:01:19,469
love is most perfect
in its perfect imperfection.

668
01:01:19,802 --> 01:01:23,556
You're lucky,
with that oiled jaw of yours.

669
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:26,142
You believe your own twaddle.

670
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:28,519
Who says I believe it?

671
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:31,689
But ask for a word of advice
and I'll give you two.

672
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:34,025
I'm a man of learning, after all.

673
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:38,654
Jons, could I go with you
through the forest?

674
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,740
I'm so lonely...

675
01:01:40,865 --> 01:01:44,035
and they'll just laugh
at me at home.

676
01:01:44,827 --> 01:01:48,289
Just don't blubber all the time,
or we'll leave you behind.

677
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:02,720
Little brother!

678
01:02:03,388 --> 01:02:06,766
Watch out, Jons!
That one's a fighter, and off his rocker.

679
01:02:06,891 --> 01:02:08,935
Right now he's a sniveler.

680
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,978
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

681
01:02:11,104 --> 01:02:14,023
I have such
a confounded temper.

682
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:15,817
Shake hands.

683
01:02:19,529 --> 01:02:21,364
Give me a hug, little brother.

684
01:02:21,489 --> 01:02:23,491
Thanks. Maybe later.

685
01:02:23,616 --> 01:02:27,078
We're in a hurry at the moment.
But thanks.

686
01:03:17,545 --> 01:03:18,588
Look!

687
01:03:18,963 --> 01:03:21,215
What's this I see?
You see something?

688
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:24,093
Who's that I spy
at the forest's edge

689
01:03:24,385 --> 01:03:28,181
if not my own dearly beloved
with actor in tow!

690
01:03:51,037 --> 01:03:52,330
Watch out!

691
01:03:52,455 --> 01:03:56,918
It's the filthy smith
who insulted my beloved lady,

692
01:03:57,043 --> 01:03:59,170
the fair Kunigunda.

693
01:03:59,337 --> 01:04:00,838
What did you call her?

694
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:03,508
Kunigunda.
Are you deaf now too?

695
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:08,346
Her name is Lisa.
Strumpet Lisa.

696
01:04:08,554 --> 01:04:12,517
Rumpy, smutty, slutty Lisa.

697
01:04:12,725 --> 01:04:14,018
He's so vulgar!

698
01:04:14,352 --> 01:04:17,688
Or think of another word
yourself for "tramp"...

699
01:04:17,813 --> 01:04:19,690
you gilded shithead!

700
01:04:19,815 --> 01:04:21,359
Vulgar brute!

701
01:04:21,484 --> 01:04:24,612
You stubble-headed bastard
of seven mangy mongrels,

702
01:04:24,737 --> 01:04:27,281
if I were in your lice-infested rags,

703
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:31,118
I'd feel such boundless shame
about my own person

704
01:04:31,244 --> 01:04:35,540
that I would immediately rid nature
of my own mortifying countenance.

705
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:38,042
Be careful, you perfumed 

706
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:40,086
Dung heap.

707
01:04:41,254 --> 01:04:42,880
Dung heap.

708
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:45,883
Or else...

709
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:49,554
I'll blow you down to actors' hell
with one great fart...

710
01:04:50,555 --> 01:04:52,348
where you can sit and 

711
01:04:52,515 --> 01:04:54,267
Recite monologues.

712
01:04:54,392 --> 01:04:58,521
Recite monologues to each other
till dust runs out the devil's ears!

713
01:04:58,646 --> 01:04:59,730
Bravo!

714
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:04,694
And I'll prod you in the belly so hard
your guts will run out your ears.

715
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:07,905
And I'll punch you so hard

716
01:05:08,072 --> 01:05:11,951
that you'll never again perform
your tricks for Turks and cannibals.

717
01:05:13,244 --> 01:05:15,913
Why are you laughing?
This is serious.

718
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:20,459
In southern lands there are
human-like animals called apes.

719
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:23,713
What of it?
Just mentioning it.

720
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:25,923
My dear little Plog.

721
01:05:26,048 --> 01:05:27,425
What?

722
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,471
Darling Plog,
forgive me for everything.

723
01:05:32,597 --> 01:05:34,682
She'll start crying any minute.

724
01:05:35,308 --> 01:05:38,144
I have to cry.
It's just too dreadful.

725
01:05:38,269 --> 01:05:42,273
You can't imagine
how horribly that man deceived me.

726
01:05:42,481 --> 01:05:45,568
Look here, Kunigunda.
Truth be told 

727
01:05:45,693 --> 01:05:48,529
Next it'll be his favorite dish.

728
01:05:48,696 --> 01:05:51,240
Plog, when we get home,

729
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:55,119
I'll fix you pork dumplings
with rutabagas and lingonberries.

730
01:05:55,286 --> 01:05:59,332
That's your favorite,
isn't it, my dear little Plog?

731
01:05:59,457 --> 01:06:03,169
Yes, but first I have to kill him.

732
01:06:03,294 --> 01:06:07,089
Yes, do that.
Kill him good and proper.

733
01:06:08,466 --> 01:06:10,343
I can't stand him anymore.

734
01:06:10,468 --> 01:06:13,054
Good Lord,
why did you give us woman?

735
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:16,349
He's nothing
but a false beard, false teeth,

736
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:20,311
false smiles, and rehearsed lines,
empty as a jug.

737
01:06:20,728 --> 01:06:22,480
Just kill him!

738
01:06:23,689 --> 01:06:25,316
Dear Plog...

739
01:06:25,483 --> 01:06:29,695
if you thought I'd try to justify
my so-called reality, you were wrong.

740
01:06:29,862 --> 01:06:34,325
Kill me. I'll thank you afterward.
What's that?

741
01:06:34,909 --> 01:06:38,496
The actor sows emotional confusion 
that's half the battle.

742
01:06:38,621 --> 01:06:40,498
Don't just stand there gaping.

743
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:43,959
He has to put up a fight,
or I can't kill him.

744
01:06:44,085 --> 01:06:46,629
He has to at least provoke me.

745
01:06:47,672 --> 01:06:51,342
My friends, I will plunge
this dagger into my breast...

746
01:06:52,093 --> 01:06:56,806
and my unreality will soon be
transformed into a new, solid reality:

747
01:06:56,931 --> 01:06:59,684
an absolutely tangible corpse.

748
01:07:00,142 --> 01:07:03,521
Hold on a minute.
I didn't mean any harm.

749
01:07:03,813 --> 01:07:05,856
I forgive you, Kunigunda.

750
01:07:06,107 --> 01:07:07,775
Farewell, my friend.

751
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,735
Pray for me sometime.

752
01:07:26,293 --> 01:07:28,671
Oh, dear!

753
01:07:29,213 --> 01:07:31,382
I didn't mean it like that.

754
01:07:31,507 --> 01:07:33,509
I was beginning to like him.

755
01:07:33,676 --> 01:07:35,261
He's dead.

756
01:07:35,386 --> 01:07:38,305
Totally, enormously dead.
The deadest actor I've ever seen.

757
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:42,935
This is all terribly sad,
but it's his own fault, poor thing.

758
01:07:43,102 --> 01:07:45,396
And this is what I'm married to!

759
01:07:45,563 --> 01:07:48,315
Now you have
your little Lisa back.

760
01:07:49,608 --> 01:07:51,152
Happy now?

761
01:07:51,902 --> 01:07:53,529
Jons...

762
01:07:53,654 --> 01:07:56,949
just between you and me,
isn't life 

763
01:07:57,074 --> 01:07:58,868
Yes, it is.

764
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,245
But don't think about that now.

765
01:08:02,246 --> 01:08:04,832
It's crazy, that's what it is.

766
01:08:13,048 --> 01:08:15,009
I played that scene well.

767
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:17,803
I'm quite the actor.

768
01:08:21,474 --> 01:08:24,101
Now to find a tree
I can climb up...

769
01:08:25,686 --> 01:08:28,981
so no bears, wolves,
or ghosts can get me.

770
01:08:49,627 --> 01:08:52,463
Tomorrow I'll look for Jof and Mia,

771
01:08:52,797 --> 01:08:55,549
and off we'll go to Elsinore.

772
01:08:57,051 --> 01:08:59,345
I'll sing myself a little song.

773
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:03,265
<i>I am a little bird
who sings whate'er he will</i>

774
01:09:05,684 --> 01:09:07,812
Workmen in the forest.

775
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:17,613
They're cutting down my tree!

776
01:09:17,947 --> 01:09:22,493
Hey, you pupated pecker,
what are you doing to my tree?

777
01:09:22,785 --> 01:09:24,537
Can't you at least answer?

778
01:09:24,662 --> 01:09:27,164
Courtesy costs nothing.
Who are you?

779
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:32,294
I'm cutting down your tree
because your time is up.

780
01:09:33,379 --> 01:09:35,172
You can't. I don't have time!

781
01:09:35,297 --> 01:09:37,424
You don't say.

782
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,803
I have a performance!

783
01:09:40,928 --> 01:09:43,556
Canceled on account of death.

784
01:09:43,681 --> 01:09:45,182
But my contract!

785
01:09:45,307 --> 01:09:46,517
Terminated.

786
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:50,604
My family, my children 

787
01:09:50,771 --> 01:09:52,940
Skat, you should be ashamed!

788
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:56,193
Yes, I am ashamed.

789
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:01,907
Are there no reprieves
or exemptions for actors?

790
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:04,910
No, not in this case.

791
01:10:05,744 --> 01:10:07,246
No loopholes?

792
01:10:07,496 --> 01:10:08,998
No exceptions?

793
01:10:53,876 --> 01:10:56,587
The moon's come out
from behind the clouds.

794
01:10:58,005 --> 01:11:01,258
Good.
Now we'll see the road better.

795
01:11:01,717 --> 01:11:03,802
I don't like the moon tonight.

796
01:11:04,428 --> 01:11:06,263
The trees are so still.

797
01:11:06,639 --> 01:11:08,599
Because there's no breeze.

798
01:11:09,183 --> 01:11:13,270
He means they're unusually still.

799
01:11:13,896 --> 01:11:16,398
It's completely quiet.

800
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:20,736
If only we could hear a fox.
Or an owl.

801
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:23,030
Or a human voice...

802
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:26,200
besides our own.

803
01:11:54,478 --> 01:11:56,355
Where are you going?

804
01:11:56,772 --> 01:11:59,775
The execution grounds.
Ah, yes, the witch.

805
01:12:00,609 --> 01:12:04,238
Why burn her at night
when people need diversion?

806
01:12:04,363 --> 01:12:07,408
Shut up, by all the dev
by all the saints.

807
01:12:07,533 --> 01:12:09,702
The devil is with her.

808
01:12:09,827 --> 01:12:12,329
Then you're eight brave men.

809
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:16,417
We've been paid.
This is a volunteer job.

810
01:13:54,932 --> 01:13:56,100
Can you hear me?

811
01:13:58,852 --> 01:14:01,688
They say you've been
in league with the devil.

812
01:14:01,814 --> 01:14:03,482
Why do you ask?

813
01:14:03,607 --> 01:14:07,611
Not out of idle curiosity,
but for very personal reasons.

814
01:14:09,029 --> 01:14:10,823
I too want to meet him.

815
01:14:11,365 --> 01:14:13,242
Why?

816
01:14:14,493 --> 01:14:16,620
I want to ask him about God.

817
01:14:17,496 --> 01:14:19,331
He must know...

818
01:14:19,790 --> 01:14:21,583
or no one does.

819
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:25,254
You can see him
anytime you wish.

820
01:14:25,879 --> 01:14:27,047
How?

821
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:29,591
You must do as I say.

822
01:14:32,177 --> 01:14:33,971
Look into my eyes.

823
01:14:37,015 --> 01:14:41,061
Well, what do you see?
Do you see him?

824
01:14:41,395 --> 01:14:46,316
I see dumb terror in your eyes.

825
01:14:46,859 --> 01:14:48,527
Nothing else.

826
01:14:50,195 --> 01:14:54,366
No one? Nothing?

827
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:57,161
No.

828
01:14:58,787 --> 01:15:00,831
Isn't that him behind you?

829
01:15:04,084 --> 01:15:05,252
No.

830
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:07,838
There's no one there.

831
01:15:11,133 --> 01:15:13,135
He's with me everywhere.

832
01:15:13,385 --> 01:15:17,181
I need only reach out my hand
and I feel his.

833
01:15:17,514 --> 01:15:19,474
He's with me even now.

834
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,727
The fire won't hurt me.

835
01:15:21,852 --> 01:15:23,812
Did he say that?
I know.

836
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:27,149
Did he say that?
I know!

837
01:15:27,691 --> 01:15:29,943
You must see him too.

838
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:34,114
The priests could see him,
and the soldiers too.

839
01:15:34,281 --> 01:15:37,284
They're so afraid of him
that they dare not touch me.

840
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,626
Why did you crush her hands?

841
01:15:45,751 --> 01:15:47,920
It wasn't us.
Who, then?

842
01:15:48,212 --> 01:15:50,130
Ask the monk over there.

843
01:15:52,424 --> 01:15:54,384
What did you do to that girl?

844
01:15:59,598 --> 01:16:01,725
Do you never stop asking questions?

845
01:16:03,227 --> 01:16:04,394
No.

846
01:16:05,437 --> 01:16:07,231
Never.

847
01:16:07,773 --> 01:16:09,733
Yet you get no answers.

848
01:16:27,251 --> 01:16:29,962
I thought we might kill
all the soldiers,

849
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,631
but she's nearly dead already.

850
01:16:32,756 --> 01:16:35,926
I told you to be careful!
Don't go near her!

851
01:16:46,895 --> 01:16:48,480
Take this.

852
01:16:48,605 --> 01:16:50,440
It will stop the pain.

853
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:53,920
What does she see?
Can you answer that?

854
01:17:54,046 --> 01:17:57,507
She feels no pain now.
You didn't answer my question.

855
01:17:57,758 --> 01:17:59,885
Who's watching over that child?

856
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:02,596
The angels? God? Satan?

857
01:18:03,013 --> 01:18:04,723
Or just emptiness?

858
01:18:04,931 --> 01:18:07,851
Emptiness, sire.
That can't be!

859
01:18:08,477 --> 01:18:09,853
Look in her eyes.

860
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,482
Her poor brain's
just made a discovery:

861
01:18:13,774 --> 01:18:15,609
emptiness in the moonlight.

862
01:18:15,776 --> 01:18:16,902
No!

863
01:18:17,611 --> 01:18:20,364
We stand by helpless,
arms hanging at our sides,

864
01:18:20,489 --> 01:18:24,326
for we see what she sees,
and her terror is ours.

865
01:18:25,369 --> 01:18:26,953
Poor child.

866
01:18:27,996 --> 01:18:29,873
I can't stand it!

867
01:19:46,074 --> 01:19:50,829
<i>He sings so sweetly
of Jesus Christ</i>

868
01:19:51,079 --> 01:19:56,626
<i>And there's
great rejoicing on high</i>

869
01:19:57,627 --> 01:19:59,629
It will soon be dawn...

870
01:20:00,297 --> 01:20:03,467
but the heat hangs in the air
like a damp blanket.

871
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,969
I'm so afraid!

872
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:09,514
We know something's going
to happen to us,

873
01:20:09,639 --> 01:20:11,391
but we don't know what.

874
01:20:12,601 --> 01:20:14,311
Judgment Day, perhaps.

875
01:20:14,478 --> 01:20:16,146
Judgment Day.

876
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:29,284
<i>Give me some water!</i>

877
01:20:32,704 --> 01:20:34,706
I have the plague!

878
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:36,833
Don't come past that stump.

879
01:20:42,756 --> 01:20:44,883
I'm afraid of dying!

880
01:20:45,175 --> 01:20:47,719
I don't want to die!

881
01:20:53,808 --> 01:20:56,102
Won't you have pity on me?

882
01:20:56,353 --> 01:20:57,812
Help me.

883
01:20:58,939 --> 01:21:01,483
At least talk to me!

884
01:21:07,197 --> 01:21:08,907
It's no use.

885
01:21:09,407 --> 01:21:11,368
Absolutely no use.

886
01:21:12,035 --> 01:21:14,287
I'm sure of that.

887
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:22,295
I'm dying. I'm...

888
01:21:26,049 --> 01:21:28,218
What will happen to me?

889
01:21:29,219 --> 01:21:31,346
Will no one console me?

890
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:34,474
Have you no compassion?

891
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:37,060
Can't you see that I'm 

892
01:21:38,186 --> 01:21:41,481
Will no one help me?
Just a little water.

893
01:21:42,607 --> 01:21:44,067
It's pointless.

894
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:46,570
Utterly pointless.

895
01:21:47,487 --> 01:21:50,240
I tell you, it's pointless.

896
01:21:50,865 --> 01:21:52,284
Help me!

897
01:21:52,409 --> 01:21:54,911
Don't you see
I'm trying to console you?

898
01:22:21,354 --> 01:22:23,940
<i>Shall we finish our game?</i>

899
01:22:24,608 --> 01:22:26,192
It's your move.

900
01:22:34,451 --> 01:22:36,494
I take your queen.

901
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:38,455
I didn't see that.

902
01:22:53,595 --> 01:22:55,972
What is it?
I see something dreadful.

903
01:22:56,139 --> 01:22:58,933
I can hardly even tell you.
What is it?

904
01:22:59,059 --> 01:23:01,353
The knight is
playing chess over there.

905
01:23:01,853 --> 01:23:04,522
So I see.
Nothing dreadful about that.

906
01:23:04,648 --> 01:23:06,608
Don't you see who he's playing?

907
01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:08,860
He's all alone.
You mustn't scare me 

908
01:23:09,027 --> 01:23:11,029
No, he's not alone.

909
01:23:12,072 --> 01:23:14,491
Who's with him?
Death.

910
01:23:14,824 --> 01:23:17,410
He's playing chess
with Death himself.

911
01:23:17,911 --> 01:23:19,579
You mustn't say such things.

912
01:23:19,704 --> 01:23:21,706
We have to get out of here.

913
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:24,626
We can't do that.
We have to try.

914
01:23:24,751 --> 01:23:28,672
They're engrossed in their game.
They won't notice if we slip away.

915
01:23:34,594 --> 01:23:36,971
Your move, Antonius Block.

916
01:23:41,518 --> 01:23:43,520
Have you lost interest in our game?

917
01:23:44,688 --> 01:23:46,356
Lost interest?

918
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:49,025
On the contrary.

919
01:23:49,734 --> 01:23:53,530
You look anxious.
Are you hiding something?

920
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:57,367
Nothing escapes you, does it?

921
01:23:57,909 --> 01:23:59,786
Nothing escapes me.

922
01:24:00,662 --> 01:24:02,706
No one escapes me.

923
01:24:03,998 --> 01:24:06,000
I am worried, it's true.

924
01:24:07,544 --> 01:24:09,212
You're afraid.

925
01:24:17,345 --> 01:24:19,389
I've forgotten
how the pieces were.

926
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,727
I haven't.

927
01:24:25,687 --> 01:24:27,981
You can't get off that easily.

928
01:24:37,323 --> 01:24:39,826
I see something interesting.
What do you see?

929
01:24:42,412 --> 01:24:44,539
Mate at the next move.

930
01:24:48,585 --> 01:24:49,669
True.

931
01:24:51,921 --> 01:24:53,590
Was your reprieve of some use?

932
01:24:54,257 --> 01:24:56,259
Yes, it was.

933
01:24:57,218 --> 01:24:58,762
I'm glad.

934
01:25:00,388 --> 01:25:02,056
I'll be leaving you now.

935
01:25:03,099 --> 01:25:05,101
When next we meet...

936
01:25:05,226 --> 01:25:08,229
you and your companions' time
will be up.

937
01:25:11,441 --> 01:25:13,359
Will you reveal your secrets then?

938
01:25:14,402 --> 01:25:16,362
I have no secrets.

939
01:25:17,071 --> 01:25:19,574
So you know nothing?

940
01:25:20,742 --> 01:25:22,202
I know nothing.

941
01:25:45,558 --> 01:25:47,602
What a strange light.

942
01:25:47,852 --> 01:25:50,480
It's the thunderstorm
that comes at dawn.

943
01:25:51,231 --> 01:25:53,775
No, it's something else,
something terrible.

944
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:55,735
You hear that roaring
in the forest?

945
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:57,445
Probably the rain.

946
01:25:57,570 --> 01:25:59,489
No, it's not the rain.

947
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:02,534
He saw us. He's chasing us.

948
01:26:02,659 --> 01:26:05,161
He's caught up!
He's coming toward us!

949
01:26:18,842 --> 01:26:21,553
Climb inside, Mia! Quick!

950
01:26:27,517 --> 01:26:31,312
The Angel of Death is passing by...

951
01:26:31,688 --> 01:26:33,815
and he's very large.

952
01:26:34,107 --> 01:26:35,900
You feel how cold it is?

953
01:28:39,649 --> 01:28:43,528
I heard from returning crusaders
that you were on your way home.

954
01:28:44,696 --> 01:28:46,656
I waited for you here.

955
01:28:46,781 --> 01:28:48,825
The others all fled from the plague.

956
01:28:55,748 --> 01:28:58,209
Don't you recognize me anymore?

957
01:29:03,006 --> 01:29:05,008
You've changed too.

958
01:29:12,724 --> 01:29:14,934
Now I can see it's you.

959
01:29:16,602 --> 01:29:18,688
Somewhere in your eyes...

960
01:29:20,481 --> 01:29:22,775
somewhere in your face...

961
01:29:23,234 --> 01:29:26,279
only hidden and frightened...

962
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:31,367
is the boy who went away
so many years ago.

963
01:29:33,327 --> 01:29:35,204
That's all over now...

964
01:29:35,621 --> 01:29:37,707
and I'm a little tired.

965
01:29:38,499 --> 01:29:40,376
Do you regret having gone?

966
01:29:40,877 --> 01:29:42,295
No...

967
01:29:42,879 --> 01:29:44,630
I regret nothing.

968
01:29:45,757 --> 01:29:47,550
But I'm a little tired.

969
01:29:52,388 --> 01:29:54,307
I can see that.

970
01:30:02,273 --> 01:30:04,692
My friends are over there.

971
01:30:07,862 --> 01:30:11,866
Have them come in.
I'll set the table for breakfast.

972
01:30:16,871 --> 01:30:20,958
<i>"And when the Lamb
had opened the seventh seal...</i>

973
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:24,837
<i>there was silence in heaven</i>

974
01:30:25,254 --> 01:30:28,508
about the space of half an hour.

975
01:30:29,467 --> 01:30:31,803
And the seven angels

976
01:30:32,095 --> 01:30:34,889
who had the seven trumpets

977
01:30:35,181 --> 01:30:39,352
prepared themselves to sound.

978
01:30:51,114 --> 01:30:54,700
The first angel
sounded his trumpet...

979
01:30:55,284 --> 01:30:59,455
and there followed
hail and fire mingled with blood...

980
01:30:59,914 --> 01:31:03,126
and they were cast upon the earth.

981
01:31:03,626 --> 01:31:07,630
And a third part of the earth
was burnt up...

982
01:31:08,422 --> 01:31:12,802
and a third part of the trees
was burnt up...

983
01:31:13,553 --> 01:31:17,140
and all the green grass
was burnt up.

984
01:31:18,850 --> 01:31:22,979
And the second angel
sounded his trumpet...

985
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:28,025
and as it were a great mountain
burning with fire

986
01:31:28,151 --> 01:31:30,945
was cast into the sea.

987
01:31:31,195 --> 01:31:35,658
And a third part of the sea
became blood."

988
01:31:35,783 --> 01:31:37,285
Was anyone there?

989
01:31:42,999 --> 01:31:45,334
No, sire. I saw no one.

990
01:31:49,839 --> 01:31:53,217
"And the third angel

991
01:31:53,342 --> 01:31:55,178
sounded his trumpet...

992
01:31:56,012 --> 01:31:59,473
and there fell
a great star from heaven...

993
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:03,895
burning as if it were a lamp.

994
01:32:05,021 --> 01:32:10,026
And the name of the star
is called Wormwood."

995
01:32:45,561 --> 01:32:47,730
Good morning, noble lord.

996
01:32:49,565 --> 01:32:52,944
I am Karin, the knight's wife,

997
01:32:53,236 --> 01:32:56,322
and I bid you welcome to my house.

998
01:32:57,782 --> 01:33:00,326
I'm a smith by trade,

999
01:33:00,451 --> 01:33:03,579
and quite good,
if I say so myself.

1000
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,082
My wife Lisa.

1001
01:33:06,832 --> 01:33:09,335
Curtsy to the noble lord, Lisa.

1002
01:33:11,003 --> 01:33:15,424
She's a handful sometimes,
and we had a little spat,

1003
01:33:15,549 --> 01:33:18,261
but no worse than most people.

1004
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:22,431
Out of our darkness
we call to thee, O Lord.

1005
01:33:22,890 --> 01:33:25,935
O God, have mercy on us,

1006
01:33:26,269 --> 01:33:29,730
for we are small
and frightened and ignorant.

1007
01:33:29,855 --> 01:33:32,483
In the darkness
where you claim to be,

1008
01:33:32,608 --> 01:33:35,027
where all of us probably are,

1009
01:33:35,152 --> 01:33:39,782
there's no one to hear your cries
or be moved by your suffering.

1010
01:33:40,491 --> 01:33:43,786
Dry your tears and mirror yourself
in your own indifference.

1011
01:33:43,953 --> 01:33:48,457
God, you who are somewhere,
who must be somewhere...

1012
01:33:49,166 --> 01:33:50,960
have mercy on us.

1013
01:33:51,419 --> 01:33:54,755
My herbs could have purged you
of your anxieties about eternity,

1014
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,674
but now it's too late.

1015
01:33:56,841 --> 01:33:59,343
Even so, feel the immense triumph
of this final moment,

1016
01:33:59,468 --> 01:34:01,971
when you can still roll your eyes
and wiggle your toes.

1017
01:34:02,138 --> 01:34:04,098
Quiet, quiet.

1018
01:34:04,223 --> 01:34:07,226
I will be quiet, but under protest!

1019
01:34:28,873 --> 01:34:30,833
It is finished.

1020
01:35:25,596 --> 01:35:28,432
I see them, Mia.

1021
01:35:29,517 --> 01:35:32,019
Over there,
under the dark, stormy sky.

1022
01:35:32,478 --> 01:35:34,397
They're all there:

1023
01:35:34,647 --> 01:35:36,482
the smith and Lisa,

1024
01:35:36,732 --> 01:35:39,568
the knight, Raval,
Jons, and Skat.

1025
01:35:40,403 --> 01:35:44,407
And Death, the grim master,
bids them dance.

1026
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:47,576
He commands them to hold hands

1027
01:35:47,952 --> 01:35:50,704
and dance in a long line.

1028
01:35:51,705 --> 01:35:55,918
The stern master leads the way
with his scythe and hourglass.

1029
01:35:56,502 --> 01:36:00,256
But Skat dangles
at the end with his lyre.

1030
01:36:01,424 --> 01:36:05,136
They dance away from the dawn

1031
01:36:05,761 --> 01:36:07,680
in a solemn dance,

1032
01:36:08,431 --> 01:36:10,808
away to the dark country,

1033
01:36:11,434 --> 01:36:14,228
while the rain runs down
over their faces...

1034
01:36:15,187 --> 01:36:18,482
and washes away
their salty tears.

1035
01:36:23,112 --> 01:36:25,448
You and your visions.
