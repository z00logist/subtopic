00:00:48,603 --> 00:00:50,731
<i>In our relations with other people,</i>

2
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:54,899
<i>we mainly discuss and evaluate</i>

3
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:57,637
<i>their character and behavior.</i>

4
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:03,209
<i>That is why I have withdrawn</i>

5
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:05,979
<i>from nearly all so-called relations.</i>

6
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:12,155
<i>This has made my old age</i>
<i>rather lonely.</i>

7
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,689
<i>My life has been full of hard work,</i>
<i>and I am grateful.</i>

8
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:22,531
<i>It began as toil</i>
<i>for bread and butter</i>

9
00:01:22,638 --> 00:01:27,405
<i>and ended in a love for science.</i>

10
00:01:27,975 --> 00:01:33,709
<i>I have a son, also a doctor,</i>
<i>who lives in Lund.</i>

11
00:01:33,814 --> 00:01:38,808
<i>He has been married for many years.</i>
<i>They have no children.</i>

12
00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:45,481
<i>My old mother is still alive</i>
<i>and is very active, in spite of her age.</i>

13
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:55,433
<i>My wife Karin</i>
<i>has been dead for many years.</i>

14
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,835
Dinner is served, Professor Borg.

15
00:02:02,376 --> 00:02:04,469
Thank you.

16
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:07,776
<i>I am lucky</i>
<i>in having a good housekeeper.</i>

17
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,384
<i>Perhaps I should add</i>
<i>that I am an old pedant,</i>

18
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:17,718
<i>which at times</i>
<i>has been rather trying</i>

19
00:02:17,825 --> 00:02:22,786
<i>for myself and those around me.</i>

20
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,131
<i>My name is Isak Borg,</i>

21
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,504
<i>and I am 78.</i>

22
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:38,068
<i>Tomorrow I shall receive</i>
<i>an honorary degree in Lund Cathedral.</i>

00:02:53,427 --> 00:02:56,727
WI LD STRAWBERRI ES

24
00:03:57,526 --> 00:04:00,757
<i>In the early hours ofJune 1 st,</i>

25
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:04,957
<i>I had a weird</i>
<i>and very unpleasant dream.</i>

26
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:09,325
<i>I dreamt that during</i>
<i>my morning walk</i>

27
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:14,966
<i>I lost my way among empty streets</i>

28
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:17,567
<i>with ruined houses.</i>

29
00:09:27,956 --> 00:09:29,048
Are you ill?

30
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:32,888
Miss Agda, please prepare
some breakfast. I'm taking the car.

31
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:37,225
Please, Professor! Go back to bed
and I'll bring you coffee at 9:00,

32
00:09:37,331 --> 00:09:40,630
and we'll leave at 10:00 as planned.

33
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:43,067
Oh, well, I'll go without breakfast.

34
00:09:45,472 --> 00:09:47,168
And who will pack your tails?

35
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:51,309
- I will do it myself.
- And what about me?

36
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:58,312
You can come in the car or fly.
Please yourself.

37
00:09:58,418 --> 00:10:03,048
I've looked forward to seeing you get
your honorary degree.

38
00:10:03,158 --> 00:10:07,025
And we had arranged
everything so nicely,

39
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:10,427
and now you're taking the car.

40
00:10:10,532 --> 00:10:13,159
The ceremony isn't until 5:00.

41
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:16,794
If I leave at once, I've got 14 hours
before the ceremony.

42
00:10:16,904 --> 00:10:19,373
You'll ruin everything!

43
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:24,101
What about your son who is expecting you
at the airport in Malmo?

44
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:28,171
You can think up an explanation.

45
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:34,212
If you go by car,
I won't come at all.

46
00:10:35,557 --> 00:10:37,649
Now listen, Miss Agda!

47
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,787
Take the car, and you'll ruin
the greatest day of my life.

48
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:45,331
We're not married, Miss Agda.

49
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:49,995
I thank God for that every night.

50
00:10:50,104 --> 00:10:54,563
I've used my common sense for 74 years,
and it won't let me down now.

51
00:10:54,676 --> 00:10:57,167
Is that your last word?

52
00:10:57,278 --> 00:10:59,211
Yes.

53
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:06,910
But I shall say plenty to myself
about selfish, crabby old men

54
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:12,583
who never think of those who have
served them faithfully for 40 years.

55
00:11:12,693 --> 00:11:15,686
Incredible that I have put up...

56
00:11:15,797 --> 00:11:20,666
with your bossing for so long.

57
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:24,203
Just give the word,
and I'll leave tomorrow.

58
00:11:24,304 --> 00:11:29,743
I'm going by car anyway,
and you can do as you damn well please.

59
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:42,578
I happen to be grown-up
and needn't take orders from you.

60
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:50,123
No one can pack like you, Miss Agda.

61
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,028
Really?

62
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,567
Old sourpuss.

63
00:11:54,668 --> 00:11:56,602
Shall I boil you a couple of eggs?

64
00:11:56,703 --> 00:12:01,140
Yes, please, if you will be
so extremely kind.

65
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:11,514
The faculty should have made me
honorary idiot.

66
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:18,956
I'll calm the old girl down
with a present.

67
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:21,755
I hate resentful people.

68
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:26,458
I wouldn't hurt a fly,
let alone Miss Agda.

69
00:12:27,534 --> 00:12:29,162
Toast?

70
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:31,465
No, don't trouble yourself
on my account.

71
00:12:31,572 --> 00:12:34,472
What are <i>you</i> cross about?

72
00:12:40,214 --> 00:12:41,908
Don't you want a cup?

73
00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:49,620
Good morning, Uncle Isak.

74
00:12:49,724 --> 00:12:54,423
Well, well, why is my daughter-in-law
up at this hour?

75
00:12:54,528 --> 00:12:58,124
Who can sleep when you and Aunt Agda
are making such a row?

76
00:12:58,231 --> 00:13:00,529
There has been no row.

77
00:13:00,634 --> 00:13:02,330
No, not at all.

78
00:13:04,272 --> 00:13:06,263
You're taking the car to Lund?

79
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:07,398
Yes.

80
00:13:07,508 --> 00:13:09,236
Can I come with you?

81
00:13:09,344 --> 00:13:10,868
You're going home?

82
00:13:10,977 --> 00:13:13,811
Yes, I want to go home.

83
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:15,644
Home to Evald?

84
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,376
You don't need to ask why.

85
00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:20,147
I would take the train
if I could afford it.

86
00:13:20,254 --> 00:13:22,518
Of course you may ride with me.

87
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:24,147
I'll be ready in ten minutes.

88
00:13:27,794 --> 00:13:29,352
Good heavens!

89
00:13:57,692 --> 00:14:02,095
Please don't smoke.
I can't stand cigarette smoke.

90
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:03,595
I forgot.

91
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:06,996
There should be a law
forbidding women to smoke.

92
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:09,464
Beautiful weather.

93
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,370
Yes, but sultry.

94
00:14:14,142 --> 00:14:16,610
- I think we'll have a thunderstorm.
- So do I.

95
00:14:16,711 --> 00:14:18,337
No, give me a cigar anytime.

96
00:14:18,446 --> 00:14:21,745
That's stimulating and relaxing.
That's a vice for men.

97
00:14:21,849 --> 00:14:24,817
And what vices may a woman have?

98
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:28,047
Weeping, giving birth
and speaking ill of her neighbors.

99
00:14:28,155 --> 00:14:30,919
How old are you really, Uncle Isak?

100
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:32,389
Why do you ask?

101
00:14:32,493 --> 00:14:34,255
No reason. Why?

102
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:37,263
I know why you asked.

103
00:14:37,365 --> 00:14:39,389
Oh, well.

104
00:14:41,735 --> 00:14:45,729
Don't pretend.
You don't like me. You never have.

105
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,274
I only know you
as a father-in-law.

106
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,366
Why are you going home?

107
00:14:50,477 --> 00:14:52,378
On impulse. Nothing more.

108
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,744
Evald happens to be my son.

109
00:14:54,849 --> 00:14:56,282
So he is.

110
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:59,841
Evald and I are very much alike.
We have our principles.

111
00:14:59,953 --> 00:15:01,818
You don't need to tell me <i>that.</i>

112
00:15:01,923 --> 00:15:03,322
Now, this loan, for instance.

113
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,288
I know exactly
what you're going to say.

114
00:15:05,393 --> 00:15:08,089
He should have paid it back
when he became an associate professor.

115
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:10,755
It's a matter of honor for him
to pay back 5,000 a year,

116
00:15:10,865 --> 00:15:12,196
and so on, and so on.

117
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:14,234
A promise is a promise.

118
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:17,168
For us, it means
that we never can be free together,

119
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,171
and that your son
works himself to death.

120
00:15:19,273 --> 00:15:21,639
You have your own income.

121
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:23,606
Especially when one considers
the fact that you're filthy rich

122
00:15:23,711 --> 00:15:25,076
and don't need the money.

123
00:15:25,178 --> 00:15:30,775
A promise is a promise.
And I know Evald respects that.

124
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:34,253
Perhaps.
But he also hates you.

125
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:48,067
What do you have against me?

126
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:49,864
Shall I be frank?

127
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:51,302
Yes, I'm asking you.

128
00:15:52,606 --> 00:15:55,167
You're a selfish old man, Uncle Isak.

129
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:59,735
You're utterly ruthless
and never listen to anyone but yourself.

130
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:05,808
But you hide it all behind
your old-world manners and charm.

131
00:16:06,821 --> 00:16:12,316
Beneath your benevolent exterior,
you're as hard as nails.

132
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:17,629
But you can't fool us
who have seen you at close quarters.

133
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:22,163
Remember when
I came to you a month ago?

134
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,738
I had a stupid idea
that you might help Evald and me.

135
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:29,308
So I asked to stay with you
for a week or two.

136
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:31,878
Remember what you answered?

137
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:35,004
I said I'd be delighted.

138
00:16:36,283 --> 00:16:39,720
Perhaps you've forgotten,
but you said,

139
00:16:40,788 --> 00:16:44,849
"Don't try to draw me
into your marital squabbles.

140
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:46,687
I don't give a damn.

141
00:16:46,793 --> 00:16:48,784
You and Evald must make
the best of it."

142
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,453
Did I say that?

143
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:53,830
- Not only that.
- Oh, no.

144
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:55,629
These were your very words:

145
00:16:56,537 --> 00:16:58,869
"I have no respect
for mental suffering,

146
00:16:58,972 --> 00:17:00,907
so don't come lamenting to <i>me.</i>

147
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:06,441
If you need therapy,
you'd better see a shrink.

148
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:10,142
Or why not a minister?
It's in fashion now."

149
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,980
Did I say that?

150
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:15,679
Your judgments are very categorical,
Uncle Isak.

151
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:19,191
I should hate to depend on you.

152
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,523
I have liked having you
about the house.

153
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:29,329
Like a cat.

154
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:31,803
A cat or a human being.

155
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:37,138
You're a fine young woman,
and I'm sorry you dislike me.

156
00:17:37,243 --> 00:17:39,905
- I don't dislike you.
- Really?

157
00:17:40,013 --> 00:17:42,243
- I feel sorry for you.
- Sorry?

158
00:17:46,953 --> 00:17:50,980
I'd like to tell you about a dream
I had this morning.

159
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:53,390
I'm not very interested in dreams.

160
00:17:53,493 --> 00:17:57,362
No. No, of course not.

161
00:18:10,544 --> 00:18:12,535
Where are you going now?

162
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:15,207
I want to show you something.

163
00:18:48,182 --> 00:18:53,711
We lived here every summer
during the first 20 years of my life.

164
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,382
There were ten of us children.
Perhaps you knew that.

165
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,383
Does anyone live here now?

166
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:02,222
No, not this summer.

167
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,028
I'll go swimming, if you don't mind.
We have plenty of time.

168
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:10,660
Yes, by all means, do.

169
00:19:23,683 --> 00:19:26,550
The place where
wild strawberries grow!

170
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,633
<i>Perhaps I got a little sentimental.</i>

171
00:19:43,871 --> 00:19:46,601
<i>Perhaps I got a little tired</i>

172
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:49,300
<i>and felt a bit sad.</i>

173
00:19:50,944 --> 00:19:56,247
<i>It's not impossible that I began</i>
<i>to think of this and that,</i>

174
00:19:56,349 --> 00:20:00,012
<i>associated with places</i>
<i>where I played as a child.</i>

175
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:03,788
<i>I don't know how it happened,</i>

176
00:20:04,825 --> 00:20:07,316
<i>but the day's clear reality</i>

177
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:12,593
<i>dissolved into the even clearer</i>
<i>images of memory</i>

178
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,191
<i>that appeared before my eyes</i>

179
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:18,169
<i>with the strength</i>
<i>of a true stream of events.</i>

180
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:36,451
Sara.

181
00:20:39,492 --> 00:20:41,188
Sara,

182
00:20:41,895 --> 00:20:44,261
it's your cousin Isak.

183
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,993
Well, I've become quite old,
of course, so I don't look the same.

184
00:20:52,071 --> 00:20:57,806
But you, you haven't changed at all.

185
00:21:03,717 --> 00:21:06,652
Good morning, sweet cousin.
What are you doing?

186
00:21:06,753 --> 00:21:08,949
Picking strawberries, silly.
Can't you see?

187
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:12,551
And who shall be favored
with these delicious berries

188
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,425
picked in the early morn
by a lovely young woman?

189
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:19,931
Nonsense. You know quite well
that it's Uncle Aron's name day today.

190
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:22,400
I forgot to make a present.

191
00:21:22,502 --> 00:21:25,131
So he'll get a basket
of wild strawberries instead.

192
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:26,398
I'll help you.

193
00:21:26,507 --> 00:21:30,034
You see, Sigbritt and Charlotta made
a tapestry and Angelica baked a cake,

194
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:31,873
and Anna has painted
a really good picture,

195
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:35,005
and Kristina and Birgitta
wrote a song that they'll sing to him.

196
00:21:35,115 --> 00:21:38,141
That's the best one.
Uncle Aron is stone-deaf.

197
00:21:38,251 --> 00:21:41,085
He'll be very pleased,
and you're stupid.

198
00:21:41,188 --> 00:21:43,622
And you have a darned cute nape.

199
00:21:46,093 --> 00:21:47,616
You know you shouldn't do that.

200
00:21:47,728 --> 00:21:50,219
- Says who?
- <i>I</i> say.

201
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,027
Besides, you're an unusually
insufferable young man

202
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:54,794
who thinks he's really something.

203
00:21:54,902 --> 00:21:57,233
I'm your cousin,
and you're in love with me.

204
00:21:58,172 --> 00:21:59,400
With you!

205
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:02,499
Come and be kissed on the lips.

206
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:07,807
If you don't behave, I'll tell Isak
you're always trying to kiss me.

207
00:22:07,914 --> 00:22:11,442
Little Isak! I could beat him up
with one arm.

208
00:22:12,118 --> 00:22:14,916
You know quite well that Isak and I
are secretly engaged.

209
00:22:15,021 --> 00:22:18,719
So secretly, everyone knows it.

210
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:21,852
It's not my fault that the twins
let the cat out of the bag.

211
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:25,954
When is the wedding?
When is the wedding?

212
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,938
I don't know which of you four brothers
is the least conceited,

213
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:34,404
but I think it's Isak.

214
00:22:34,508 --> 00:22:36,066
Isak is the nicest, anyway.

215
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:38,837
And you're the horridest, nastiest,

216
00:22:38,945 --> 00:22:43,815
silliest, stupidest...
I can't find the words to describe you!

217
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:47,011
Admit you've got
a weak spot for me.

218
00:22:47,121 --> 00:22:49,487
And you reek of cigars.

219
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:51,353
It's a nice manly smell.

220
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:57,386
And the twins,
who know <i>most</i> things,

221
00:22:57,498 --> 00:23:02,333
say you've been up to no good
with that Berglund girl.

222
00:23:02,435 --> 00:23:07,806
She's not a nice girl, the twins say.
And I agree.

223
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:11,275
How pretty you are
when you blush.

224
00:23:11,377 --> 00:23:14,643
You <i>must</i> kiss me.
I can't bear it any longer.

225
00:23:14,748 --> 00:23:19,116
Now that I think of it,
I'm madly in love with you.

226
00:23:19,219 --> 00:23:21,413
- You're just saying that.
- No.

227
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:26,420
And the twins say

228
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:29,654
that you're <i>mad</i> about girls.

229
00:23:29,863 --> 00:23:31,490
Is that true?

230
00:23:41,307 --> 00:23:43,935
Oh, look what you've done!

231
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:49,310
And what will Isak say,
who really loves me?

232
00:23:50,483 --> 00:23:54,978
I'm so sad!
You've hurt me so!

233
00:23:56,656 --> 00:23:59,090
You've made
a bad woman of me.

234
00:23:59,192 --> 00:24:01,218
At any rate, <i>nearly.</i>

235
00:24:01,327 --> 00:24:04,888
I never want to see you again,
at least not before brunch.

236
00:24:05,332 --> 00:24:08,824
I have to hurry.
Help me pick up the strawberries.

237
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:12,500
Oh, and now I've got
a stain on my apron!

238
00:24:41,902 --> 00:24:45,462
Where's Isak?

239
00:24:46,173 --> 00:24:50,973
Out fishing with Papa,
and they can't hear the gong.

240
00:24:51,077 --> 00:24:57,038
Anyway, Papa said
not to wait with brunch.

241
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:49,128
In Jesus' name
we take our seat.

242
00:25:49,236 --> 00:25:52,672
Bless, O Lord,
this food we eat. Amen.

243
00:26:01,515 --> 00:26:04,643
Benjamin, go and wash
your hands at once.

244
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,652
How old do you have to be
to learn cleanliness?

245
00:26:07,753 --> 00:26:09,278
I <i>have.</i>

246
00:26:10,124 --> 00:26:13,820
Sigbritt, pass Angelica the porridge.

247
00:26:13,926 --> 00:26:17,294
Your fingernails are filthy.

248
00:26:18,265 --> 00:26:19,663
Hagbart, pass the bread.

249
00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:24,829
Don't take so much butter.

250
00:26:24,938 --> 00:26:28,931
Charlotta, the salt is lumpy.
You let it get damp.

251
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:31,134
How often have I told you
not to let it sit out?

252
00:26:31,244 --> 00:26:34,509
It's <i>paint</i> under my nails.

253
00:26:34,615 --> 00:26:36,412
Who gathered
the wild strawberries for me?

254
00:26:36,517 --> 00:26:39,008
- I did.
- What?

255
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,183
Speak up, dear.
Uncle Aron can't hear.

256
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:47,124
I did!

257
00:26:47,227 --> 00:26:50,855
Fancy your remembering
my name day.

258
00:26:50,963 --> 00:26:53,193
How kind of you.

259
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:58,199
Couldn't Uncle have a drink
to celebrate?

260
00:26:58,305 --> 00:27:01,000
Never when Papa is not at home.

261
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:05,107
Uncle has already had three drinks.

262
00:27:05,211 --> 00:27:09,114
We saw him when we went out
to bathe at 8:00.

263
00:27:09,215 --> 00:27:11,513
So you've picked berries too.
Thank you.

264
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:14,415
Twins, speak when spoken to.

265
00:27:16,022 --> 00:27:19,480
And as you didn't make your beds,
you can dry the silver.

266
00:27:20,894 --> 00:27:23,727
You will do as Auntie says.

267
00:27:23,829 --> 00:27:26,526
Benjamin, don't bite your nails.

268
00:27:26,633 --> 00:27:30,160
Anna, what are you doing?
Remember you're not a little girl anymore.

269
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:32,170
I want to give Uncle my picture.

270
00:27:32,271 --> 00:27:35,036
Please, Auntie, can't we give him
our presents now?

271
00:27:35,142 --> 00:27:36,904
- Where is your present?
- Under the table.

272
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:38,704
No, after we've eaten.

273
00:27:40,012 --> 00:27:44,746
A very advanced work of art:
Fritjof and Ingeborg.

274
00:27:44,851 --> 00:27:48,719
You can't tell which is Fritjof!

275
00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:54,088
What were Sara and Sigfrid doing
in the wild strawberry patch?

276
00:27:54,193 --> 00:27:57,060
We saw you! We saw you!

277
00:27:57,163 --> 00:27:59,826
The twins ought to be muzzled.

278
00:27:59,932 --> 00:28:02,026
The twins will be quiet
or leave the table.

279
00:28:02,134 --> 00:28:03,659
No freedom of speech, eh?

280
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:05,670
Shut up, you brats.

281
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:09,832
Sara's blushing! Sara's blushing!

282
00:28:10,876 --> 00:28:13,903
Sigfrid is blushing too!
Sigfrid and Sara! Sigfrid and Sara!

283
00:28:14,013 --> 00:28:15,878
Quiet, everybody!

284
00:28:19,353 --> 00:28:20,843
But Sara!

285
00:28:20,953 --> 00:28:22,922
They're lying! They're lying!

286
00:28:48,648 --> 00:28:54,609
Isak is so fine and good,

287
00:28:55,821 --> 00:29:00,019
so moral and sensitive.

288
00:29:00,126 --> 00:29:03,255
He wants us to read poetry

289
00:29:03,797 --> 00:29:06,095
and talk about the next life

290
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:09,759
and play four-handed piano.

291
00:29:11,471 --> 00:29:14,872
And he only wants to kiss
in the dark,

292
00:29:16,108 --> 00:29:18,770
and he talks about sin.

293
00:29:18,878 --> 00:29:21,540
He's on such a terribly high level,

294
00:29:22,883 --> 00:29:25,374
and I feel so worthless.

295
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,616
And I <i>am</i> worthless...
there's no denying it.

296
00:29:34,126 --> 00:29:37,756
But sometimes it seems to me
that I'm a lot older than Isak,

297
00:29:37,864 --> 00:29:40,127
if you know what I mean.

298
00:29:40,232 --> 00:29:44,795
And then I think he's a child,
although we're the same age.

299
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:51,307
And Sigfrid is so bold and exciting,
and I want to go home.

300
00:29:51,411 --> 00:29:53,571
I don't want to be here all summer

301
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,204
and be an object of ridicule
for the twins and all of you.

302
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:58,307
I don't want to!

303
00:29:58,417 --> 00:30:00,647
I'll speak to Sigfrid.

304
00:30:00,753 --> 00:30:02,221
If he doesn't behave,

305
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:04,756
I'll make sure he's made to study
during the summer holidays.

306
00:30:04,857 --> 00:30:06,519
Papa will fix that
as easy as anything.

307
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:09,560
He too thinks Sigfrid is a
good-for-nothing and needs to work.

308
00:30:09,663 --> 00:30:13,154
Poor little Isak
who's so good to me.

309
00:30:14,468 --> 00:30:17,028
How unfair everything is.

310
00:30:18,672 --> 00:30:20,833
All will be well, you'll see.

311
00:30:20,941 --> 00:30:24,000
Listen, now they're singing
for Uncle Aron.

312
00:30:25,311 --> 00:30:30,614
How silly to write a song
for a deaf old man.

313
00:30:30,717 --> 00:30:32,344
How typical of the twins.

314
00:30:32,451 --> 00:30:37,355
<i>Flowers nod, grasses bow</i>

315
00:30:37,457 --> 00:30:42,917
<i>Around our lovely house</i>

316
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:48,592
<i>We our Uncle Aron celebrate</i>

317
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:50,670
<i>And with our song</i>

318
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:55,140
<i>Ornament his brow</i>

319
00:30:55,842 --> 00:30:59,538
Four cheers for Uncle Aron.

320
00:30:59,645 --> 00:31:03,741
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!

321
00:31:11,023 --> 00:31:13,355
I'll run down and meet
Isak and Uncle.

322
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,950
You do that.

323
00:31:15,862 --> 00:31:21,391
<i>I was overwhelmed by feelings</i>
<i>of emptiness and sadness,</i>

324
00:31:21,768 --> 00:31:25,464
<i>but was soon awakened</i>
<i>from my reveries</i>

325
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:30,007
<i>by the voice of a young girl</i>
<i>asking me repeatedly about something.</i>

326
00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:31,941
Is this your house?

327
00:31:32,045 --> 00:31:34,137
No, it's not.

328
00:31:34,247 --> 00:31:36,578
You're lucky to be telling the truth.

329
00:31:36,682 --> 00:31:39,516
It's my dad who owns the whole
headland, including the house.

330
00:31:39,618 --> 00:31:43,520
I lived here once.
Two hundred years ago.

331
00:31:43,623 --> 00:31:45,921
Oh, yeah?

332
00:31:46,326 --> 00:31:49,557
- Is that your car up at the gate?
- Yes, that's my car.

333
00:31:49,663 --> 00:31:50,788
Looks antique.

334
00:31:50,896 --> 00:31:53,730
Yes, it's antique, like its owner.

335
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,869
So you have self-irony too.
That's fantastic.

336
00:31:58,971 --> 00:32:00,997
Where are you going?
I mean, in which direction?

337
00:32:01,106 --> 00:32:02,938
Well, I'm going to Lund.

338
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:05,671
But that suits me perfectly.
You see, I'm on my way to Italy.

339
00:32:05,778 --> 00:32:08,509
I'm honored.

340
00:32:08,615 --> 00:32:10,946
My name's Sara.
Silly name, isn't it?

341
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,384
My name's Isak.
It's silly too.

342
00:32:14,488 --> 00:32:15,750
Weren't they married?

343
00:32:15,855 --> 00:32:20,691
No, unfortunately.
That was Abraham and Sara.

344
00:32:20,794 --> 00:32:21,920
Let's leave, then.

345
00:32:22,028 --> 00:32:25,862
I have another lady with me.
Here she comes.

346
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:28,833
- Marianne, this is Sara.
- Hello.

347
00:32:28,934 --> 00:32:30,903
We're going to have company
as far as Lund.

348
00:32:31,003 --> 00:32:34,962
Sara's off to Italy, but she's promised
to ride a ways with us.

349
00:32:35,075 --> 00:32:38,238
Ironic again, but it suits you.

350
00:32:39,045 --> 00:32:40,535
Let's be off.

351
00:32:45,384 --> 00:32:48,548
Hey, guys, I've got a lift
almost to Italy.

352
00:32:48,654 --> 00:32:54,615
That's Anders and that's Viktor
and this is Father Isak.

353
00:32:57,029 --> 00:33:00,431
That peach you're gaping at
is Marianne.

354
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:05,696
What a big bus.

355
00:33:05,805 --> 00:33:07,739
Yes, there's room for us all.

356
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,971
Put your luggage in the trunk,
if you don't mind.

357
00:33:27,394 --> 00:33:31,329
I must tell you, Isak,
that Anders and I are going steady.

358
00:33:31,431 --> 00:33:33,193
We're crazy about each other.

359
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,566
Viktor's the chaperone.
Daddy insisted.

360
00:33:37,903 --> 00:33:42,864
Viktor is in love with me too.

361
00:33:42,976 --> 00:33:45,843
It's a brilliant move of Daddy's.

362
00:33:45,945 --> 00:33:49,403
I may have to seduce Viktor
to get rid of him.

363
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:54,950
I'd better tell you I'm a virgin.
That's why I'm so cheeky.

364
00:33:55,055 --> 00:33:57,079
And I smoke a pipe.

365
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:02,287
Viktor says it's good for you.
He's crazy about anything healthy.

366
00:34:04,196 --> 00:34:07,132
I was once in love
with a woman called Sara.

367
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,632
No! She was like me, wasn't she?

368
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:12,637
She was, actually.

369
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:14,297
What happened to her?

370
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:18,775
She married my brother Sigfrid
and had six children.

371
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:22,813
She's 75 now
and quite a beautiful old lady.

372
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:25,543
I can't think of anything worse
than growing old.

373
00:34:26,952 --> 00:34:31,184
Oh, dear,
now I <i>have</i> put my foot in it.

374
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:16,034
Are you all right?

375
00:35:16,135 --> 00:35:19,161
I have no excuse.
It's all our fault.

376
00:35:19,271 --> 00:35:25,233
My wife was driving.
Are you all right?

377
00:35:26,012 --> 00:35:31,507
The murderers must introduce
themselves! My name's Alman.

378
00:35:32,152 --> 00:35:35,086
That's my wife Berit.
You can see she has been an actress.

379
00:35:35,188 --> 00:35:38,054
That's the complication
we were discussing when...

380
00:35:38,157 --> 00:35:40,318
Come here, Berit,
and say you're sorry.

381
00:35:40,427 --> 00:35:44,090
I'm so sorry.
It was all my fault.

382
00:35:44,197 --> 00:35:48,530
I was just going to hit my husband
when that curve appeared.

383
00:35:48,635 --> 00:35:53,800
God punishes some people at once,
eh, you Catholic?

384
00:35:53,907 --> 00:35:56,898
Let's get your car upright.

385
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:59,773
- Oh, never mind us. Please.
- Shut up, Sten.

386
00:35:59,878 --> 00:36:04,338
Some people are unselfish,
though <i>you</i> don't think so.

387
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,186
My wife is a little nervous.
We've had a shock.

388
00:36:13,025 --> 00:36:17,860
Just look at him measuring
his strength with the youngsters,

389
00:36:17,963 --> 00:36:23,731
straining his flabby muscles
to show off in front of that cute girl.

390
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:32,775
Darling, you might have a stroke.

391
00:36:35,514 --> 00:36:37,880
My wife likes ridiculing me.

392
00:36:37,983 --> 00:36:40,885
I let her.
It's psychotherapy.

393
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:49,146
I never know whether my wife
is really crying or just playacting.

394
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,157
I'll be damned if it isn't real.

395
00:37:54,994 --> 00:37:57,827
It happens when you catch
a glimpse of death.

396
00:37:57,931 --> 00:37:59,956
Can't you shut up?

397
00:38:00,065 --> 00:38:02,795
My wife can really <i>live</i> a part.

398
00:38:03,635 --> 00:38:07,128
For two years,
she made me think she had cancer

399
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:10,800
and plagued us
with every possible symptom,

400
00:38:10,909 --> 00:38:13,742
even though the doctors
could find nothing wrong with her.

401
00:38:13,847 --> 00:38:19,614
Eventually we believed her
more than the doctors!

402
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:21,914
It's natural that you're upset,

403
00:38:22,021 --> 00:38:24,454
but why not leave your wife
in peace for a while?

404
00:38:24,556 --> 00:38:26,922
A woman has a right
to her tears, eh?

405
00:38:27,025 --> 00:38:30,153
Don't get in the way
of a woman's tears.

406
00:38:31,597 --> 00:38:36,297
You are beautiful,
but old Berit's a bit past her prime.

407
00:38:36,402 --> 00:38:38,097
So you can <i>afford</i> to defend her.

408
00:38:38,204 --> 00:38:41,661
I sympathize with her.
For several reasons.

409
00:38:41,773 --> 00:38:43,900
Very sarcastic!

410
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,409
Yet you don't seem
in the least hysterical.

411
00:38:47,179 --> 00:38:50,581
But little Berit is.

412
00:38:50,949 --> 00:38:53,144
Do you know
what that means for me?

413
00:38:53,253 --> 00:38:55,050
I gather you're a Catholic.

414
00:38:55,153 --> 00:38:57,588
Quite right.
That's how I stand it.

415
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:00,021
We ridicule each other.

416
00:39:00,126 --> 00:39:02,389
She has her hysteria.
I have my Catholicism.

417
00:39:02,494 --> 00:39:05,726
So, you see,
we need each other.

418
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:08,925
It's only egoism
that we haven't killed each other.

419
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:21,237
There it came.

420
00:39:21,347 --> 00:39:24,577
That's what is called syncopes,
isn't it?

421
00:39:26,952 --> 00:39:29,251
Very funny.

422
00:39:32,724 --> 00:39:36,786
If I'd had a stopwatch,
I could have timed the explosion.

423
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:40,059
Shut up! Shut up!

424
00:39:45,637 --> 00:39:48,835
This may be too blunt,

425
00:39:49,943 --> 00:39:53,673
but for the children's sake,
will you please get out.

426
00:40:03,222 --> 00:40:06,213
Forgive us, if you can.

427
00:40:36,722 --> 00:40:40,318
<i>It was with mixed feelings</i>
<i>I saw this region again.</i>

428
00:40:40,927 --> 00:40:43,657
<i>I had my first practice here,</i>

429
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:48,393
<i>and my old mother lives nearby.</i>

430
00:40:58,744 --> 00:41:00,838
Hello there, Doctor.

431
00:41:02,248 --> 00:41:04,579
So you're in these parts again,
Doctor?

432
00:41:04,684 --> 00:41:07,777
Shall I fill it up?
Pass me the key to the hood.

433
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:13,081
Eva! Come here a moment!

434
00:41:15,161 --> 00:41:18,619
It's Dr. Borg in person.

435
00:41:19,498 --> 00:41:23,594
Mom and Dad and the whole countryside
still talk about him.

436
00:41:23,702 --> 00:41:25,932
The world's best doctor.

437
00:41:27,507 --> 00:41:31,204
Let's call the baby after him.

438
00:41:31,309 --> 00:41:34,643
Isak Akerman... not a bad name
for a prime minister.

439
00:41:34,746 --> 00:41:36,715
Suppose it's a girl.

440
00:41:36,815 --> 00:41:39,807
We only have boys.

441
00:41:46,192 --> 00:41:49,184
And how's your father these days?

442
00:41:49,295 --> 00:41:53,253
Oh, Dad's getting a bit decrepit.

443
00:41:53,365 --> 00:41:56,130
But Mom's as lively as a cricket.

444
00:41:57,302 --> 00:41:59,668
And you're going to see
<i>your</i> mother, Doctor?

445
00:42:00,806 --> 00:42:04,708
She's amazing.
She must be at least 95.

446
00:42:04,811 --> 00:42:07,302
- Ninety-six.
- Imagine that.

447
00:42:09,481 --> 00:42:11,074
What do I owe you?

448
00:42:11,184 --> 00:42:14,347
- This is on Eva and me!
- Absolutely not!

449
00:42:14,454 --> 00:42:18,322
Don't insult us, Doctor.
We can do the proper thing too!

450
00:42:18,423 --> 00:42:22,985
Why should you pay
for my gasoline?

451
00:42:23,096 --> 00:42:26,862
There are things
that <i>can't</i> be paid back...

452
00:42:26,998 --> 00:42:28,626
not even with gas.

453
00:42:28,733 --> 00:42:31,202
We haven't forgotten.

454
00:42:31,304 --> 00:42:35,070
Ask anyone around here.

455
00:42:35,173 --> 00:42:38,143
They all remember your kindness.

456
00:42:40,213 --> 00:42:43,443
Maybe I should have stayed here.

457
00:42:43,548 --> 00:42:45,141
What do you mean?

458
00:42:48,387 --> 00:42:51,150
You said you should have stayed.

459
00:42:51,257 --> 00:42:53,452
Did I?

460
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:57,050
Well, thanks anyway.

461
00:42:58,264 --> 00:43:02,893
Let me know when the new son arrives,
and I'll be the godfather.

462
00:43:03,001 --> 00:43:04,902
You know where to find me.

463
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:31,027
<i>During lunch I was in good spirits</i>

464
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:35,590
<i>and told the young people about</i>
<i>my years as district medical officer.</i>

465
00:43:35,701 --> 00:43:38,329
<i>My stories were quite a success,</i>

466
00:43:38,436 --> 00:43:41,702
<i>and I don't think they laughed</i>
<i>merely out of courtesy.</i>

467
00:43:42,275 --> 00:43:46,735
<i>I had wine with the lunch,</i>
<i>and then port with the coffee.</i>

468
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:56,514
Ah, when creation shows
so much beauty,

469
00:43:57,389 --> 00:44:00,688
how radiant must be its source!

470
00:44:00,793 --> 00:44:02,954
He is going to be a minister,
and Viktor a doctor.

471
00:44:03,061 --> 00:44:05,222
Reciting poetry
is against our agreement

472
00:44:05,331 --> 00:44:09,699
not to discuss God
or science on this trip.

473
00:44:09,802 --> 00:44:11,030
It was beautiful!

474
00:44:11,137 --> 00:44:15,539
How can anyone today
study to become a minister!

475
00:44:15,641 --> 00:44:20,043
Your rationalism is as dry as dust.

476
00:44:20,146 --> 00:44:21,875
I say that modern man...

477
00:44:21,981 --> 00:44:23,744
I say that...

478
00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:29,014
believes only in himself

479
00:44:29,121 --> 00:44:30,748
and his biological death.

480
00:44:30,856 --> 00:44:33,619
Modern man is a figment
of your imagination.

481
00:44:33,726 --> 00:44:37,320
Man regards death with horror.

482
00:44:37,429 --> 00:44:41,695
Religion for the people.
Opium for the aching limb.

483
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,358
How sweet they <i>both</i> are!

484
00:44:43,469 --> 00:44:45,494
I always agree with the one
I spoke with last.

485
00:44:45,605 --> 00:44:48,505
Once you believed in Santa Claus...
now in God.

486
00:44:48,608 --> 00:44:52,065
You never had any imagination!

487
00:44:52,177 --> 00:44:54,668
What do you say, Professor?

488
00:44:54,780 --> 00:45:00,581
Whatever I said
would be met with tolerant irony,

489
00:45:00,686 --> 00:45:02,210
so I'll say nothing.

490
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,221
I'm sure they'll be disappointed.

491
00:45:04,322 --> 00:45:08,019
No, Sara. Very, very happy.

492
00:45:10,096 --> 00:45:13,588
"Where is the friend I seek

493
00:45:13,699 --> 00:45:19,398
at break of day?

494
00:45:19,505 --> 00:45:23,463
When night falls, when..."

495
00:45:23,576 --> 00:45:26,875
"When night falls,
I still have not found Him."

496
00:45:26,978 --> 00:45:30,744
"My burning heart
shows me His traces..."

497
00:45:30,849 --> 00:45:32,784
Are you religious, Professor?

498
00:45:34,987 --> 00:45:39,083
"I see His traces

499
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:43,958
wherever flowers bloom.

500
00:45:49,101 --> 00:45:54,367
His love is mingled with every air."

501
00:45:55,307 --> 00:45:58,277
"His voice calls
in the summer wind."

502
00:45:58,376 --> 00:46:01,471
Not bad for a love poem.

503
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:06,646
I've gone all solemn again
for no reason.

504
00:46:07,887 --> 00:46:13,018
Well, I'm going to call on my mother.
I'll be back soon.

505
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:15,820
- May I come?
- Of course.

506
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:29,905
Here comes the thunder.

507
00:46:36,449 --> 00:46:40,885
I have just sent you a telegram

508
00:46:40,985 --> 00:46:44,045
on your great day.

509
00:46:44,322 --> 00:46:45,847
And now you're here.

510
00:46:45,958 --> 00:46:49,449
We all have our bright moments,
dear Mother.

511
00:46:51,963 --> 00:46:54,728
Is that your wife over there?

512
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:57,893
I don't want to talk to her.

513
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,971
She has done us too much harm.

514
00:47:01,072 --> 00:47:03,802
No, Mother dear.

515
00:47:03,909 --> 00:47:08,505
This is Evald's wife, Marianne.

516
00:47:08,614 --> 00:47:11,639
Well, let her come
and say hello to me.

517
00:47:13,952 --> 00:47:15,887
Good day, Mrs. Borg.

518
00:47:16,188 --> 00:47:19,521
And why are you
gadding about like this?

519
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:21,615
I have been in Stockholm for a visit.

520
00:47:21,726 --> 00:47:25,856
Why aren't you with Evald
and the child?

521
00:47:25,965 --> 00:47:28,865
Evald and I have no children.

522
00:47:28,967 --> 00:47:34,065
These young people nowadays!
I bore ten children.

523
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:41,509
Will you please hand me
that big box over there.

524
00:47:43,548 --> 00:47:46,449
My mother lived in this house.

525
00:47:46,552 --> 00:47:50,181
Do you remember
coming to see her, Isak?

526
00:47:50,289 --> 00:47:52,153
Very well.

527
00:47:52,257 --> 00:47:56,284
Here are some of your toys.

528
00:47:56,394 --> 00:48:01,297
I have been trying to think
which of you owned what.

529
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,130
Ten children,
and all dead except Isak.

530
00:48:05,237 --> 00:48:07,364
Twenty grandchildren.

531
00:48:07,472 --> 00:48:10,407
Evald's the only one
who comes to see me.

532
00:48:10,509 --> 00:48:13,239
Don't get me wrong...
I'm not complaining.

533
00:48:14,112 --> 00:48:17,344
Fifteen great-grandchildren
whom I have never seen.

534
00:48:17,449 --> 00:48:23,184
I send presents
for all their birthdays.

535
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:29,125
I get letters of thanks,
but nobody bothers to visit me

536
00:48:29,228 --> 00:48:32,755
unless they want to borrow money.

537
00:48:32,864 --> 00:48:36,027
Oh, I know I'm tiresome.

538
00:48:36,135 --> 00:48:38,659
Don't think that, Mother.

539
00:48:38,771 --> 00:48:40,898
And I've one more fault.

540
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,407
I don't die.

541
00:48:43,509 --> 00:48:47,137
The inheritance
isn't being divided up

542
00:48:47,246 --> 00:48:50,271
the way these crafty young people
had planned.

543
00:48:51,449 --> 00:48:54,851
This was Sigbritt's doll.

544
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,179
She got it when she turned eight.

545
00:48:58,356 --> 00:49:01,018
I made the dress myself.

546
00:49:01,126 --> 00:49:03,492
But she never cared for it

547
00:49:03,596 --> 00:49:05,530
so it went to Charlotta.

548
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:09,192
She took care of it...
I remember it clearly.

549
00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:12,733
Do you see who that is?

550
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:16,137
Sigfrid was three
and you were five.

551
00:49:16,842 --> 00:49:20,277
And myself.

552
00:49:20,378 --> 00:49:22,813
What a fright
one looked in those days.

553
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:25,315
May I have it?

554
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:27,942
By all means.
It's only rubbish.

555
00:49:28,954 --> 00:49:30,784
And here's a coloring book.

556
00:49:30,889 --> 00:49:36,521
I don't know whose it was.

557
00:49:36,628 --> 00:49:39,188
They've all put their names in it.

558
00:49:40,266 --> 00:49:42,233
Kristina has scrawled:

559
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:47,293
"I love Papa more than
anything in the whole world."

560
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:53,568
And Birgitta has put:
"I'm going to marry Papa."

561
00:49:54,579 --> 00:49:58,983
Isn't that funny?
I laughed when I saw it.

562
00:50:00,018 --> 00:50:04,148
Don't you think it's cold in here?

563
00:50:04,255 --> 00:50:06,884
No, not particularly.

564
00:50:06,992 --> 00:50:10,655
I have felt cold all my life.

565
00:50:10,762 --> 00:50:14,221
Mostly my stomach.
I wonder why.

566
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:17,166
You have low blood pressure.

567
00:50:17,268 --> 00:50:22,137
Let us have some tea,
and we can sit and talk.

568
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,403
No, thank you, Mother.
We won't disturb you any longer.

569
00:50:29,614 --> 00:50:32,583
Sigbritt's eldest boy
will soon be 50.

570
00:50:32,684 --> 00:50:35,778
I thought of giving him
Father's gold watch.

571
00:50:35,887 --> 00:50:39,789
It has no hands.
Does that matter?

572
00:50:49,735 --> 00:50:54,034
I remember when Sigbritt's boy
was a newborn.

573
00:50:54,139 --> 00:50:59,543
He used to lie in the lilac arbor
at the summer house.

574
00:50:59,644 --> 00:51:02,704
Now he's turning 50.

575
00:51:03,815 --> 00:51:09,311
And little cousin Sara used to
carry him around and sing to him.

576
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,184
She married Sigfrid,
that good-for-nothing.

577
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:18,619
Well, you must go now,
or you'll be late for the ceremony.

578
00:51:18,731 --> 00:51:23,793
I am very glad you came,
and I hope to see you again.

579
00:51:23,902 --> 00:51:27,393
Give my love to Evald.
Good-bye.

580
00:51:54,099 --> 00:51:56,498
Where are Anders and Viktor?

581
00:51:56,601 --> 00:52:02,233
They started arguing about God,
and then they lost their tempers.

582
00:52:02,675 --> 00:52:05,802
And Anders tried
to twist Viktor's arm,

583
00:52:05,911 --> 00:52:09,847
and Viktor said that was
a lousy argument for God's existence.

584
00:52:09,947 --> 00:52:13,577
I said they could talk
about me instead.

585
00:52:13,686 --> 00:52:18,385
Then they told me to shut up
because I didn't understand the debate,

586
00:52:18,489 --> 00:52:19,956
so I left.

587
00:52:20,059 --> 00:52:24,188
They went up the hill to fight it out
because each insisted...

588
00:52:24,295 --> 00:52:27,231
the other had hurt
his innermost feelings.

589
00:52:27,331 --> 00:52:29,561
- Where are they now?
- Up there.

590
00:52:33,672 --> 00:52:35,298
I'll see to them.

591
00:52:35,407 --> 00:52:37,840
Which one do <i>you</i> like best?

592
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:40,440
Which one do you like best?

593
00:52:40,545 --> 00:52:43,913
I don't know.
Anders is going to be a minister...

594
00:52:44,016 --> 00:52:46,041
He's a darling.

595
00:52:46,985 --> 00:52:49,010
But a minister's wife...

596
00:52:49,121 --> 00:52:52,090
Viktor's nice too.
In a different way.

597
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:55,626
- Viktor will go far, of course.
- What do you mean?

598
00:52:55,728 --> 00:53:00,960
A doctor earns more money.
And ministers are out of date.

599
00:53:01,065 --> 00:53:04,762
Though he has got nice legs
and a sweet neck.

600
00:53:06,003 --> 00:53:07,938
But how <i>can</i> anyone believe in God?

601
00:53:21,586 --> 00:53:24,181
Well? Does God exist?

602
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:53,318
<i>I dozed off,</i>
<i>but was haunted by vivid</i>

603
00:53:53,418 --> 00:53:59,014
<i>and humiliating dreams.</i>

604
00:53:59,958 --> 00:54:06,295
<i>There was something overpowering</i>
<i>in these dream images</i>

605
00:54:06,398 --> 00:54:12,336
<i>that bored relentlessly into my mind.</i>

606
00:54:23,047 --> 00:54:25,039
Have you looked in the mirror, Isak?

607
00:54:28,186 --> 00:54:30,177
Then I'll show you
what you look like.

608
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:35,489
You're a worried old man
who's soon going to die,

609
00:54:35,594 --> 00:54:38,289
but I have all my life before me.

610
00:54:39,864 --> 00:54:42,298
That hurt your feelings, after all.

611
00:54:43,235 --> 00:54:46,500
No, it didn't hurt.

612
00:54:46,605 --> 00:54:51,702
Yes, it hurt
because you can't bear the truth.

613
00:54:52,744 --> 00:54:56,271
The truth is that
I've been too considerate.

614
00:54:56,882 --> 00:54:59,043
And so became unintentionally cruel.

615
00:55:02,186 --> 00:55:03,278
I understand.

616
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:08,324
No, you don't understand.
We don't speak the same language.

617
00:55:09,561 --> 00:55:11,289
Look in the mirror again.

618
00:55:11,396 --> 00:55:13,420
No, don't turn away.

619
00:55:14,032 --> 00:55:15,590
I see.

620
00:55:16,201 --> 00:55:17,862
Listen to me.

621
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:22,302
I'm going to marry
your brother Sigfrid.

622
00:55:23,141 --> 00:55:27,271
Love is almost a game for us.

623
00:55:28,981 --> 00:55:33,418
Look at your face now.
Try to smile!

624
00:55:35,086 --> 00:55:37,681
There! Now you're smiling.

625
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:41,815
But it hurts so.

626
00:55:42,327 --> 00:55:47,264
As professor emeritus,
you ought to know why it hurts.

627
00:55:47,365 --> 00:55:48,923
But you don't know.

628
00:55:50,068 --> 00:55:54,003
You know so much,
and you don't know anything.

629
00:55:55,974 --> 00:55:57,601
I must go.

630
00:55:57,708 --> 00:56:01,235
I promised to keep an eye
on Sigbritt's baby.

631
00:56:29,974 --> 00:56:32,204
Poor little thing.

632
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:35,675
Hush, baby. Sleep.

633
00:56:36,949 --> 00:56:38,746
Don't be afraid of the wind

634
00:56:39,818 --> 00:56:44,652
or the birds

635
00:56:45,523 --> 00:56:48,458
or the waves of the sea.

636
00:56:49,161 --> 00:56:52,494
I'm here with you,
holding you tight.

637
00:56:52,597 --> 00:56:55,121
Don't be afraid, little one.

638
00:56:56,501 --> 00:56:58,661
It will soon be day again.

639
00:56:59,704 --> 00:57:01,672
No one will hurt you.

640
00:57:01,773 --> 00:57:04,936
I am with you.
I am holding you.

641
01:00:12,998 --> 01:00:15,090
Please come in, Professor Borg.

642
01:01:33,411 --> 01:01:35,436
Have you brought
your examination book?

643
01:01:42,954 --> 01:01:46,583
Please identify the bacterial specimen
under the microscope.

644
01:01:58,036 --> 01:02:00,094
There must be something wrong.

645
01:02:04,342 --> 01:02:05,831
Not with the microscope.

646
01:02:05,943 --> 01:02:09,242
I can't see a thing.

647
01:02:10,282 --> 01:02:13,012
Please read this text.

648
01:02:27,931 --> 01:02:29,364
What does it mean?

649
01:02:31,101 --> 01:02:32,864
I don't know.

650
01:02:34,505 --> 01:02:35,597
Really?

651
01:02:35,706 --> 01:02:39,507
I'm a doctor, not a linguist.

652
01:02:40,577 --> 01:02:46,311
What you see on the blackboard
is a doctor's first duty.

653
01:02:47,452 --> 01:02:50,353
Don't you know what that is?

654
01:02:53,157 --> 01:02:54,954
Let me think.

655
01:02:55,059 --> 01:02:56,686
Take your time.

656
01:02:58,697 --> 01:03:02,827
A doctor's first duty...

657
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,030
A doctor's...

658
01:03:06,704 --> 01:03:08,137
I've forgotten.

659
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:12,471
A doctor's first duty
is to ask for forgiveness.

660
01:03:13,177 --> 01:03:17,581
Of course! Now I remember!

661
01:03:29,293 --> 01:03:31,956
You have been accused of guilt.

662
01:03:35,132 --> 01:03:38,398
I'll make a note that you haven't
understood the charge.

663
01:03:41,572 --> 01:03:43,541
Is it serious?

664
01:03:44,275 --> 01:03:45,936
Unfortunately, Professor.

665
01:03:57,956 --> 01:03:59,617
I have a weak heart.

666
01:03:59,724 --> 01:04:01,987
I'm an old man.

667
01:04:02,092 --> 01:04:04,925
You must be lenient with me.
It's only fair.

668
01:04:05,362 --> 01:04:08,092
There's nothing about your heart
in my papers.

669
01:04:08,699 --> 01:04:10,099
Do you want to stop the examination?

670
01:04:10,201 --> 01:04:12,226
No, for God's sake, no!

671
01:04:19,744 --> 01:04:22,974
Please diagnose the patient.

672
01:04:36,827 --> 01:04:39,456
The patient is dead.

673
01:05:01,719 --> 01:05:03,914
What are you writing in my book?

674
01:05:04,021 --> 01:05:07,081
- My verdict.
- And that is?

675
01:05:07,525 --> 01:05:09,458
That you are incompetent.

676
01:05:12,864 --> 01:05:18,199
You are also accused of some minor
but still serious offenses.

677
01:05:18,836 --> 01:05:23,273
Callousness, selfishness,
ruthlessness.

678
01:05:24,108 --> 01:05:27,077
Your wife has made the charge.

679
01:05:27,177 --> 01:05:29,510
You'll be confronted with her.

680
01:05:29,614 --> 01:05:32,105
But my wife has been dead for years!

681
01:05:32,217 --> 01:05:34,081
Do you think I'm joking?

682
01:05:36,653 --> 01:05:38,815
Please come with me.

683
01:05:39,324 --> 01:05:41,416
You have no choice.

684
01:08:02,032 --> 01:08:05,025
Many forget a woman
who has been dead for 30 years.

685
01:08:05,702 --> 01:08:08,797
Some cherish
a sweet and fading picture,

686
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:14,905
but you can recall this scene
at any time.

687
01:08:15,746 --> 01:08:18,443
Tuesday, May 1 st, 1917.

688
01:08:19,717 --> 01:08:21,377
You stood on this very spot.

689
01:08:21,485 --> 01:08:25,922
And heard and saw what that man
and woman said and did.

690
01:08:40,938 --> 01:08:45,375
Now I'll go home and tell Isak.
I know just what he'll say.

691
01:08:45,475 --> 01:08:48,809
"My poor girl, I'm sorry for you."

692
01:08:50,681 --> 01:08:53,047
Just as if he were God.

693
01:08:54,685 --> 01:08:59,918
Then I'll weep and say,
"Do you really feel sorry for me?"

694
01:09:01,158 --> 01:09:05,595
He'll say, "Yes, very sorry."

695
01:09:06,197 --> 01:09:10,224
Then I'll weep even more
and ask him to forgive me.

696
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:11,528
He'll say,

697
01:09:11,636 --> 01:09:16,938
"You mustn't beg my forgiveness.
There is nothing to forgive."

698
01:09:19,711 --> 01:09:22,440
But he doesn't mean
a word he says

699
01:09:24,414 --> 01:09:26,679
because he's cold as ice.

700
01:09:28,586 --> 01:09:31,282
And suddenly he gets very tender,

701
01:09:32,823 --> 01:09:35,314
and I scream at him that he's mad

702
01:09:37,095 --> 01:09:40,359
and that his hypocrisy makes me sick.

703
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:44,425
Then he says
he'll get me a sedative

704
01:09:44,534 --> 01:09:47,731
and that he understands
everything quite well.

705
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:51,100
And I tell him it's his fault
that I am as I am.

706
01:09:53,543 --> 01:09:57,673
And he looks sad
and says it <i>is</i> his fault.

707
01:09:59,583 --> 01:10:01,881
But he doesn't really care
about anything

708
01:10:02,552 --> 01:10:04,520
because he's so cold.

709
01:10:28,512 --> 01:10:29,979
Where is she?

710
01:10:30,081 --> 01:10:34,541
Gone. All are gone.

711
01:10:34,652 --> 01:10:38,587
Removed by an operation,
Professor.

712
01:10:39,222 --> 01:10:42,851
A surgical masterpiece.
No pain.

713
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,894
Nothing that bleeds or trembles.

714
01:10:45,796 --> 01:10:47,957
How silent it is.

715
01:10:48,966 --> 01:10:51,457
A perfect achievement
in its way, Professor.

716
01:10:52,502 --> 01:10:54,300
And the punishment?

717
01:10:54,404 --> 01:10:58,068
I don't know.
The usual, I suppose.

718
01:10:58,176 --> 01:10:59,734
The usual?

719
01:10:59,844 --> 01:11:01,743
Loneliness.

720
01:11:01,845 --> 01:11:04,144
Loneliness?

721
01:11:04,247 --> 01:11:07,081
Precisely.

722
01:11:07,819 --> 01:11:09,912
Is there no mercy?

723
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:13,387
Don't ask me. I don't know.

724
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:35,340
What's this?

725
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:39,046
The children wanted
to stretch their legs.

726
01:11:39,149 --> 01:11:41,845
But it's still raining.

727
01:11:41,953 --> 01:11:46,617
I told them about today
and they want to honor you.

728
01:11:48,091 --> 01:11:49,115
Slept well?

729
01:11:49,226 --> 01:11:54,994
Yes, but recently I've had
the weirdest dreams,

730
01:11:59,837 --> 01:12:04,171
as if I must tell myself something
I won't listen to when I'm awake.

731
01:12:04,274 --> 01:12:05,605
What's that?

732
01:12:06,978 --> 01:12:10,105
That I'm dead.
Although I'm alive.

733
01:12:10,981 --> 01:12:13,472
You and Evald are very alike.

734
01:12:14,351 --> 01:12:16,012
So you've said.

735
01:12:16,119 --> 01:12:18,350
He said the same thing.

736
01:12:18,788 --> 01:12:20,814
About me?

737
01:12:20,925 --> 01:12:22,654
No. About himself.

738
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,226
But he's only 38.

739
01:12:26,831 --> 01:12:29,322
May I tell you about it?

740
01:12:29,432 --> 01:12:33,368
Yes, I'd be grateful.

741
01:12:34,939 --> 01:12:39,307
A few months ago
I wanted to talk to Evald,

742
01:12:39,409 --> 01:12:41,502
so he drove me down to the sea.

743
01:12:41,612 --> 01:12:45,672
It was raining then too.
He sat where you sit now.

744
01:12:47,952 --> 01:12:52,320
Well, you've trapped me.
What do you want to say?

745
01:12:52,422 --> 01:12:54,653
Something unpleasant, of course.

746
01:12:56,027 --> 01:12:58,086
I wish I didn't have to.

747
01:12:58,194 --> 01:13:00,253
You have found someone else.

748
01:13:01,164 --> 01:13:02,996
Don't be childish.

749
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:07,695
You tell me in funereal tones
that you must talk to me,

750
01:13:07,805 --> 01:13:11,536
and then you find it
hard to begin.

751
01:13:11,641 --> 01:13:17,581
Come on, for heaven's sake!
Don't keep me on tenterhooks!

752
01:13:17,681 --> 01:13:19,512
I almost want to laugh now.

753
01:13:19,617 --> 01:13:21,516
Whatever do you think
I'm going to tell you?

754
01:13:21,618 --> 01:13:25,817
That I've killed someone,
or stolen the faculty funds?

755
01:13:25,922 --> 01:13:27,550
I'm going to have a baby.

756
01:13:30,427 --> 01:13:31,952
Are you sure?

757
01:13:32,063 --> 01:13:34,462
The doctor told me yesterday.

758
01:13:34,564 --> 01:13:38,934
So that was the secret.

759
01:13:39,936 --> 01:13:44,237
I might as well tell you
that I intend to have this child.

760
01:13:45,443 --> 01:13:48,070
- You've made up your mind?
- Yes, I have.

761
01:14:04,561 --> 01:14:06,621
You know I don't want a child.

762
01:14:06,730 --> 01:14:09,164
You'll have to choose
between me and the child.

763
01:14:09,265 --> 01:14:12,326
- Poor Evald.
- Don't "poor Evald" me!

764
01:14:13,136 --> 01:14:16,628
It's absurd to bring children
into this world

765
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:19,608
and think they'll be better off
than we are.

766
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:23,578
- That's just an excuse.
- Call it what you want.

767
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:27,980
I was an unwanted child
in a hellish marriage.

768
01:14:28,085 --> 01:14:30,952
Is he even sure I'm his son?

769
01:14:31,055 --> 01:14:34,717
That's no excuse
for behaving like this.

770
01:14:34,824 --> 01:14:36,349
I must be at the hospital at 3:00.

771
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:39,429
I have neither the time nor the desire
to discuss this any further.

772
01:14:41,498 --> 01:14:43,399
You're a coward.

773
01:14:43,967 --> 01:14:45,435
Yes.

774
01:14:45,802 --> 01:14:47,930
This life sickens me.

775
01:14:48,038 --> 01:14:49,699
I will not be forced to take on

776
01:14:49,806 --> 01:14:52,640
a responsibility that will make me live
for one day longer than I want to.

777
01:14:52,743 --> 01:14:57,612
And you know
that I mean what I say.

778
01:15:10,027 --> 01:15:11,858
I know that this is wrong.

779
01:15:11,962 --> 01:15:14,293
There's neither right nor wrong.

780
01:15:14,398 --> 01:15:18,528
We act according to our needs.

781
01:15:18,636 --> 01:15:19,898
And what are they?

782
01:15:20,637 --> 01:15:25,131
Yours is a hellish desire
to live and to create life.

783
01:15:25,242 --> 01:15:26,368
And yours?

784
01:15:27,511 --> 01:15:31,503
Mine is to be dead.
Stone-dead.

785
01:15:44,395 --> 01:15:48,161
If you want to smoke a cigarette,
I don't mind.

786
01:15:52,502 --> 01:15:55,301
Why have you told me all this?

787
01:15:57,774 --> 01:16:03,713
I saw you with your mother,
and I was panic-stricken.

788
01:16:05,216 --> 01:16:06,877
I don't understand.

789
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:13,753
I thought: That's his mother.

790
01:16:14,557 --> 01:16:19,621
An old woman, cold as ice,

791
01:16:19,729 --> 01:16:22,756
more forbidding than death.

792
01:16:24,033 --> 01:16:26,264
And this is her son,

793
01:16:26,804 --> 01:16:30,001
and there are light-years
between them.

794
01:16:31,007 --> 01:16:33,670
He himself says
he's a living corpse.

795
01:16:35,779 --> 01:16:41,182
And Evald is growing
just as lonely, cold and dead.

796
01:16:42,886 --> 01:16:45,855
And I thought of the baby inside me.

797
01:16:46,856 --> 01:16:51,122
All along the line,
there's nothing but cold and death

798
01:16:51,228 --> 01:16:54,197
and loneliness.

799
01:16:55,099 --> 01:16:57,430
It must end somewhere.

800
01:16:58,601 --> 01:17:01,127
But you're going back to Evald!

801
01:17:02,907 --> 01:17:05,966
To say I can't agree
to his conditions.

802
01:17:06,076 --> 01:17:10,069
I want this child.
No one can take it from me.

803
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:12,614
Not even the man
I love most of all.

804
01:17:16,086 --> 01:17:18,110
Can I help you?

805
01:17:18,221 --> 01:17:19,689
No one can help me.

806
01:17:21,292 --> 01:17:24,351
We are too old.
Things have gone too far.

807
01:17:25,296 --> 01:17:28,128
What happened after your talk?

808
01:17:28,231 --> 01:17:30,699
Nothing.
I left him the next day.

809
01:17:31,234 --> 01:17:33,328
Hasn't he gotten in touch with you?

810
01:17:35,271 --> 01:17:40,005
- I don't want us to get...
- To get what?

811
01:17:41,779 --> 01:17:44,372
Like those two in the car today.

812
01:17:46,149 --> 01:17:48,778
I was just thinking of them.

813
01:17:49,319 --> 01:17:52,811
It reminded me of my own marriage.

814
01:17:53,556 --> 01:17:55,387
But we love each other.

815
01:17:55,492 --> 01:17:57,960
<i>Long may he live</i>
<i>Long may he live</i>

816
01:17:58,061 --> 01:18:00,895
<i>May he live to be</i>
<i>a hundred years old</i>

817
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:06,100
We heard you're celebrating
a grand occasion today.

818
01:18:06,203 --> 01:18:10,400
With these simple flowers
we want to say

819
01:18:10,506 --> 01:18:15,069
that we are <i>very</i> impressed
that you've been a doctor for 50 years.

820
01:18:15,179 --> 01:18:18,979
We know you must be
a very wise old man

821
01:18:19,783 --> 01:18:22,479
who knows <i>everything</i> about life

822
01:18:22,586 --> 01:18:27,023
and has learned
all the instructions by heart.

823
01:18:29,326 --> 01:18:31,760
Thank you.

824
01:18:33,029 --> 01:18:36,193
Now we must go on.
It's getting late.

825
01:19:05,296 --> 01:19:09,756
So you did come.
Evald and I had given up hope.

826
01:19:10,033 --> 01:19:12,797
A nice drive is relaxing, isn't it?

827
01:19:13,636 --> 01:19:16,605
You'll have to get
into your tails at once.

828
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:21,270
Good afternoon, Marianne.
I've told Evald you're coming.

829
01:19:21,377 --> 01:19:23,845
Thank you.
That was most kind.

830
01:19:24,881 --> 01:19:26,747
So you came after all, Miss Agda.

831
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:31,947
I considered it my duty.
But my pleasure's been spoiled.

832
01:19:33,256 --> 01:19:34,814
Welcome, Father.

833
01:19:36,092 --> 01:19:38,118
As you see,
I've brought Marianne with me.

834
01:19:38,228 --> 01:19:40,957
- Hello, Marianne.
- May I put my things upstairs?

835
01:19:41,064 --> 01:19:44,056
The guest room as usual, Father?

836
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:46,533
Let me take your bag.
It's rather heavy.

837
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:53,307
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, it was pleasant.

838
01:19:53,409 --> 01:19:54,637
Who are those young people?

839
01:19:54,744 --> 01:19:56,939
I don't know. They're nice,
and they're off to Italy.

840
01:19:57,046 --> 01:20:00,015
- They seem nice.
- Yes, they're very nice.

841
01:20:00,117 --> 01:20:02,813
It's a quarter past 4:00.

842
01:20:07,925 --> 01:20:09,916
I've bought you new shoelaces.

843
01:20:18,868 --> 01:20:21,234
I'm leaving tomorrow,
so don't worry.

844
01:20:21,337 --> 01:20:23,738
- Are you going to a hotel?
- No, why?

845
01:20:23,841 --> 01:20:27,572
Can't we share the bedroom
for one more night? Unless you object.

846
01:20:27,677 --> 01:20:30,646
- Give me a hand unpacking?
- It's nice to see you.

847
01:20:30,814 --> 01:20:32,713
And unexpected.

848
01:20:32,815 --> 01:20:34,511
Same here.

849
01:20:34,618 --> 01:20:37,451
Are we going on
to the banquet afterwards?

850
01:20:37,554 --> 01:20:42,082
Yes, I'll just call Stenberg
and tell him I'll have a lady with me.

851
01:20:49,733 --> 01:20:51,859
Hurry up, Professor!

852
01:22:26,796 --> 01:22:31,734
<i>During the ceremony,</i>

853
01:22:31,835 --> 01:22:35,770
<i>my thoughts strayed</i>
<i>to the day's events,</i>

854
01:22:36,573 --> 01:22:40,770
<i>and it was then I decided</i>

855
01:22:40,877 --> 01:22:43,676
<i>to write down what had happened.</i>

856
01:22:44,146 --> 01:22:50,051
<i>In this jumble of events,</i>

857
01:22:50,153 --> 01:22:54,350
<i>I seemed to discern</i>
<i>an extraordinary logic.</i>

858
01:23:20,016 --> 01:23:22,985
Did you enjoy the ceremony?

859
01:23:23,086 --> 01:23:24,814
Yes, thank you.

860
01:23:26,689 --> 01:23:28,213
Are you tired, Miss Agda?

861
01:23:28,324 --> 01:23:29,917
I won't deny it.

862
01:23:30,027 --> 01:23:32,051
Take one of my sleeping pills.

863
01:23:34,898 --> 01:23:39,801
Miss Agda, I am sorry
about this morning.

864
01:23:40,337 --> 01:23:42,270
Are you ill, Professor?

865
01:23:42,372 --> 01:23:44,305
No. Why?

866
01:23:44,408 --> 01:23:47,844
I don't like the sound of it.

867
01:23:48,478 --> 01:23:50,810
Is it so rare
for me to say I'm sorry?

868
01:23:53,516 --> 01:23:55,849
Do you want the carafe
on the table?

869
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:23,912
Thank you anyway, Professor.
Good night.

870
01:24:24,514 --> 01:24:26,243
Miss Agda,

871
01:24:28,251 --> 01:24:32,551
as we have known each other

872
01:24:32,655 --> 01:24:34,783
for so many years,

873
01:24:34,890 --> 01:24:38,382
don't you think we could call
each other Agda and Isak?

874
01:24:38,494 --> 01:24:41,157
No, I don't.

875
01:24:41,264 --> 01:24:42,560
Why not?

876
01:24:43,332 --> 01:24:45,163
Have you brushed your teeth,
Professor?

877
01:24:47,037 --> 01:24:51,132
No intimacies for me, thank you.

878
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:53,402
It's all right between us as it is.

879
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:56,444
But we are old now.

880
01:24:56,546 --> 01:25:01,313
Speak for yourself.
A woman is jealous of her reputation.

881
01:25:02,019 --> 01:25:06,251
What would people think if we
suddenly began to say Agda and Isak?

882
01:25:06,355 --> 01:25:08,289
They would make fun of us.

883
01:25:08,391 --> 01:25:11,792
Are you always right?

884
01:25:11,895 --> 01:25:13,953
Almost always.

885
01:25:14,064 --> 01:25:19,057
At our age,
we should know how to behave.

886
01:25:26,208 --> 01:25:30,542
Good night, Professor.
I'll leave the door ajar.

887
01:25:30,646 --> 01:25:34,673
You know where I am
if you want anything.

888
01:26:20,329 --> 01:26:23,993
Father Isak! You were splendid
in the procession.

889
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,069
We were terribly proud
to know you.

890
01:26:26,168 --> 01:26:30,127
An old girl is giving us a lift
all the way to Hamburg.

891
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:33,140
- Anders is mad about her.
- Oh, be quiet.

892
01:26:33,243 --> 01:26:35,039
We just wanted to say good-bye.

893
01:26:35,145 --> 01:26:37,578
Good-bye. And thank you
for your company.

894
01:26:39,916 --> 01:26:42,213
It's you I really love, you know.

895
01:26:42,319 --> 01:26:46,345
Today, tomorrow, always.

896
01:26:46,856 --> 01:26:48,721
I'll remember.

897
01:26:49,158 --> 01:26:51,854
Come on.

898
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:01,065
We have to go now.

899
01:27:04,673 --> 01:27:06,801
Let me hear from you.

900
01:27:18,921 --> 01:27:21,412
- I think Uncle is asleep.
- Evald!

901
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:24,521
Yes, Father?

902
01:27:24,627 --> 01:27:26,255
Are you back already?

903
01:27:27,596 --> 01:27:30,064
Marianne lost the heel on a shoe.

904
01:27:32,002 --> 01:27:34,162
So you're going to the dance?

905
01:27:35,337 --> 01:27:37,271
I suppose so.

906
01:27:38,408 --> 01:27:41,467
- How are you, Father?
- Excellent.

907
01:27:41,578 --> 01:27:44,307
- Heart all right?
- Excellent.

908
01:27:46,082 --> 01:27:48,140
Sleep well.

909
01:27:50,353 --> 01:27:53,345
Sit down a moment.

910
01:27:55,057 --> 01:27:56,957
Anything special?

911
01:27:58,261 --> 01:28:03,596
How is it to be
between you and Marianne?

912
01:28:05,068 --> 01:28:06,694
Forgive my asking.

913
01:28:06,802 --> 01:28:08,292
I don't know.

914
01:28:09,139 --> 01:28:11,903
It's not my business, but...

915
01:28:13,909 --> 01:28:16,435
But wouldn't it...

916
01:28:16,546 --> 01:28:18,570
I have asked her to stay with me.

917
01:28:18,681 --> 01:28:20,877
Shouldn't you... I mean...

918
01:28:20,984 --> 01:28:25,250
- I can't live without her.
- You mean alone?

919
01:28:25,354 --> 01:28:28,414
I can't live without <i>her.</i>
That's what I mean.

920
01:28:28,524 --> 01:28:30,493
Oh, I see.

921
01:28:30,594 --> 01:28:32,323
It will be as she wants.

922
01:28:32,761 --> 01:28:35,423
And she...

923
01:28:36,065 --> 01:28:39,229
She says she'll think about it.

924
01:28:40,136 --> 01:28:42,069
About that debt of yours...

925
01:28:42,171 --> 01:28:44,402
Don't worry,
you'll get your money.

926
01:28:44,506 --> 01:28:47,100
That's not what I meant.

927
01:28:49,578 --> 01:28:50,944
How are you, Uncle Isak?

928
01:28:51,046 --> 01:28:52,980
Fine. Just fine.

929
01:28:53,082 --> 01:28:56,074
I lost a heel.
Will these shoes do?

930
01:28:56,185 --> 01:28:58,654
They're very nice.

931
01:29:01,591 --> 01:29:03,684
Thanks for coming with me.

932
01:29:07,029 --> 01:29:09,930
I like you, Marianne.

933
01:29:10,567 --> 01:29:12,864
I like you too, Uncle Isak.

934
01:29:21,344 --> 01:29:25,507
<i>If I have been worried</i>
<i>or sad during the day,</i>

935
01:29:26,015 --> 01:29:31,578
<i>it often calms me</i>
<i>to recall childhood memories.</i>

936
01:29:32,588 --> 01:29:34,954
<i>I did so on this evening too.</i>

937
01:29:46,836 --> 01:29:50,203
Isak, there are no
wild strawberries left.

938
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:53,171
Auntie wants you
to look for your papa.

939
01:29:53,275 --> 01:29:55,971
We'll sail around and meet you
at the other side of the island.

940
01:29:56,412 --> 01:30:00,782
I can't find either Papa or Mama.

941
01:30:01,384 --> 01:30:03,978
Come, I'll help you.
