1
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,779
You wished
to speak to me, Doctor?

2
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:27,365
<i>Have you seen Mrs. Vogler yet,
Sister Alma?</i>

3
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,491
No, not yet.

4
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:30,701
<i>Let me explain her situation</i>

5
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:34,455
<i>and why you've been
hired to care for her.</i>

6
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,917
<i>Mrs. Vogler is an actress,
as you know.</i>

7
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:41,420
<i>In the middle of her last
performance of</i> Electra,

8
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:46,134
<i>she fell silent and looked
around as if in surprise.</i>

9
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,886
<i>She was silent
for over a minute.</i>

10
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:04,318
<i>She apologized
to her colleagues afterward,</i>

11
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:07,155
<i>saying she'd felt
a sudden urge to laugh.</i>

12
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:09,657
<i>The next day
the theater called</i>

13
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:12,577
<i>to ask if she'd forgotten
about rehearsal.</i>

14
00:08:12,702 --> 00:08:16,330
<i>The maid went in her room
and found her still in bed.</i>

15
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,750
<i>She was awake but wouldn't
answer questions or move.</i>

16
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,754
This condition's gone on
for three months now.

17
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,632
She's been given
every conceivable test.

18
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,843
The result is clear:

19
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:32,471
She's perfectly healthy,
both mentally and physically.

20
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:36,309
And it's not a question
of some hysterical reaction either.

21
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,895
Any questions,
Sister Alma?

22
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:43,107
If not, you can go
see Mrs. Vogler now.

23
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:53,201
Hello, Mrs. Vogler.

24
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,662
I'm Sister Alma.

25
00:08:56,787 --> 00:09:00,291
I've been hired to take care
of you for a while.

26
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,463
Perhaps I should tell you
a bit about myself.

27
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:08,216
I'm 25 years old,
and I'm engaged.

28
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:11,677
I got my nursing certificate
two years ago.

29
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,056
My parents have
a farm in the country.

30
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,435
My mother was a nurse too,
before she got married.

31
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:24,899
I should go get your dinner tray...
fried liver and fruit salad.

32
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,151
It looked quite good.

33
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:31,822
Shall I raise this end up?
Are you all right like that?

34
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:42,041
<i>Sister Alma,
what's your first impression?</i>

35
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,670
I don't know
what to say, Doctor.

36
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:49,507
At first her face looks soft,
almost childish,

37
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:51,968
but then
you see her eyes...

38
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,929
Her expression's so hard.

39
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:57,807
Perhaps I shouldn't...

40
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,101
<i>What were you going to say?</i>

41
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:02,937
I was thinking I should
turn down the assignment.

42
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:05,606
<i>Why? Did something
frighten you?</i>

43
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,858
No, not exactly,

44
00:10:07,984 --> 00:10:11,696
but perhaps Mrs. Vogler
should have an older nurse,

45
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:13,864
one with more life experience.

46
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,285
I might not be able to manage.
<i>- Manage? In what way?</i>

47
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,620
- Mentally.
<i>- Mentally?</i>

48
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:24,083
If she's made a conscious
decision not to speak or move,

49
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,627
which must be the case,
since she's healthy...

50
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,379
<i>Then?</i>

51
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:31,716
Then that shows
great mental strength.

52
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:33,843
I may not be up to it.

53
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,514
I thought you might want
to see the twilight.

54
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,683
I can draw
the curtains later.

55
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,688
Shall I turn on the radio?

56
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:48,190
I think there's a play on.

57
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:52,653
<i>Forgive me, darling.</i>

58
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:55,948
<i>You must forgive me.</i>

59
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:59,869
<i>All I want
is your forgiveness.</i>

60
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:05,499
What are you laughing about?
Is the actress so funny?

61
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:10,254
<i>What do you know
of mercy? Well?</i>

62
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:14,258
<i>What do you know
of mercy?</i>

63
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:22,141
I don't understand
those sorts of things.

64
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,102
I enjoy films
and the theater,

65
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,855
but I'm afraid
I don't go very often.

66
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:31,025
I have tremendous
admiration for artists.

67
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:35,780
I think art is enormously
important in life,

68
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:40,034
especially for those struggling
for one reason or another.

69
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:46,123
But I'm skating on thin ice,
telling <i>you</i> about such things.

70
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,793
Let's see
if I can find some music.

71
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,879
Is that all right?

72
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,967
Good night, then.
Sleep well.

73
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:50,080
Damn it.

74
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,715
It's funny.

75
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,968
You can go about
as you please...

76
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:06,055
doing almost anything
you please.

77
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:12,645
I'll marry Karl-Henrik
and we'll have a couple kids,

78
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,813
whom I'll raise.

79
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:18,859
It's all decided.
It's inside me.

80
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,238
I don't even have
to think about it.

81
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:25,616
It's a great feeling
of security.

82
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:29,912
I have a job
I like and enjoy.

83
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,915
That's good too...

84
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,751
but in another way.

85
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,379
But it's good.

86
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,381
Yes...

87
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:43,884
it's good.

88
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:54,478
I wonder what's really
wrong with her.

89
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:59,400
Elisabet Vogler.

90
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,504
Mrs. Vogler, would you like me
to open the letter?

91
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,429
Shall I read it?

92
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,437
Shall I read it to you?

93
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,739
"Dearest Elisabet,

94
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,702
since I'm not allowed
to see you, I'm writing instead.

95
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:18,664
If you don't wish to read
my letter, you can ignore it.

96
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:25,212
But I can't help trying
to contact you this way,

97
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,716
as I'm tormented
by a persistent question:

98
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,552
Have I done you harm
in some way?

99
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:34,638
Have I unknowingly
hurt you somehow?

100
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:39,560
Was there some terrible
misunderstanding between us?"

101
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:48,152
Should I really go on?

102
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:59,747
"As far as I know,
we've been happy recently.

103
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:01,874
Surely we've never been...

104
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,418
so close.

105
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,589
Do you remember saying,

106
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,175
'I'm only just beginning
to understand

107
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,552
what it means
to be married'?

108
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,679
'You've taught me...'"

109
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,432
I can't make it out.

110
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:22,102
"'You've taught...'"
Now I see.

111
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:25,981
"'You've taught me
that we must see each other

112
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,026
as two anxious children

113
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:33,155
full of goodwill
and the best of intentions

114
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:37,576
but gov...'"
Now I see.

115
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:42,122
"'...governed by forces
we can only partially control.'

116
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:45,459
Do you remember
saying all that?

117
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,296
We were walking
in the woods,

118
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:52,341
and you stopped and grabbed
the belt of my coat..."

119
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:03,477
There was a picture
with the letter.

120
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:07,981
A picture of your son.
I don't know if...

121
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:11,026
Do you want it,
Mrs. Vogler?

122
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,197
He looks awfully cute.

123
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:50,399
Elisabet, I don't think
there's any point

124
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:52,943
in your staying here
in the hospital.

125
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,237
It's just hurting you
to be here.

126
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,531
Since you don't want
to go home,

127
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,825
I suggest you
and Sister Alma move out

128
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,035
to my summer place
by the sea.

129
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,540
You think
I don't understand?

130
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,835
The hopeless dream
of being.

131
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,254
Not seeming to be,
but being.

132
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:18,302
Conscious and awake
at every moment.

133
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:22,723
At the same time, the chasm
between what you are to others

134
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,933
and what you are
to yourself.

135
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:28,312
The feeling of vertigo,
and the constant hunger

136
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:31,064
to be unmasked
once and for all.

137
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:35,235
To be seen through,
cut down...

138
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:38,238
perhaps even annihilated.

139
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:43,201
Every tone of voice a lie,
every gesture a falsehood,

140
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,370
every smile a grimace.

141
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,665
Commit suicide?

142
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:51,919
No, too nasty.

143
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,088
One doesn't do
things like that.

144
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:58,592
But you can refuse
to move or talk.

145
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,969
Then at least
you're not lying.

146
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:04,514
You can cut yourself off,
close yourself in.

147
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,850
Then you needn't
play any roles,

148
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,895
wear any masks,
make any false gestures.

149
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,022
So you might think...

150
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,942
but reality plays
nasty tricks on you.

151
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,278
Your hiding place
isn't watertight enough.

152
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,281
Life oozes in from all sides.

153
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,703
You're forced to react.

154
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:31,041
No one asks
whether it's genuine or not,

155
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,877
whether you're lying
or telling the truth.

156
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,089
Questions like that
only matter in the theater,

157
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:39,257
and hardly even there.

158
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,636
I understand you,
Elisabet.

159
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:45,889
I understand that you're
not speaking or moving,

160
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:50,477
that you've turned this apathy
into a fantastic setup.

161
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,814
I understand
and admire you.

162
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:59,152
I think you should play this part
until it's played out,

163
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:02,239
until it's no longer
interesting.

164
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:05,993
Then you can drop it,
just as you eventually drop

165
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:08,954
all your other roles.

166
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,294
<i>Thus, at the end of the summer,
Mrs. Vogler and Sister Alma</i>

167
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,839
<i>move out to the doctor's
summer house.</i>

168
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:23,051
<i>The stay by the sea agrees
very well with the actress.</i>

169
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,054
<i>Her crippling apathy
at the hospital</i>

170
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,057
<i>gives way to long walks,
fishing excursions,</i>

171
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:32,269
<i>cooking, letter writing,
and other diversions.</i>

172
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:36,023
<i>Sister Alma enjoys
the seclusion of the countryside</i>

173
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:39,192
<i>and tends to her patient
with utmost care.</i>

174
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:24,571
Don't you know it's bad luck
to compare hands?

175
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,050
<i>Elisabet...</i>

176
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,636
<i>may I read you
something from my book?</i>

177
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,721
<i>Or am I disturbing you?</i>

178
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,556
<i>Here's what it says:</i>

179
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:54,392
<i>"All the anxiety
we carry within us,</i>

180
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:58,772
<i>all our thwarted dreams,
the inexplicable cruelty,</i>

181
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:01,108
<i>our fear of extinction,</i>

182
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:04,319
<i>the painful insight
into our earthly condition</i>

183
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:10,450
have slowly crystallized our hope
for an other-worldly salvation.

184
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:13,787
The tremendous cry
of our faith and doubt

185
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:16,081
against the darkness
and silence

186
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:20,043
is the most terrifying proof
of our abandonment

187
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:23,296
and our unuttered knowledge."

188
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,634
Do you think that's true?

189
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,807
I don't believe that.

190
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:38,645
To change...
but I'm so lazy.

191
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,398
And then
I feel guilty about it.

192
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,900
Karl-Henrik scolds me
for not having any ambition,

193
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:46,236
for going around
like I'm sleepwalking.

194
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:48,196
I think that's unfair.

195
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,866
I graduated highest
in my class.

196
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,243
But maybe he means
something else.

197
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,456
You know...
Oh, sorry.

198
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:01,334
You know what
I think about sometimes?

199
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,379
At the hospital
where I took my exam,

200
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,673
there's a home
for old nurses

201
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,302
who were nurses all their lives
and lived for their work

202
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:12,762
and were always
in uniform.

203
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,973
They live
in their little rooms there.

204
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:17,976
Imagine believing
so strongly in something

205
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:20,020
that you devote
your entire life to it.

206
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:23,106
Having something to believe in,
working at something,

207
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:26,026
believing
your life has meaning.

208
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:27,903
I like that.

209
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:31,531
Holding on tight to something,
no matter what...

210
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,575
I think that's how
it should be.

211
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,536
Meaning something
to other people.

212
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,788
Don't you agree?

213
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:46,338
I know it sounds childish,
but I believe in that.

214
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:50,217
What a downpour!

215
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:54,429
Oh, yes, he was married.

216
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:57,098
We had an affair
for five years.

217
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:59,809
Then he got tired of it,
of course.

218
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:03,855
I was terribly in love,
and he was the first.

219
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:07,442
I remember it all
like one long torment.

220
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:12,280
Long periods of agony,
and brief moments when...

221
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:16,826
Your teaching me
how to smoke reminded me.

222
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,954
He smoked constantly.

223
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:22,040
In hindsight
it all seems so dreary.

224
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:24,417
A real dime store novel.

225
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:29,756
In some strange way
it was never quite real.

226
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,426
I don't know how
to explain it.

227
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:36,763
At least, I was never
quite real to him.

228
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:40,976
But my pain was real,
that's for sure.

229
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,605
But that was somehow
all a part of it

230
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,816
in some nasty way,

231
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:50,694
as if that's how
it was supposed to be.

232
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:54,239
Even the things
we said to each other.

233
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:04,499
Lots of people have told me
I'm a good listener.

234
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:06,459
Isn't that funny?

235
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:09,379
No one's ever bothered
to listen to me.

236
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:12,465
Like you're doing now.
You're really listening.

237
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:16,469
I think you're the first person
who's ever listened to me.

238
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,805
It can't be at all interesting.

239
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:21,266
You could be reading
a good book instead.

240
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:23,977
How I'm going on!
I hope I'm not irritating you.

241
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:28,440
It feels so good to talk.
It feels nice and warm.

242
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:31,901
I've never felt like this
in all my life.

243
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,156
I've always wanted
a sister.

244
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:38,867
I have loads of brothers...
seven.

245
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:41,077
Strange, eh?
Then I came along.

246
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:44,706
I remember being surrounded
by boys all my life.

247
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,500
But I like boys.

248
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,836
But I'm sure
you know that,

249
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:52,881
with all your experience
as an actress.

250
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:56,092
I like Karl-Henrik so much,

251
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:59,679
but you really
only love once.

252
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:01,848
I'm faithful to him.

253
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:05,977
Opportunities come up
in this line of work, I can tell you.

254
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:12,567
Karl-Henrik and I rented
a cottage by the sea once.

255
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:16,071
It was June,
and we were all alone.

256
00:28:17,572 --> 00:28:19,991
One day, when Karl-Henrik
had gone into town,

257
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,327
I went to the beach
on my own.

258
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:25,330
It was a warm
and lovely day.

259
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,667
There was
another girl there.

260
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:32,754
She'd paddled over
from another island

261
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:36,549
because our beach
was sunnier and more secluded.

262
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:41,721
We lay there sunbathing beside
one another, completely naked,

263
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:45,934
dozing now and then,
putting suntan lotion on.

264
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,481
We had those cheap
straw hats on, you know?

265
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:55,652
I had a blue ribbon
around mine.

266
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:01,282
I lay there peeping out
from under my hat

267
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:05,578
at the landscape
and the sea and the sun.

268
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,956
It was kind of funny.

269
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:17,882
Suddenly I saw two figures leaping
about on the rocks above us.

270
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,679
They would hide
and then peek out.

271
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,808
"There's a couple boys
looking at us," I told the girl.

272
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,935
Her name was Katarina.

273
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:33,940
"Let them look," she said,
and turned over on her back.

274
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:37,944
It was a strange feeling.

275
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:41,406
I wanted to jump up
and put on my robe,

276
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:43,950
but I just lay there
on my stomach

277
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:46,244
with my bottom in the air,

278
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:49,789
not at all embarrassed,
completely calm.

279
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:55,378
Katarina lay there
next to me the whole time,

280
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:58,506
with her breasts
and thick thighs.

281
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:02,469
She just lay there
sort of giggling to herself.

282
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,682
I noticed that the boys
had come closer.

283
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:10,894
They just stood there
looking at us.

284
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:14,689
I noticed
they were terribly young.

285
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:19,986
Then one of them...
the more daring of the two...

286
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:24,616
came up and squatted down
next to Katarina.

287
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:29,954
He pretended to be busy
picking at his toes.

288
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,876
I felt so strange.

289
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:39,839
Suddenly
I heard Katarina say,

290
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:43,760
"Hey, why don't you
come over here?"

291
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:46,679
She took him by the hand

292
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:49,265
and helped him off
with his jeans and shirt.

293
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,684
Then suddenly
he was on top of her.

294
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:55,980
She guided him in
with her hands on his behind.

295
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:00,693
The other boy just sat
on the slope and watched.

296
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:05,698
I heard Katarina whisper
in the boy's ear and laugh.

297
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:09,869
His face was
right next to mine.

298
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:13,456
It was red and swollen.

299
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,503
Suddenly
I turned over and said,

300
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:21,256
"Aren't you coming
over to me too?"

301
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,968
And Katarina said,
"Go to her now."

302
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:27,303
He pulled out of her

303
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,598
and fell on top of me,
completely hard.

304
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,767
He grabbed my breast.

305
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:34,894
It hurt so bad!

306
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:39,566
I was ready somehow
and came almost at once.

307
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,568
Can you believe it?

308
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:46,864
I was about to say,
"Careful you don't get me pregnant"

309
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,200
when he suddenly came.

310
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:52,870
I felt it like
never before in my life,

311
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:56,249
the way he sprayed
his seed into me.

312
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:59,794
He gripped my shoulders
and arched backward.

313
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,255
I came over and over.

314
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:08,052
Katarina lay on her side
and watched

315
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:10,722
and held him from behind.

316
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:16,311
After he came,
she took him in her arms

317
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:19,063
and used his hand
to make herself come.

318
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:21,441
When she came,

319
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,818
she screamed
like a banshee.

320
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:32,869
Then all three of us
started laughing.

321
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:36,664
We called to the other boy,
who was sitting on the slope.

322
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,791
His name was Peter.

323
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:45,131
He came down,
looking all confused

324
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:47,550
and shivering
despite the sunshine.

325
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:54,015
Katarina unbuttoned his pants
and started to play with him.

326
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:58,478
And when he came,
she took him in her mouth.

327
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:02,482
He bent down
and kissed her back.

328
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,069
She turned around,
took his head in both hands,

329
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:07,904
and gave him her breast.

330
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:12,033
The other boy got so excited
that he and I started all over again.

331
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,328
It was just as good
as before.

332
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:20,958
Then we went for a swim
and parted ways.

333
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:24,921
When I got home, Karl-Henrik
was already back from town.

334
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,344
We ate dinner and drank
some red wine he'd brought.

335
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,765
Then we had sex.

336
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:40,269
It's never been as good,
before or since.

337
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,021
Can you understand that?

338
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:45,608
I ended up pregnant,
of course.

339
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:49,195
Karl-Henrik,
who's studying medicine,

340
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,366
took me to a good friend of his,
who performed an abortion.

341
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,537
We were both relieved.
We didn't want children.

342
00:33:57,912 --> 00:34:00,206
Not then, anyway.

343
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:09,048
It doesn't make any sense.

344
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:12,301
Nothing fits together.

345
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:16,431
And the guilty conscience
you feel over little things.

346
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:18,558
You understand?

347
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:21,978
And what about all the things
you'd decided to do?

348
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:24,897
Don't you have
to do them anymore?

349
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:28,526
Is it possible to be

350
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:31,654
one and the same person
at the very same time...

351
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:33,823
I mean, two people?

352
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:36,117
God, I'm being silly!

353
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:39,746
Anyway, there's no reason
to start blubbering.

354
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:43,082
I'll get a handkerchief.

355
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:06,522
It's almost morning...

356
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:09,901
and it's still raining.

357
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:19,243
I've been talking nonstop

358
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:21,454
while you've just listened.

359
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,372
How boring for you.

360
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:26,501
What could possibly
interest you about my life?

361
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:29,462
People should be like you.

362
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:33,007
You know what I thought

363
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,802
after I saw a film
of yours one night?

364
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:38,805
When I got home and looked
in the mirror, I thought,

365
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,932
"We look alike."

366
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:44,352
Don't get me wrong.
You're much more beautiful.

367
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:46,479
But we're alike somehow.

368
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:50,900
I think I could turn into you
if I really tried.

369
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:53,319
I mean inside.

370
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:58,324
You could be me
just like that...

371
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:02,078
though your soul
would be far too big.

372
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:04,664
It would stick out
everywhere!

373
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,169
<i>Go to bed...</i>

374
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:13,005
<i>or you'll fall asleep
here at the table.</i>

375
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:29,063
I must go to bed now

376
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:31,524
or I'll fall asleep
at the table,

377
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:34,068
and that would be
rather uncomfortable.

378
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:39,365
Good night.

379
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:41,547
Elisabet...

380
00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:46,719
did you speak to me
last night?

381
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,753
Were you
in my room last night?

382
00:41:03,337 --> 00:41:05,673
Shall I take your mail too?

383
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:08,884
Let me have a taste.

384
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:12,263
See ya.

385
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:22,082
"Dear friend,
I could live like this forever.

386
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:25,169
The silence, the seclusion,
reducing my needs,

387
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:29,215
feeling my battered soul finally
start to straighten itself out.

388
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:37,890
Alma pampers me
in the most touching way.

389
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:43,896
I think she's actually enjoying it here
and that she's very fond of me,

390
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:47,983
perhaps even a bit smitten
in a charming, subconscious way.

391
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:51,737
In any case,
it's a lot of fun studying her.

392
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:03,999
Sometimes she cries
over past sins...

393
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:07,211
an orgy with a strange boy
and a subsequent abortion.

394
00:43:07,336 --> 00:43:10,130
She complains
that her notions about life

395
00:43:10,256 --> 00:43:13,008
fail to accord with her actions."

396
00:48:57,436 --> 00:48:59,605
I see
you're reading a play.

397
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:03,400
That's a healthy sign.
I'll tell the doctor.

398
00:49:06,737 --> 00:49:08,822
You think we should
leave here soon?

399
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:11,158
I'm starting
to miss the city.

400
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:13,368
Aren't you?

401
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:32,095
Would you like
to make me really happy?

402
00:49:33,305 --> 00:49:36,975
I know it's asking a lot,
but I could use your help right now.

403
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:39,102
Nothing dangerous.

404
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:41,980
But I do wish
you'd talk to me.

405
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:44,316
Doesn't have to be
anything special.

406
00:49:44,483 --> 00:49:47,986
We could talk about anything...
what to have for dinner,

407
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:50,739
whether the water's
cold now after the storm,

408
00:49:50,864 --> 00:49:53,325
whether it's too cold
to go swimming.

409
00:49:53,492 --> 00:49:56,578
Just talk for a few minutes.
One minute.

410
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:58,997
You could read to me
from your book.

411
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:00,582
Just say a few words.

412
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:05,671
I have to try
not to get angry.

413
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:07,964
It's your business
if you want to keep quiet.

414
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:11,093
But I need you
to talk to me now.

415
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,555
Can't you just say

416
00:50:15,681 --> 00:50:17,224
one word?

417
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:21,937
I knew you'd refuse.

418
00:50:23,146 --> 00:50:25,357
You can't know how I feel.

419
00:50:26,983 --> 00:50:29,361
I always thought great artists

420
00:50:29,528 --> 00:50:32,447
felt this great compassion
for other people...

421
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:35,909
that they created
out of great compassion

422
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:38,036
and a need to help.

423
00:50:38,203 --> 00:50:40,205
That was silly of me.

424
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,753
You've used me.
For what, I don't know.

425
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:50,382
Now that you don't need me
anymore, you toss me aside.

426
00:50:50,507 --> 00:50:54,219
Yes, I hear perfectly well
how phony that sounds!

427
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:56,805
"You've used me, and now
you're tossing me aside."

428
00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:00,058
But it's true... every word.
And these glasses!

429
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:11,069
You've hurt me badly.

430
00:51:11,862 --> 00:51:14,531
You've been laughing at me
behind my back.

431
00:51:16,408 --> 00:51:18,869
I read the letter
you wrote to the doctor.

432
00:51:18,994 --> 00:51:23,081
It wasn't sealed,
and I read the whole thing.

433
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:27,294
You got me to talk,

434
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:29,755
to tell you things
I've never told anyone.

435
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,008
Then you go and pass it on.
Great study material, eh?

436
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:34,718
You're not...

437
00:51:34,968 --> 00:51:36,970
You're going to talk now!

438
00:51:37,095 --> 00:51:40,348
If you have something
to say, by God...

439
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:55,280
No, don't!

440
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:09,628
Scared there for a minute,
weren't you?

441
00:52:11,463 --> 00:52:15,342
For a second you were
genuinely scared, weren't you?

442
00:52:15,926 --> 00:52:18,470
A genuine
fear of death, huh?

443
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:21,640
"Alma's gone crazy,"
you thought.

444
00:52:21,807 --> 00:52:24,392
Just what kind of person
are you anyway?

445
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:28,855
Or maybe you just thought,
"I'll remember that face,

446
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,691
that tone of voice,
that expression."

447
00:52:31,817 --> 00:52:34,319
I'll give you something
you won't forget!

448
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:58,009
You're laughing, are you?

449
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:02,180
Things aren't
that simple for me.

450
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:04,683
Or so funny either.

451
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:08,019
But you always have
your laugh.

452
00:54:33,355 --> 00:54:35,607
Does it have
to be like this?

453
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,489
Is it really so important
not to lie, to tell the truth,

454
00:54:42,614 --> 00:54:44,950
to speak in a genuine
tone of voice?

455
00:54:45,951 --> 00:54:49,287
Can a person really live
without babbling away,

456
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:53,500
without lying and making up
excuses and evading things?

457
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:57,379
Isn't it better
to just let yourself

458
00:54:57,504 --> 00:55:00,340
be silly and sloppy
and dishonest?

459
00:55:02,092 --> 00:55:06,304
Maybe a person gets better by just
letting herself be who she is.

460
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:12,143
No, you don't understand.

461
00:55:13,228 --> 00:55:14,980
You don't understand
what I'm saying.

462
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:17,190
There's no reaching
someone like you.

463
00:55:17,315 --> 00:55:19,275
The doctor said
you're mentally healthy,

464
00:55:19,401 --> 00:55:21,486
but I wonder if your madness
isn't the worst kind.

465
00:55:21,653 --> 00:55:23,321
You <i>act</i> healthy,

466
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:25,991
and the worst thing is,
everyone believes you.

467
00:55:26,116 --> 00:55:29,327
Except me, because
I know how rotten you are.

468
00:55:35,709 --> 00:55:37,502
God, what am I doing?

469
00:55:41,006 --> 00:55:43,133
Elisabet, forgive me.

470
00:55:43,258 --> 00:55:45,218
I'm behaving like an idiot.

471
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:48,972
I don't know what got into me.
I'm here to help you.

472
00:55:49,097 --> 00:55:51,683
It was that awful letter.

473
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:53,852
I was so disappointed.

474
00:55:54,019 --> 00:55:57,439
You asked me
to talk about myself.

475
00:55:58,023 --> 00:56:00,650
It felt so good. You seemed
so kind and understanding.

476
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:02,861
I'd had a lot to drink,

477
00:56:03,028 --> 00:56:05,488
and it felt so good
to talk about it all.

478
00:56:05,613 --> 00:56:07,949
And I suppose
I was flattered

479
00:56:08,074 --> 00:56:11,536
that a great actress like you
would bother to listen.

480
00:56:11,703 --> 00:56:14,289
I even thought
it would be nice if what I said

481
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:16,708
were of some use to you.

482
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:20,712
But that's awful, isn't it?
Sheer exhibitionism.

483
00:56:20,879 --> 00:56:23,882
Elisabet,
I want you to forgive me.

484
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:27,260
I like you so much.
You mean so much to me.

485
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:29,304
I've learned
so much from you.

486
00:56:29,429 --> 00:56:31,306
Let's not part as enemies.

487
00:56:54,412 --> 00:56:58,249
You won't forgive me
because you're too proud!

488
00:56:58,374 --> 00:57:02,253
You won't stoop to my level
because you don't have to!

489
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,423
I won't...

490
01:01:11,461 --> 01:01:13,504
<i>...we don't speak...</i>

491
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:14,881
<i>...don't listen...</i>

492
01:01:15,006 --> 01:01:16,716
<i>...can't understand...</i>

493
01:01:21,471 --> 01:01:23,139
<i>...what means...</i>

494
01:01:23,264 --> 01:01:25,641
<i>...to persuade... to listen...</i>

495
01:02:09,143 --> 01:02:11,979
When you sleep,
your face goes slack...

496
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:17,527
and your mouth
is swollen and ugly.

497
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:23,241
There's a nasty wrinkle
on your forehead.

498
01:02:31,499 --> 01:02:34,252
You smell
of sleep and tears...

499
01:02:38,256 --> 01:02:41,008
and I can see
the pulse in your neck.

500
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:45,304
There's a scar there
that you cover with makeup.

501
01:02:51,436 --> 01:02:53,479
He's calling again.

502
01:02:55,022 --> 01:02:57,525
I'll find out
what he wants from us...

503
01:02:58,526 --> 01:03:01,529
far away out here
in our solitude.

504
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:30,808
Sorry if I frightened you.

505
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:33,895
I'm not Elisabet.

506
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,689
I'm not here
to make demands.

507
01:03:37,148 --> 01:03:39,275
I didn't mean to disturb you.

508
01:03:39,484 --> 01:03:41,569
You think
I don't understand?

509
01:03:41,694 --> 01:03:44,489
The doctor
explained everything.

510
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:49,619
But the hardest part
is explaining to your little boy.

511
01:03:49,744 --> 01:03:51,787
I do the best I can.

512
01:03:53,331 --> 01:03:57,210
There's something deeper down,
hard to get a grip on.

513
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:02,298
You love someone...
or rather, you say you do.

514
01:04:03,216 --> 01:04:07,094
It's something tangible...
at least, as far as words can be.

515
01:04:08,513 --> 01:04:12,016
Mr. Vogler,
I'm not your wife.

516
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:14,393
And you're loved as well.

517
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:16,521
You build a community.

518
01:04:17,063 --> 01:04:19,148
It gives you security.

519
01:04:19,524 --> 01:04:22,151
You see a possible way
of enduring, don't you?

520
01:04:25,238 --> 01:04:29,367
How can I say everything
I've thought without getting lost...

521
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,869
without boring you?

522
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:43,381
I love you
as much as ever.

523
01:04:50,429 --> 01:04:53,266
No, don't worry, my love.

524
01:04:53,766 --> 01:04:57,061
We have each other.
We have faith in each other.

525
01:04:57,186 --> 01:05:00,273
We know each other's thoughts.
We love each other.

526
01:05:00,398 --> 01:05:02,483
That's true, isn't it?
- Yes.

527
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:06,862
And it's the effort that counts,
not what we achieve, right?

528
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:11,325
To see each other
as children,

529
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:14,161
tormented, helpless,
lonely children.

530
01:05:16,706 --> 01:05:20,334
Tell our little boy
Mommy will be back soon,

531
01:05:20,876 --> 01:05:24,547
that Mommy's been ill,
but she longs for her little boy.

532
01:05:24,797 --> 01:05:27,758
Remember to buy
a toy for him.

533
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:30,344
A present from Mommy.
Don't forget.

534
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:32,847
I feel such great
tenderness for you.

535
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,936
It's almost unbearable.

536
01:05:40,354 --> 01:05:43,190
I don't know what to do
with my tenderness.

537
01:05:45,067 --> 01:05:47,653
I thrive on your tenderness.

538
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,491
Elisabet, is it good
for you with me?

539
01:05:53,075 --> 01:05:55,077
Is it good for you?

540
01:05:57,288 --> 01:06:00,583
You're a wonderful lover.
You know that.

541
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:02,293
Darling!

542
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:06,213
Give me a sedative.

543
01:06:06,339 --> 01:06:09,634
Toss me aside.
I can't go on!

544
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,052
My darling...

545
01:06:11,177 --> 01:06:12,595
Leave me alone!

546
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,889
This is shameful, all of it!

547
01:06:15,473 --> 01:06:17,141
Leave me alone!

548
01:06:17,308 --> 01:06:19,935
I'm cold and rotten
and indifferent.

549
01:06:20,853 --> 01:06:23,648
It's all just a sham and lies!

550
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:34,867
What have you got there?

551
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:38,162
What are you hiding
under your hand?

552
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:39,914
Let me see.

553
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:47,505
It's the picture of your little boy,
the one you tore up.

554
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:49,715
We have to talk about this.

555
01:06:57,682 --> 01:06:59,850
Tell me now, Elisabet.

556
01:07:01,102 --> 01:07:02,978
Then I will.

557
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:07,316
It happened at a party one night,
didn't it?

558
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:10,444
It was late, and the party
was quite rowdy.

559
01:07:11,612 --> 01:07:14,782
Toward morning someone
in the group said to you...

560
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:17,910
"Elisabet, you have
practically everything

561
01:07:18,035 --> 01:07:20,037
as a woman
and as an artist,

562
01:07:20,204 --> 01:07:22,498
but you lack motherliness."

563
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:27,378
You laughed,
thinking it was ridiculous,

564
01:07:28,087 --> 01:07:32,091
but later you found yourself
thinking about what he'd said.

565
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:36,178
You grew
more and more worried...

566
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:39,765
so you let your husband
get you pregnant.

567
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:42,059
You wanted
to be a mother.

568
01:07:43,394 --> 01:07:46,897
When you knew it was definite,
you became afraid...

569
01:07:47,022 --> 01:07:50,025
afraid of responsibility,
of being tied down,

570
01:07:50,151 --> 01:07:52,528
of leaving
the theater behind,

571
01:07:53,154 --> 01:07:55,781
afraid of pain,
afraid of dying,

572
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,659
afraid of your body
that was swelling up.

573
01:07:59,869 --> 01:08:02,371
But you played
the part the whole time,

574
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:06,041
the part of the young,
happy, expectant mother.

575
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:09,462
Everyone said,
"Isn't she beautiful now?

576
01:08:09,587 --> 01:08:11,922
She's never been
so beautiful."

577
01:08:14,759 --> 01:08:18,179
Meanwhile you tried
several times to abort.

578
01:08:19,722 --> 01:08:21,599
But you failed.

579
01:08:22,391 --> 01:08:24,602
When you realized
it was inevitable,

580
01:08:24,727 --> 01:08:27,021
you began
to hate the baby

581
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:29,857
and hoped
it would be stillborn.

582
01:08:33,235 --> 01:08:36,197
You hoped
the baby would be dead.

583
01:08:38,407 --> 01:08:41,118
You wanted a dead baby.

584
01:08:45,956 --> 01:08:48,834
It was a long
and difficult delivery.

585
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:51,128
You were in agony
for days.

586
01:08:52,505 --> 01:08:55,049
The baby was finally
delivered with forceps.

587
01:08:55,174 --> 01:08:59,470
You looked with disgust at your
squealing child and whispered,

588
01:08:59,595 --> 01:09:02,348
"Can't you just die?
Can't you die?"

589
01:09:04,809 --> 01:09:06,727
But he survived.

590
01:09:08,312 --> 01:09:10,981
The boy cried
day and night...

591
01:09:14,026 --> 01:09:16,070
and you hated him.

592
01:09:16,904 --> 01:09:20,407
You were afraid.
You had a guilty conscience.

593
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:24,995
In the end,
some relatives and a nanny

594
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,164
took care of the boy,

595
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:31,293
and you could leave your sickbed
and return to the theater.

596
01:09:34,129 --> 01:09:36,507
But the suffering wasn't over.

597
01:09:37,633 --> 01:09:39,677
The boy was seized

598
01:09:39,844 --> 01:09:42,596
by a vast, unfathomable love
for his mother.

599
01:09:42,972 --> 01:09:44,932
You resist.

600
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:47,393
You resist desperately,

601
01:09:47,768 --> 01:09:50,646
because you feel
you can't return that love.

602
01:09:50,771 --> 01:09:53,148
You try and try...

603
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:58,153
but your encounters with him
are cruel and awkward.

604
01:09:58,279 --> 01:10:00,030
You can't do it.

605
01:10:00,155 --> 01:10:02,199
You're cold and indifferent.

606
01:10:03,242 --> 01:10:05,369
And he looks at you.

607
01:10:05,536 --> 01:10:08,455
He loves you,
and he's so soft,

608
01:10:08,581 --> 01:10:12,042
and you want to hit him
for not leaving you alone.

609
01:10:13,127 --> 01:10:17,131
You find him repulsive,
with his thick lips and ugly body

610
01:10:17,256 --> 01:10:19,884
and his moist, pleading eyes.

611
01:10:20,009 --> 01:10:22,553
You find him repulsive,
and you're afraid.

612
01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:25,806
What have you got there?

613
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:28,726
What are you hiding
under your hand?

614
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:30,603
Let me see.

615
01:10:34,982 --> 01:10:38,736
It's the picture of your little boy,
the one you tore up.

616
01:10:38,986 --> 01:10:41,196
We have to talk about this.

617
01:10:49,872 --> 01:10:52,166
Tell me now, Elisabet.

618
01:10:55,085 --> 01:10:57,004
Then I will.

619
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:02,509
It happened at a party one night,
didn't it?

620
01:11:03,344 --> 01:11:05,679
It was late, and the party
was quite rowdy.

621
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:10,851
Toward morning someone
in the group said to you...

622
01:11:11,393 --> 01:11:14,063
"Elisabet, you have
practically everything

623
01:11:14,188 --> 01:11:16,315
as a woman
and as an artist,

624
01:11:16,523 --> 01:11:18,943
but you lack motherliness."

625
01:11:20,736 --> 01:11:24,031
You laughed,
thinking it was ridiculous,

626
01:11:25,115 --> 01:11:29,119
but later you found yourself
thinking about what he'd said.

627
01:11:29,453 --> 01:11:31,789
You grew
more and more worried...

628
01:11:32,581 --> 01:11:35,334
so you let your husband
get you pregnant.

629
01:11:37,086 --> 01:11:39,254
You wanted
to be a mother.

630
01:11:41,715 --> 01:11:45,219
When you knew it was definite,
you became afraid...

631
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:49,890
afraid of responsibility,
of being tied down,

632
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,309
of leaving
the theater behind,

633
01:11:53,018 --> 01:11:55,562
afraid of pain,
afraid of dying,

634
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,691
afraid of your body
that was swelling up.

635
01:12:01,026 --> 01:12:03,487
But you played
the part the whole time,

636
01:12:03,612 --> 01:12:06,991
the part of the young,
happy, expectant mother.

637
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:10,536
Everyone said,
"Isn't she beautiful now?

638
01:12:10,661 --> 01:12:12,663
She's never been
so beautiful."

639
01:12:14,248 --> 01:12:17,751
Meanwhile you tried
several times to abort.

640
01:12:18,627 --> 01:12:20,587
But you failed.

641
01:12:22,214 --> 01:12:24,675
When you realized
it was inevitable...

642
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:28,721
you began
to hate the baby...

643
01:12:30,681 --> 01:12:33,434
and hoped
it would be stillborn.

644
01:12:36,812 --> 01:12:39,815
You hoped
the baby would be dead.

645
01:12:44,028 --> 01:12:46,655
You wanted a dead baby.

646
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:53,829
It was a long
and difficult delivery.

647
01:12:54,496 --> 01:12:56,749
You were in agony
for days.

648
01:12:58,042 --> 01:13:00,711
The baby was finally
delivered with forceps.

649
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:05,674
You looked with disgust at your
squealing child and whispered,

650
01:13:05,799 --> 01:13:07,926
"Can't you just die?

651
01:13:08,052 --> 01:13:09,887
Can't you die?"

652
01:13:10,554 --> 01:13:13,182
The boy cried
day and night,

653
01:13:13,307 --> 01:13:15,392
and you hated him.

654
01:13:16,101 --> 01:13:19,563
You were afraid.
You had a guilty conscience.

655
01:13:21,732 --> 01:13:24,068
In the end,
some relatives and a nanny

656
01:13:24,193 --> 01:13:26,195
took care of the boy,

657
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:30,240
and you could leave your sickbed
and return to the theater.

658
01:13:32,284 --> 01:13:34,161
But the suffering wasn't over.

659
01:13:36,622 --> 01:13:38,665
The boy was seized

660
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:41,710
by a vast, unfathomable love
for his mother.

661
01:13:42,211 --> 01:13:45,005
You resist desperately,

662
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:48,342
because you feel
you can't return that love.

663
01:13:48,467 --> 01:13:50,761
You try and try...

664
01:13:51,804 --> 01:13:55,474
but your encounters with him
are cruel and awkward.

665
01:13:55,599 --> 01:13:57,434
You can't do it.

666
01:13:58,102 --> 01:14:00,562
You're cold and indifferent.

667
01:14:01,438 --> 01:14:03,524
And he looks at you.

668
01:14:03,774 --> 01:14:06,610
He loves you,
and he's so soft,

669
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:10,447
and you want to hit him
for not leaving you alone.

670
01:14:11,323 --> 01:14:15,285
You find him repulsive,
with his thick lips and ugly body

671
01:14:15,452 --> 01:14:18,038
and his moist, pleading eyes.

672
01:14:18,163 --> 01:14:20,749
You find him repulsive,
and you're afraid.

673
01:14:28,841 --> 01:14:30,342
No!

674
01:14:31,802 --> 01:14:33,804
I'm not like you.

675
01:14:34,138 --> 01:14:36,473
I don't feel
the same way you do.

676
01:14:37,099 --> 01:14:40,602
I'm Sister Alma.
I'm only here to help you.

677
01:14:40,894 --> 01:14:42,938
I'm not Elisabet Vogler.

678
01:14:43,063 --> 01:14:45,232
You're Elisabet Vogler.

679
01:14:45,649 --> 01:14:47,776
I'd really like to have...

680
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:50,988
I love...

681
01:14:53,323 --> 01:14:54,825
I haven't...

682
01:15:29,026 --> 01:15:31,111
I've learned quite a lot.

683
01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:48,212
Let's see how long
I can hold out.

684
01:15:54,343 --> 01:15:58,222
I'll never be like you.
I change all the time.

685
01:15:58,347 --> 01:16:01,225
You can do what you want.
You won't get to me.

686
01:16:35,467 --> 01:16:37,261
Say nothing.

687
01:16:38,387 --> 01:16:40,264
Cut a candle.

688
01:16:40,389 --> 01:16:42,349
A kind of otherness.

689
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:45,102
Not now. No, no.

690
01:16:46,478 --> 01:16:49,147
Warning and outside time.

691
01:16:49,273 --> 01:16:50,816
Unforeseen.

692
01:16:50,941 --> 01:16:54,778
When it was supposed to happen,
it didn't, so... failure.

693
01:16:54,945 --> 01:16:56,863
You stand there,

694
01:16:56,989 --> 01:16:58,949
but I should do it.

695
01:16:59,116 --> 01:17:00,993
Not inward, no.

696
01:17:01,118 --> 01:17:03,370
Say collect
and advise others.

697
01:17:03,495 --> 01:17:05,831
A desperate maybe.

698
01:17:11,044 --> 01:17:14,798
I take, yes...
but what is closest?

699
01:17:15,507 --> 01:17:17,551
What's it called?

700
01:17:17,676 --> 01:17:19,303
No, no, no.

701
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:22,681
Us, we, me, I.

702
01:17:22,806 --> 01:17:25,267
Many words
and then disgust,

703
01:17:25,392 --> 01:17:28,854
unbearable pain,
the nausea.

704
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:03,240
Try and listen to me now.

705
01:19:03,949 --> 01:19:06,243
Repeat after me.

706
01:19:10,622 --> 01:19:12,207
Nothing.

707
01:19:15,752 --> 01:19:17,254
Nothing.

708
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:20,465
No, nothing.

709
01:19:27,431 --> 01:19:28,932
Nothing.

710
01:19:30,434 --> 01:19:32,018
That's it.

711
01:19:32,394 --> 01:19:34,104
That's good.

712
01:19:34,229 --> 01:19:36,273
That's how it should be.
