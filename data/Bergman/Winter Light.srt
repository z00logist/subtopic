2
00:01:37,844 --> 00:01:41,940
Our Lord, Jesus Christ,
on the night He was betrayed,

3
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,850
took bread, gave thanks, broke it,

4
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:48,944
and gave it
unto His disciples, saying:

5
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:54,617
Take and eat. This is my Body
which is given up for you.

6
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:57,687
Do this in remembrance of me.

7
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:03,980
Likewise he took the cup,
gave thanks,

8
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:07,403
and gave it to them, saying,
Drink ye all of it.

9
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:11,234
For this is my blood
of the new testament

10
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:14,871
which is shed for many
for the remission of sin.

11
00:02:16,183 --> 00:02:19,812
Do this, as oft as ye drink it,
in remembrance of me.

12
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:26,150
Let us now pray together,
even as our Lord Jesus hath taught us.

13
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,459
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

14
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:39,594
<i>Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,</i>
<i>on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

15
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:44,970
<i>Give us this day our daily bread</i>
<i>and forgive us our trespasses,</i>

16
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,377
<i>as we forgive those</i>
<i>who trespass against us.</i>

17
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:53,241
<i>And lead us not into temptation,</i>
<i>but deliver us from evil.</i>

18
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:59,189
<i>For Thine is the kingdom,</i>
<i>and the power, and the glory forever.</i>

19
00:03:01,762 --> 00:03:02,956
Amen.

20
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,304
The peace of God be with you.

21
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:22,370
<i>O Lamb of God</i>

22
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:29,444
<i>That takest away</i>
<i>the sins of the world</i>

23
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:40,722
<i>Give us salvation, O merciful Lord</i>

24
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:51,867
<i>O Lamb of God</i>

25
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:58,440
<i>That takest away</i>
<i>the sins of the world</i>

26
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:10,850
<i>Hear our prayers, O merciful Lord</i>

27
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:21,263
<i>O Lamb of God</i>

28
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:27,208
<i>That takest away</i>

29
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:33,275
<i>The sins of the world</i>

30
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:38,920
<i>Grant us peace</i>

31
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,986
<i>And bless our day</i>

32
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,941
Look straight ahead
and fold your hands.

33
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:47,993
The body of our Lord Jesus Christ,
which was given for you.

34
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:57,328
The body of our Lord Jesus Christ.

35
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:05,194
The blood of Christ, shed for thee.

36
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:23,922
The blood of Christ, shed for thee.

37
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,852
The grace and peace of our Lord
jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

38
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:32,490
Go in the peace of the Lord.

39
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:44,698
Thanks.

40
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,350
Let us pray.

41
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:13,890
We thank thee, Almighty Father,
who, through Thy Son Jesus Christ,

42
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:19,270
hast instituted this holy communion
to our consolation and bliss.

43
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:24,610
We pray thee: Give us grace
so to commemorateJesus on earth

44
00:09:25,145 --> 00:09:29,582
that we may be partakers
in Thy great communion in heaven.

45
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,840
Give thanks and praise
unto the Lord.

46
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:48,828
<i>Praise and thanks be unto the Lord</i>

47
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:53,650
<i>Hallelujah</i>

48
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:15,220
Humble your hearts before God
and receive His blessing.

49
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:18,624
The Lord bless you
and preserve you.

50
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:22,596
The Lord let the light
of His countenance shine upon you,

51
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:24,763
and be gracious unto you.

52
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,565
The Lord turn His face toward you

53
00:10:28,675 --> 00:10:31,410
and grant you peace.

54
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:34,645
In the name of the Father, the Son,

55
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:37,642
and the Holy Ghost.

56
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:39,913
Amen.

57
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:13,750
<i>Yet, dear Lord</i>
<i>I bow down in prayer</i>

58
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:21,123
<i>Take my hand firmly into Thine</i>

59
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:28,633
<i>Lead me then, my dearest savior</i>

60
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:36,464
<i>Take me to the land divine</i>

61
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:43,607
<i>And where earthly woes are ended</i>

62
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:50,315
<i>And my course is finally run</i>

63
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:58,825
<i>Thou wilt take my spirit with Thee</i>

64
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:04,892
<i>To share eternity</i>
<i>in that house of Thine</i>

65
00:12:58,391 --> 00:13:00,586
Time to go home.

66
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:11,219
- You don't look so good.
- I just need some rest.

67
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,694
Can't Reverend Broms
take the service at Frostnäs?

68
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:18,430
No, he's taking
the new car out for a spin.

69
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,973
- I bet you have the flu.
- My throat's pretty sore.

70
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:26,978
Tomas.

71
00:14:28,548 --> 00:14:31,142
How did it turn out?
- What?

72
00:14:31,818 --> 00:14:34,378
- Did you find a housekeeper?
- No.

73
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:38,830
You won't be able to manage
on your own in the long run.

74
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:40,910
I've managed
for five years now.

75
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:45,489
Why don't you ask Märta Lundberg?

76
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:48,594
She's dying to help you out.

77
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,994
I'd be glad to ask her.

78
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:54,470
No, thank you.

79
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:59,644
- Hello, Pastor Ericsson.
- Hello, Mr. Froevik.

80
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:03,400
- Hi there, Aronsson.
- Hi, Algot.

81
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:07,482
How are you?
Thanks for the sermon.

82
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:10,980
Can we help you with something?

83
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,490
No, I thought I might be of service.

84
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:17,493
Well, there was one thing.

85
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:19,890
I need to talk to you, Pastor.

86
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:21,864
I'll be at Frostnäs at three.

87
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:24,132
And you'll have time to see me?

88
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:26,340
Of course, after the service.

89
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:29,232
I'll be at the church an hour
beforehand to turn the heat up.

90
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:34,637
Will we be using the same hymns?

91
00:15:38,784 --> 00:15:41,140
You don't look well.

92
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,712
I've come down with a cold.

93
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:45,552
I bet it's the weather.
I always... -

94
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:46,682
Right.

95
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,564
He has his disability pension
from the railway company

96
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:04,666
and a pittance for his services
from the church council, I suppose.

97
00:16:15,555 --> 00:16:17,450
You have a visitor.

98
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,757
Mrs. Persson
would like to have a word.

99
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,966
I've got to talk to you, Pastor.

100
00:16:30,202 --> 00:16:32,568
Yes, of course.

101
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:36,204
I'll call you this evening
in case you need a hand.

102
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:38,400
Thanks, but that's not necessary.

103
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,702
Please have a seat.

104
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,215
Good-bye, Mr. And Mrs. Persson.

105
00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:58,830
You wished to speak to me?

106
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:01,990
Yes.

107
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:04,293
Actually, that's not the whole truth.

108
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:07,132
Actually, Jonas is the one... -

109
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:13,600
But he won't talk about it,

110
00:17:13,913 --> 00:17:18,782
so this morning I decided we should
come to church and see someone.

111
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,512
You see, we're feeling so lost.

112
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:28,120
Well, not me so much,

113
00:17:28,227 --> 00:17:30,491
butJonas is at his wit's end.

114
00:17:32,832 --> 00:17:34,857
Could you talk to him, please?

115
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:36,696
Of course.

116
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:43,732
How long have you felt troubled?

117
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,878
It started last spring.
Jonas read about China in the papers.

118
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,390
The article said the Chinese people
were brought up to hate...

119
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:06,540
and that it's only a matter of time
before China has atom bombs.

120
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:09,965
They have nothing to lose.
That's what they wrote.

121
00:18:12,605 --> 00:18:15,301
It doesn't worry me all that much.

122
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:19,740
Maybe I'm just short on imagination.

123
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:25,415
ButJonas can't stop thinking about it,
and so we discuss it constantly,

124
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,544
though I can't help him much.

125
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:32,255
Not with three kids
and one on the way.

126
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:36,853
Right.

127
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:41,633
Everyone feels this dread...

128
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:44,334
to some extent.

129
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:48,266
We must trust God.

130
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:24,132
We live our simple daily lives,

131
00:19:24,243 --> 00:19:26,837
and atrocities shatter
the security of our world.

132
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:32,106
It's so overwhelming,
and God seems so very remote.

133
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:34,544
That's right.

134
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:38,115
I feel so helpless.

135
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,153
I don't know what to say.

136
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,121
I understand your anguish...

137
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,531
but life must go on.

138
00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:48,497
Why do we have to go on living?

139
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,966
The pastor's not feeling well.
I shouldn't be bothering you with this.

140
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:02,130
Besides, we're powerless to do anything.
- Let's discuss it.

141
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:03,479
That's impossible.

142
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,947
Take me home and then come back.

143
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,311
You and the pastor
need to talk in private.

144
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:11,946
When can you be back?

145
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,618
- We live 10 minutes away.
- I'll see you in 20 minutes.

146
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:18,556
Promise the pastor you'll be here.

147
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,492
All right, I promise.

148
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:24,666
Is your car in the parking lot?

149
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,203
Yes, off in the corner.

150
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:30,207
I'll be expecting you
within half an hour.

151
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,273
I'll make sure he comes.

152
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,338
I'll be waiting for you.

153
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,852
I'll be waiting right here.

154
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,912
What a ridiculous image.

155
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:48,884
Oh, it's you.

156
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:51,752
Here's something nice and hot.

157
00:21:51,857 --> 00:21:53,950
Oh, I brought coffee with me.

158
00:22:02,301 --> 00:22:05,236
I'm expecting a visitor any minute.

159
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:08,320
Don't worry.
I won't stay long.

160
00:22:14,613 --> 00:22:17,104
It's getting pretty cold out.

161
00:22:24,156 --> 00:22:26,590
Poor Tomas.

162
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:31,727
What is it, Tomas?
- It wouldn't matter to you.

163
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,821
Tell me anyway.

164
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:36,962
God's silence.

165
00:22:37,603 --> 00:22:39,230
God's silence?

166
00:22:40,973 --> 00:22:42,497
God's silence.

167
00:22:46,612 --> 00:22:51,549
Jonas Persson and his wife were here,
and I could only spout drivel.

168
00:22:52,918 --> 00:22:55,443
Yet I had the feeling that each word
was decisive somehow.

169
00:22:57,723 --> 00:22:59,691
What am I to do?

170
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:03,288
Poor little Tomas.

171
00:23:03,395 --> 00:23:07,627
You should be in bed with a brandy.
You're running quite a temperature.

172
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:09,998
Why did you take communion?

173
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:13,229
It's a love feast, isn't it?

174
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:16,130
Did you read my letter?

175
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:19,142
No. I haven't had the time.

176
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:20,677
You're hopeless.

177
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,574
When did it arrive?
- Yesterday. It's on my desk... -

178
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:29,187
Read it later, when you feel like it.

179
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,233
Another Sunday in the vale of tears.

180
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:45,431
I don't feel very well.

181
00:23:45,704 --> 00:23:47,797
- Want me to feel sorry for you?
- Yes, please.

182
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:49,737
Then you'll have to marry me.

183
00:23:49,842 --> 00:23:50,934
Oh?

184
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,874
You should marry me.

185
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:54,445
Why?

186
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,747
Then I wouldn't have
to leave this place.

187
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,450
Why would you have to leave?

188
00:24:00,152 --> 00:24:03,530
As long as I'm a substitute,
I can be transferred.

189
00:24:03,155 --> 00:24:04,918
Far away from you.

190
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:07,720
We'll see what happens.

191
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:10,387
Yes, I know.

192
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,894
You can't marry me
because you don't love me.

193
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:17,835
I've got to go.

194
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:24,107
Aunt Emma is here
and she plans to bake a cake.

195
00:24:24,476 --> 00:24:25,443
Märta.

196
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:26,738
Yes, Tomas.

197
00:24:26,845 --> 00:24:29,439
What if Mr. Persson doesn't return?

198
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:34,144
Then you can get some rest...
and read my letter.

199
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:35,720
You don't understand.

200
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:37,379
Here's the coffee.

201
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:41,658
Now what?

202
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,457
Poor Tomas.
I really mean it.

203
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:48,497
I'm not being very nice to you.
- You don't say.

204
00:24:51,103 --> 00:24:53,401
You're impossible sometimes.

205
00:24:53,505 --> 00:24:56,804
"God's silence.
God won't speak."

206
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,476
God has never spoken
because God doesn't exist.

207
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:01,375
It's as simple as that.

208
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,411
Now you'll get the flu.

209
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:10,745
That's fine,
seeing as it's a gift from you.

210
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:15,760
Would you like me to stay?
- No, that won't be necessary.

211
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,657
You have a lot to learn.

212
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:23,633
Says the schoolmarm.

213
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:25,600
You must learn to love.

214
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:27,735
And you can teach me that?

215
00:25:31,477 --> 00:25:33,100
I can't.

216
00:25:34,713 --> 00:25:37,204
That's not in my power.

217
00:26:01,673 --> 00:26:03,470
He has to show up.

218
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:56,218
My love.

219
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:34,419
"We find it difficult
to talk to each other.

220
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,755
We're both rather shy,

221
00:28:38,463 --> 00:28:41,910
and I tend to retreat into sarcasm."

222
00:28:41,733 --> 00:28:43,428
That's why I'm writing.

223
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:47,395
I have something important to say.

224
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:52,467
Do you remember last summer,

225
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:55,611
when that awful rash
broke out on my hands?

226
00:28:57,282 --> 00:29:01,218
One evening we were in church
arranging flowers on the altar,

227
00:29:01,787 --> 00:29:03,687
preparing for a confirmation.

228
00:29:05,724 --> 00:29:08,900
Do you recall
what bad shape I was in?

229
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:12,186
My hands all bandaged,
and itching so much I couldn't sleep?

230
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:17,229
The skin had flaked off,
and my palms were like open sores.

231
00:29:19,504 --> 00:29:23,634
We busied ourselves with daisies
and cornflowers, or whatever they were,

232
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:26,476
and I was feeling irritable.

233
00:29:27,946 --> 00:29:31,473
Suddenly I got mad at you
and challenged you angrily,

234
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:36,114
asking if you actually believed
in the power of prayer.

235
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,286
You replied that you did.

236
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:44,128
In a nasty tone I asked if you
had prayed for my hands,

237
00:29:44,563 --> 00:29:48,294
but it hadn't occurred
to you to do so.

238
00:29:49,735 --> 00:29:53,831
I melodramatically demanded
that you do it then and there.

239
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,938
Oddly enough, you agreed.

240
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,978
Your compliance enraged me,
and I tore off the bandages.

241
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,742
You remember the rest.

242
00:30:06,651 --> 00:30:10,417
The sight of those open sores
affected you greatly.

243
00:30:11,356 --> 00:30:13,510
You couldn't pray.

244
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:15,850
The entire situation disgusted you.

245
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,464
I came to understand you later,

246
00:30:23,802 --> 00:30:26,293
but you never understood me.

247
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:32,335
We had lived together
for some time at that point.

248
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:35,440
Almost two years...

249
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:41,148
which at least represented some capital
in the face of our emotional poverty.

250
00:30:41,787 --> 00:30:43,516
Our caresses...

251
00:30:44,923 --> 00:30:48,689
and our clumsy attempts
to evade the lack of love between us.

252
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:59,660
When the rash spread
to my forehead and scalp...

253
00:31:01,573 --> 00:31:04,337
I soon noticed
how you avoided me.

254
00:31:05,377 --> 00:31:07,345
You found me repugnant...

255
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:12,730
though you tried
to spare my feelings.

256
00:31:15,454 --> 00:31:18,252
Then the rash spread
to my hands and feet.

257
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:22,654
And our relationship ended.

258
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,261
That came as a shock to me.

259
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,196
I had to face the fact...

260
00:31:34,606 --> 00:31:36,733
that we didn't love each other.

261
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:42,309
There was no way to hide from that fact
or turn a blind eye to it.

262
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:51,884
Tomas...

263
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,255
I have never believed in your faith.

264
00:31:58,897 --> 00:32:04,130
Mainly because I've never been
tortured by religious tribulations.

265
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,597
My non-Christian family
was characterized by warmth,

266
00:32:08,707 --> 00:32:10,504
togetherness and joy.

267
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:15,712
God and Jesus
existed only as vague notions.

268
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:22,820
To me your faith seems
obscure and neurotic,

269
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:26,620
somehow cruelly overwrought
with emotion, primitive.

270
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,391
One thing in particular
I've never been able to fathom:

271
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:37,998
Your peculiar indifference
toJesus Christ.

272
00:32:45,343 --> 00:32:49,109
And now I'm going to tell you
about answered prayers.

273
00:32:49,848 --> 00:32:51,839
Laugh if you feel like it.

274
00:32:53,118 --> 00:32:55,848
Personally, I don't believe
the two are connected.

275
00:32:56,354 --> 00:32:58,345
Life is messy enough

276
00:32:58,823 --> 00:33:01,417
without taking the supernatural
into account.

277
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,680
You were going to pray
for my weeping hands,

278
00:33:11,436 --> 00:33:13,996
but the rash left you
dumbstruck with repulsion,

279
00:33:14,573 --> 00:33:16,564
something you later denied.

280
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:21,573
I went berserk
and tried to provoke you.

281
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:24,578
Be quiet!

282
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:29,318
Since you can't pray for me,
I'll do it myself!

283
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,520
God, why have you created me
so eternally dissatisfied?

284
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:41,792
So frightened, so bitter?

285
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:45,258
Why must I realize
how wretched I am?

286
00:33:45,904 --> 00:33:49,362
Why must I suffer
so hellishly for my insignificance?

287
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:55,410
If there is a purpose
to my suffering, then tell me,

288
00:33:55,413 --> 00:33:57,813
so I can bear my pain
without complaint.

289
00:33:58,817 --> 00:34:00,341
I'm strong.

290
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:05,219
You made me so very strong
in both body and soul...

291
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:09,984
but you never give me
a task worthy of my strength.

292
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,900
Give my life meaning,

293
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:19,233
and I'll be your obedient slave.

294
00:34:20,572 --> 00:34:23,632
This autumn I realized
that my prayers had been answered.

295
00:34:25,577 --> 00:34:28,171
I prayed for clarity of mind,
and I got it.

296
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:31,707
I realized that I love you.

297
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,284
I prayed for a task
to apply my strength to,

298
00:34:36,788 --> 00:34:38,449
and I received one.

299
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,753
That task is you.

300
00:34:44,763 --> 00:34:48,392
This is what the thoughts
of a schoolmarm might run to

301
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,697
when the phone refuses to ring,
when it's dark and lonely.

302
00:34:59,878 --> 00:35:03,609
What I lack entirely
is the capacity to show you my love.

303
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:06,106
I haven't a clue how to do that.

304
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:11,512
I've been so miserable,
I've even considered praying some more.

305
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:16,622
But I still have a shred
of self-respect left in spite of it all.

306
00:35:23,435 --> 00:35:25,232
My dearest Tomas...

307
00:35:27,972 --> 00:35:30,990
this turned out to be a long letter.

308
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:36,273
But now I've put down in writing
what I never dared say

309
00:35:36,915 --> 00:35:38,815
when you were in my arms.

310
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,440
I love you.

311
00:35:46,224 --> 00:35:47,851
And I live for you.

312
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:51,485
Take me and use me.

313
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,932
Beneath all my false pride
and independent airs,

314
00:35:57,569 --> 00:35:59,127
I have only one wish:

315
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:02,840
To be allowed to live
for someone else.

316
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:06,407
It's so terribly difficult.

317
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:14,475
When I think about it,

318
00:36:14,586 --> 00:36:17,200
I can't see
how I will be able to pull it off.

319
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:19,616
Maybe it's all just a mistake.

320
00:36:22,594 --> 00:36:26,792
Tell me I'm not wrong, darling.

321
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:18,378
I'm so glad you came.
It's been a long wait.

322
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:20,450
I'm sorry I'm late.

323
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:22,884
I didn't mean it as a reproach.

324
00:37:23,721 --> 00:37:27,851
Please, take your coat off.
I've got some nice hot coffee.

325
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:29,358
No, thank you.

326
00:37:38,236 --> 00:37:40,830
I don't expect you spend
much time at sea this time of year?

327
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:44,565
We just take
short fishing trips, that's all.

328
00:37:45,243 --> 00:37:46,835
Plenty to do ashore?

329
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:51,678
Yes, I'm building a new boat
over at Toernstroem's yard.

330
00:37:51,783 --> 00:37:53,683
An excellent establishment.

331
00:37:53,785 --> 00:37:56,150
I had my own boat built there,

332
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,883
at Toernstroem's yard.

333
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:02,883
Do you have money worries?

334
00:38:04,262 --> 00:38:07,197
Forgive me for asking, but things
like that can drive a man to despair.

335
00:38:07,298 --> 00:38:09,698
That's true.

336
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:16,272
How long have you considered
taking your own life?

337
00:38:17,308 --> 00:38:19,139
I'm not sure.

338
00:38:20,712 --> 00:38:22,145
A long time.

339
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:25,482
Have you spoken to a doctor?

340
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:27,981
I mean, are you in good health?

341
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,553
As far as I know.

342
00:38:30,355 --> 00:38:32,619
It's not unusual to... -

343
00:38:36,661 --> 00:38:39,255
Do you get along with your wife?

344
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:42,822
Karin's all right. She's all right.

345
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:47,633
So it all boils down
to this business about China.

346
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:55,741
Listen, Jonas.

347
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:57,678
I'm going to be frank with you.

348
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:02,312
You know my wife died
four years ago.

349
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,717
I loved her.

350
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,652
My life was over.

351
00:39:09,494 --> 00:39:11,291
I'm not afraid to die,

352
00:39:11,429 --> 00:39:14,570
and there was no reason
for me to hang on.

353
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,493
But I did.

354
00:39:18,503 --> 00:39:22,980
Not for my own sake,
but to be of some use.

355
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,402
I had great dreams once.

356
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,207
I was going to make
my mark on the world.

357
00:39:31,115 --> 00:39:33,140
The sort of ideas you have
when you're young.

358
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:36,615
I knew nothing of evil or cruelty.

359
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,615
When I was ordained,
I was as innocent as a baby.

360
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,221
Then everything happened at once.

361
00:39:46,664 --> 00:39:49,155
I was a seaman's pastor in Lisbon,

362
00:39:50,101 --> 00:39:52,228
during the Spanish Civil War.

363
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,465
I refused to see what was going on.

364
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,733
I refused to accept reality.

365
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:03,360
My God and I resided in an organized
world where everything made sense.

366
00:40:14,192 --> 00:40:16,920
You see,

367
00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:18,590
I'm no good as a clergyman.

368
00:40:18,563 --> 00:40:22,226
I put my faith in an improbable
and private image of a fatherly god.

369
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,267
One who loved mankind, of course,

370
00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:25,927
but me most of all.

371
00:40:29,874 --> 00:40:32,809
Do you see, Jonas,
what a monstrous mistake I made?

372
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:38,711
An ignorant, spoiled and anxious
wretch makes a rotten clergyman.

373
00:40:41,285 --> 00:40:45,850
Picture my prayers to an echo-god,

374
00:40:45,556 --> 00:40:48,150
who gave benign answers
and reassuring blessings.

375
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:53,195
Every time I confronted God
with the realities I witnessed,

376
00:40:54,565 --> 00:40:57,363
he turned into something
ugly and revolting.

377
00:40:58,236 --> 00:41:00,796
A spider God, a monster.

378
00:41:03,808 --> 00:41:06,402
So I sought to shield Him from life,

379
00:41:07,145 --> 00:41:09,477
clutching my image of Him
to myself in the dark.

380
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:13,979
The only person
I showed my god to was my wife.

381
00:41:15,586 --> 00:41:19,420
She supported me,
encouraged me and helped me.

382
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:22,886
Patched up the holes.

383
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:25,789
Our dreams.

384
00:41:26,998 --> 00:41:28,431
I'd better be going.

385
00:41:30,168 --> 00:41:31,533
No, don't go.

386
00:41:31,636 --> 00:41:34,161
I want you to understand
why I talk so much about myself.

387
00:41:34,439 --> 00:41:39,206
So you realize what a wretch I am,
what a poor beggar... -

388
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:42,746
I must be going,
or Karin will be worried.

389
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:44,776
Please stay a little bit longer.

390
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:50,879
Let's have a nice, calm discussion.

391
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:57,494
Forgive me for talking
in such a confused manner,

392
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:00,854
but all this suddenly hit me.

393
00:42:09,574 --> 00:42:12,975
If there is no God,

394
00:42:14,312 --> 00:42:16,371
would it really make any difference?

395
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:21,875
Life would become understandable.

396
00:42:22,587 --> 00:42:24,770
What a relief.

397
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,320
And thus death would be
a snuffing out of life.

398
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,517
The dissolution of body and soul.

399
00:42:33,331 --> 00:42:36,391
Cruelty, loneliness and fear... -

400
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,400
all these things would be
straightforward and transparent.

401
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,332
Suffering is incomprehensible,
so it needs no explanation.

402
00:42:50,314 --> 00:42:52,430
There is no creator.

403
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:56,544
No sustainer of life.

404
00:42:59,957 --> 00:43:01,515
No design.

405
00:43:45,803 --> 00:43:47,168
God...

406
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:51,475
why have you forsaken me?

407
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:20,356
Now I'm free.

408
00:45:21,999 --> 00:45:23,489
Free at last.

409
00:45:37,848 --> 00:45:40,840
I had this fleeting hope

410
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:47,230
that everything wouldn't turn out
to be illusions, dreams and lies.

411
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,712
I have to get ready.

412
00:46:18,856 --> 00:46:20,881
The service at Frostnäs
starts at 3:00.

413
00:46:21,158 --> 00:46:22,921
I'm coming with you.

414
00:46:23,194 --> 00:46:24,286
No.

415
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:34,620
I saw your car, Pastor,
so I came over.

416
00:46:35,573 --> 00:46:38,440
Fredriksson's boys found him.

417
00:46:39,844 --> 00:46:41,709
Just down the hill.

418
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:45,538
It's Jonas Persson.

419
00:46:46,217 --> 00:46:49,744
He shot himself
in the head with his rifle.

420
00:46:51,155 --> 00:46:54,556
The police superintendent
is at the scene.

421
00:46:54,658 --> 00:46:57,240
The boys reported it immediately.

422
00:46:57,595 --> 00:47:02,123
I met them on my way here.
They were terrified.

423
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:11,484
Could you please guard the body
until the van arrives?

424
00:49:12,496 --> 00:49:13,986
Good-bye. Please call me.

425
00:52:37,201 --> 00:52:38,600
Good-bye, Tomas.

426
00:52:38,702 --> 00:52:41,500
Maybe we'll talk this week.
- Do you have any aspirin?

427
00:52:41,605 --> 00:52:44,960
- Sure, and cough syrup, too.
- That might be good.

428
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:45,539
Come in.

429
00:52:45,642 --> 00:52:47,610
But isn't your aunt visiting?

430
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:51,347
Wait in the schoolroom, then.
I'll just be a minute.

431
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:50,729
- Hello.
- Good day.

432
00:53:50,841 --> 00:53:53,503
Whose boy are you?
- The Strands'.

433
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,510
- How old are you?
- Ten.

434
00:53:55,946 --> 00:53:59,473
- What brings you here on a Sunday?
- I left something in my desk.

435
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,648
- What's the dog's name?
- Jim.

436
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:08,150
Is he yours?

437
00:54:08,258 --> 00:54:09,384
No.

438
00:54:10,894 --> 00:54:13,658
He must be your big brother's,
the one who'll be confirmed this year.

439
00:54:13,764 --> 00:54:15,197
Yes.

440
00:54:15,966 --> 00:54:17,490
Will you go
to confirmation class too?

441
00:54:17,601 --> 00:54:19,000
No.

442
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:21,667
Why not?

443
00:54:22,706 --> 00:54:23,832
I don't know.

444
00:54:25,242 --> 00:54:27,335
Does your brother find it boring?

445
00:54:27,444 --> 00:54:29,200
I don't know.

446
00:54:31,448 --> 00:54:32,938
Well, good-bye, then.

447
00:54:34,151 --> 00:54:35,413
Good-bye.

448
00:54:38,856 --> 00:54:41,723
Hello, Johan.
What brings you here?

449
00:54:41,825 --> 00:54:44,200
I left something in my desk.

450
00:54:44,461 --> 00:54:46,190
How's your brother Pelle?

451
00:54:46,296 --> 00:54:49,697
He's much better.
He got out of bed Friday.

452
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,462
He'll be back in school
by the middle of next week.

453
00:54:52,569 --> 00:54:54,469
Good. Give my love to your folks.

454
00:54:54,705 --> 00:54:56,263
Good-bye.

455
00:55:11,321 --> 00:55:14,586
Careful, that's hot.
It's really for gargling with.

456
00:55:15,292 --> 00:55:18,523
You dissolve
these tablets in hot water.

457
00:55:19,129 --> 00:55:21,689
Auntie gave them to me.
She swears by them.

458
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:23,496
No, thank you.

459
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,930
My aunt often suffers from sore throats
and these really help.

460
00:55:33,477 --> 00:55:37,573
Suit yourself.
Here's the aspirin.

461
00:55:38,615 --> 00:55:42,510
Would you like some cold water?
- That won't be necessary.

462
00:55:47,491 --> 00:55:49,391
You sound so unfriendly.

463
00:55:51,628 --> 00:55:52,993
Sometimes... -

464
00:55:55,198 --> 00:55:59,430
Sometimes you sound...
as if you hated me.

465
00:56:06,877 --> 00:56:11,644
Take the whole box if you like.
Auntie arrived well-stocked.

466
00:56:17,854 --> 00:56:20,379
Can't I come to Frostnäs with you?

467
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:23,484
I'm going to the Persson's place.

468
00:56:23,593 --> 00:56:25,185
I can wait in the car.

469
00:56:25,729 --> 00:56:28,197
I thought your aunt baked a cake.

470
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,968
I need some time on my own.

471
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,304
Are you trying to get rid of me?

472
00:56:45,415 --> 00:56:47,975
Don't do this right now.

473
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:49,746
I don't have the strength.

474
00:56:49,853 --> 00:56:51,980
Why do you want to get rid of me?

475
00:56:53,323 --> 00:56:56,781
My dear little Tomas,
you're getting old.

476
00:56:57,361 --> 00:57:01,127
You're dissatisfied with life,
but most of all with yourself.

477
00:57:01,631 --> 00:57:05,362
And here I am throwing myself
in your arms, clouding the issue.

478
00:57:13,844 --> 00:57:16,404
Or am I forcing it?
- You be the judge.

479
00:57:17,214 --> 00:57:20,741
You have your dreams,
and I pay no attention to them.

480
00:57:20,984 --> 00:57:23,179
At times I even despise them.

481
00:57:23,453 --> 00:57:25,216
I should have been kinder.

482
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:29,454
- Those are just trivialities.
- No, they're not.

483
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:31,459
You've been unlucky.

484
00:57:31,828 --> 00:57:35,320
I'm so very bossy.
Don't bother contradicting me.

485
00:57:35,432 --> 00:57:37,696
Could you just listen to me?

486
00:57:37,968 --> 00:57:40,163
Sorry, I'm doing all the talking.

487
00:57:44,608 --> 00:57:47,800
I feel humiliated by the gossip.

488
00:57:53,517 --> 00:57:56,418
No one used to pay
much attention to the pastor.

489
00:57:57,754 --> 00:58:00,746
He was simply a fixture,

490
00:58:01,725 --> 00:58:04,159
though no one knew exactly
what he was good for.

491
00:58:05,495 --> 00:58:07,793
Then the rumors began
about you and me.

492
00:58:07,898 --> 00:58:10,458
All that tittle-tattle.

493
00:58:11,568 --> 00:58:13,433
So that's your reason?

494
00:58:15,472 --> 00:58:17,599
You don't have to sneer at me.

495
00:58:19,276 --> 00:58:20,675
Marry me, then.

496
00:58:25,982 --> 00:58:27,210
No.

497
00:58:27,818 --> 00:58:31,447
It's hard to plead one's own cause.

498
00:58:31,555 --> 00:58:33,682
Yes, it certainly is.

499
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:37,686
You can't...
You mustn't push me away.

500
00:58:38,428 --> 00:58:41,261
How can you be so blind?

501
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:43,525
Don't get hysterical.

502
00:58:43,633 --> 00:58:46,534
That's what you always say
whenever you see me crying.

503
00:58:48,271 --> 00:58:50,739
I suppose I am a tad hysterical.

504
00:58:50,841 --> 00:58:53,674
Calm down.
Don't alarm your aunt.

505
00:58:53,777 --> 00:58:56,905
I can't hold back the tears.

506
00:58:57,347 --> 00:59:01,408
Just go on talking.
I can still hear your every word.

507
00:59:14,931 --> 00:59:17,764
I thought I'd found a good excuse.

508
00:59:19,436 --> 00:59:21,563
All that stuff
about a pastor's reputation.

509
00:59:21,671 --> 00:59:23,901
But you didn't bite.

510
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:27,309
And I understand that,

511
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:29,508
since it was a pack of lies.

512
00:59:30,714 --> 00:59:33,120
The real reason

513
00:59:34,151 --> 00:59:36,210
is that I don't want you.

514
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,221
Did you hear that?

515
00:59:48,932 --> 00:59:50,399
Yes.

516
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:52,892
Of course I did.

517
01:00:00,143 --> 01:00:02,430
I'm tired of your loving care.

518
01:00:03,547 --> 01:00:04,912
Your fussing.

519
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:07,710
Your good advice.

520
01:00:09,486 --> 01:00:12,114
Your candlesticks and table runners.

521
01:00:14,157 --> 01:00:16,523
I'm fed up
with your shortsightedness.

522
01:00:17,861 --> 01:00:19,726
Your clumsy hands.

523
01:00:21,565 --> 01:00:23,260
Your anxiousness.

524
01:00:24,534 --> 01:00:27,940
Your timid displays of affection.

525
01:00:30,407 --> 01:00:34,366
You force me to occupy myself
with your physical condition.

526
01:00:35,378 --> 01:00:37,390
Your poor digestion.

527
01:00:37,514 --> 01:00:39,380
Your rashes.

528
01:00:39,716 --> 01:00:41,513
Your periods.

529
01:00:42,152 --> 01:00:43,619
Your frostbitten cheeks.

530
01:00:48,959 --> 01:00:53,896
Once and for all I have to escape
this junkyard of idiotic trivialities.

531
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,463
I'm sick and tired of it all,

532
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:02,650
of everything to do with you.

533
01:01:04,941 --> 01:01:07,466
Why didn't you tell me this before?

534
01:01:08,311 --> 01:01:10,438
Because of my upbringing.

535
01:01:12,282 --> 01:01:16,184
I was taught to regard women
as beings of a higher order.

536
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,120
Admirable creatures,

537
01:01:19,122 --> 01:01:21,147
unassailable martyrs.

538
01:01:24,394 --> 01:01:25,759
And your wife?

539
01:01:25,862 --> 01:01:27,295
I loved her.

540
01:01:28,131 --> 01:01:30,725
You hear me? I loved her.

541
01:01:32,702 --> 01:01:35,330
And I don't love you,
because I love my wife.

542
01:01:36,206 --> 01:01:38,436
When she died, so did I.

543
01:01:38,541 --> 01:01:41,601
I couldn't care less
what happens to me.

544
01:01:46,182 --> 01:01:47,945
Am I making myself clear?

545
01:01:48,985 --> 01:01:52,477
I loved her, and she was everything
you could never be

546
01:01:52,589 --> 01:01:54,352
but insist on trying to be.

547
01:01:55,725 --> 01:01:58,216
The way you mimic her behavior
is such an ugly parody.

548
01:02:01,865 --> 01:02:03,492
I didn't even know her.

549
01:02:13,243 --> 01:02:14,801
I'd better be going...

550
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:19,880
before I spout even worse bits
of senseless drivel.

551
01:02:21,251 --> 01:02:23,549
Could it get any worse?

552
01:02:41,438 --> 01:02:43,235
Stop rubbing your eyes like that.

553
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:47,437
Sorry.

554
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,650
Stare all you like.

555
01:02:55,952 --> 01:02:57,419
I can take it.

556
01:02:58,755 --> 01:03:01,724
I can barely see you
without my glasses.

557
01:03:05,462 --> 01:03:07,555
You're all fuzzy,

558
01:03:08,865 --> 01:03:11,356
and your face is just a white blob.

559
01:03:13,336 --> 01:03:15,531
You're not really real.

560
01:03:21,878 --> 01:03:26,178
Yes, I see that I did it all wrong

561
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:29,770
from the beginning.

562
01:03:29,786 --> 01:03:33,850
I've got to go.
I have to talk to Mrs. Persson.

563
01:03:34,624 --> 01:03:36,387
Every time I've hated you,

564
01:03:37,127 --> 01:03:40,620
I've made an effort
to turn it into compassion.

565
01:03:41,431 --> 01:03:43,194
You can't make it on your own.

566
01:03:43,967 --> 01:03:46,162
You won't survive, Tomas dear.

567
01:03:48,204 --> 01:03:50,468
Nothing can save you.

568
01:03:52,776 --> 01:03:54,767
You'll hate yourself to death.

569
01:03:56,279 --> 01:03:59,146
Can't you be quiet?
Can't you leave me alone?

570
01:03:59,616 --> 01:04:01,345
Can't you just shut up?

571
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,183
Would you like to come along?

572
01:04:36,152 --> 01:04:38,170
Do you really want me to?

573
01:04:39,155 --> 01:04:41,680
Or is that fear talking?

574
01:04:42,792 --> 01:04:46,125
Suit yourself.
But I'm asking you to come.

575
01:04:48,264 --> 01:04:50,960
Of course I'll come.

576
01:04:51,534 --> 01:04:53,468
I don't have much choice, do I?

577
01:04:59,876 --> 01:05:04,745
Auntie, I'll be back by 6:00.

578
01:05:05,815 --> 01:05:09,512
She must be asleep.
I'll just go check the stove.

579
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:02,540
Your husband is dead, Mrs. Persson.

580
01:07:02,865 --> 01:07:07,165
They've taken him to the infirmary,
but there's no hope.

581
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:09,300
He shot himself.

582
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:49,505
So, I'm all alone.

583
01:07:51,781 --> 01:07:53,544
Shall we read
from the Bible together?

584
01:07:54,617 --> 01:07:55,777
No.

585
01:07:56,986 --> 01:07:58,453
No, thank you.

586
01:08:04,494 --> 01:08:06,485
I've got to let the children know.

587
01:08:15,505 --> 01:08:18,963
I'll be in all evening,
if there's anything I can do for you.

588
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:24,377
I'll come by sometime this week
to make funeral arrangements.

589
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:30,420
I spoke to him,
but there was so little I could do.

590
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,318
I'm sure you did what you could, sir.

591
01:09:56,706 --> 01:09:59,174
It was my parents' dream
that I become a clergyman.

592
01:11:29,532 --> 01:11:30,965
Hello there.

593
01:11:31,670 --> 01:11:34,434
Those bells rang
for 20 seconds too long.

594
01:11:34,537 --> 01:11:39,406
Unfortunately, I was busy
replacing the candles.

595
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:42,972
I usually turn on the bells,
light the candles,

596
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:45,470
and make it back in time.

597
01:11:45,314 --> 01:11:48,613
But today I bungled it.
An unfortunate mishap.

598
01:11:49,452 --> 01:11:52,478
But those candles
were tricky to light.

599
01:11:52,588 --> 01:11:54,419
Probably a factory defect.

600
01:11:54,523 --> 01:11:57,424
And I guess
my broken-down body

601
01:11:57,526 --> 01:12:01,189
is slowing down my actions.

602
01:12:01,664 --> 01:12:03,723
The reason hardly matters.

603
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:08,600
I leave the temple in semidarkness
until just before the bells start.

604
01:12:08,905 --> 01:12:12,341
I believe electric lights disturb
our spirit of reverence.

605
01:12:13,109 --> 01:12:15,543
Don't you agree, Miss Lundberg?

606
01:12:19,749 --> 01:12:21,717
You asked to have a word with me.

607
01:12:21,817 --> 01:12:25,480
Yes, about a rather urgent matter.

608
01:12:29,158 --> 01:12:33,754
Once, when I complained about
my pains keeping me up nights,

609
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:37,300
you suggested that I read... -

610
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:38,357
I remember.

611
01:12:38,467 --> 01:12:40,594
To distract myself.

612
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:44,380
I began with the gospels.

613
01:12:45,374 --> 01:12:48,207
And real sleeping potions
they were too, if I may say so,

614
01:12:49,145 --> 01:12:51,790
at least now and then.

615
01:12:54,216 --> 01:12:57,310
Now I've got as far
as the story of Christ's passion,

616
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:00,860
and it's given me pause.

617
01:13:00,523 --> 01:13:05,756
So I figured I'd discuss it with you,
Pastor Ericsson.

618
01:13:07,229 --> 01:13:08,992
I feel compelled to do so.

619
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:13,535
The passion of Christ, his suffering.

620
01:13:14,904 --> 01:13:19,204
Wouldn't you say the focus
on his suffering is all wrong?

621
01:13:20,376 --> 01:13:21,843
What do you mean?

622
01:13:22,345 --> 01:13:25,712
This emphasis on physical pain.

623
01:13:26,248 --> 01:13:28,682
It couldn't have been all that bad.

624
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:31,719
It may sound presumptuous of me,

625
01:13:31,821 --> 01:13:33,686
but in my humble way,

626
01:13:33,789 --> 01:13:38,726
I've suffered as much
physical pain as Jesus.

627
01:13:40,162 --> 01:13:42,960
And his torments were rather brief.

628
01:13:43,532 --> 01:13:46,126
Lasting some four hours, I gather?

629
01:13:49,305 --> 01:13:53,742
I feel he was tormented
far worse on another level.

630
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:58,309
Maybe I've got it all wrong.

631
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:03,500
But just think
of Gethsemane, Pastor.

632
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:06,386
Christ's disciples fell asleep.

633
01:14:07,230 --> 01:14:12,510
They hadn't understood the meaning
of the last supper or anything.

634
01:14:13,796 --> 01:14:16,765
And when the servants of the law
appeared, they ran away,

635
01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:19,900
and Peter denied him.

636
01:14:21,203 --> 01:14:25,299
Christ had known
his disciples for three years.

637
01:14:26,575 --> 01:14:29,169
They'd lived together
day in and day out,

638
01:14:29,645 --> 01:14:32,375
but they never grasped
what he meant.

639
01:14:34,717 --> 01:14:37,811
They abandoned him,
down to the last man.

640
01:14:38,554 --> 01:14:40,579
He was left all alone.

641
01:14:42,658 --> 01:14:45,252
That must have been painful.

642
01:14:45,828 --> 01:14:48,558
To realize that no one understands.

643
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:53,891
To be abandoned
when you need someone to rely on.

644
01:14:55,838 --> 01:14:58,238
That must be
excruciatingly painful.

645
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:07,572
But the worst was yet to come.

646
01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:12,715
When Jesus was nailed to the cross,

647
01:15:12,822 --> 01:15:16,952
and hung there in torment,
he cried out,

648
01:15:17,726 --> 01:15:19,853
"God, my God.

649
01:15:20,329 --> 01:15:23,230
Why hast thou forsaken me?"

650
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,535
He cried out as loud as he could.

651
01:15:29,138 --> 01:15:32,369
He thought that his heavenly father
had abandoned him.

652
01:15:33,742 --> 01:15:36,939
He believed everything
he'd ever preached was a lie.

653
01:15:39,248 --> 01:15:44,151
In the moments before he died,
Christ was seized by doubt.

654
01:15:46,255 --> 01:15:50,351
Surely that must have been
his greatest hardship?

655
01:15:52,595 --> 01:15:54,790
God's silence.

656
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,363
Yes.

657
01:16:10,212 --> 01:16:13,579
No service today.
Not a soul turned up.

658
01:16:14,683 --> 01:16:16,173
You don't count.

659
01:16:16,352 --> 01:16:19,412
You belong, so to speak,
in the sheep pen.

660
01:16:21,857 --> 01:16:23,415
So, how are you doing?

661
01:16:25,628 --> 01:16:30,361
That pastor you're running after
isn't worth much.

662
01:16:30,466 --> 01:16:32,240
Don't deny it.

663
01:16:32,234 --> 01:16:34,566
You don't think
a spinster can be choosy.

664
01:16:36,906 --> 01:16:40,307
Märta, for your own sake,

665
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:44,141
you can leave this place,
so get out as quickly as you can.

666
01:16:44,947 --> 01:16:48,474
Everything at Mittsunda and Frostnäs
is in the grip of death and decay.

667
01:16:48,984 --> 01:16:50,542
Take me, for instance.

668
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:56,546
Remember when I used
to arrange musical soirees

669
01:16:56,792 --> 01:16:58,692
on that pile of junk upstairs?

670
01:16:58,861 --> 01:17:00,658
I gave concerts.

671
01:17:02,565 --> 01:17:04,590
And the things Tomas achieved.

672
01:17:05,634 --> 01:17:07,795
People actually attended church.

673
01:17:09,305 --> 01:17:12,297
But his wife was his undoing.

674
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,535
That got your attention, didn't it?

675
01:17:19,348 --> 01:17:20,747
The little woman.

676
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:25,130
My old galoshes knew human nature
better than Tomas did.

677
01:17:25,321 --> 01:17:28,170
He only had eyes for her.

678
01:17:28,591 --> 01:17:30,616
He was utterly smitten.

679
01:17:33,929 --> 01:17:37,729
So much for their love story.

680
01:17:39,735 --> 01:17:41,999
"God is love

681
01:17:42,104 --> 01:17:43,867
and love is God.

682
01:17:44,707 --> 01:17:47,938
Love proves the existence of God.

683
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:52,241
Love is a real force for mankind."

684
01:17:53,249 --> 01:17:55,240
You see, I know the drill.

685
01:17:55,684 --> 01:17:58,881
I've been an attentive listener
to the pastor's outpourings.

686
01:18:01,123 --> 01:18:03,751
Bye-bye, you old turtledove.

687
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:09,887
Get out while you can.

688
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:28,140
Hello, you tubercular old wheezer.
Don't pass your flu on to me.

689
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:30,847
Will there be a service?

690
01:18:30,953 --> 01:18:32,386
I don't feel well.

691
01:18:32,488 --> 01:18:34,800
I can see that.

692
01:18:34,189 --> 01:18:37,352
Florence Nightingale is out there,
waiting to minister to your needs.

693
01:18:38,427 --> 01:18:42,295
Personally,
I'd like to get some shut-eye.

694
01:18:42,698 --> 01:18:45,462
I'm playing tonight
at the Masonic Lodge, you see.

695
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:47,525
What's your opinion, Algot?

696
01:18:47,636 --> 01:18:48,694
Don't have one.

697
01:18:48,804 --> 01:18:50,704
I should have known.

698
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:53,435
I'll go upstairs to the organ.

699
01:18:53,542 --> 01:18:56,136
Algot can give me a sign
when the bells stop ringing.

700
01:19:00,749 --> 01:19:01,738
Well?

701
01:19:03,652 --> 01:19:06,177
There's only Miss Lundberg out there.

702
01:19:06,655 --> 01:19:08,714
Guess I shouldn't say "only."

703
01:19:09,725 --> 01:19:11,659
It's time to start the service bell.

704
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,593
That usually brings them in.

705
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:42,216
If only we could feel safe

706
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:46,192
and dare show
each other tenderness.

707
01:19:49,932 --> 01:19:52,696
If only we had
some truth to believe in.

708
01:19:54,103 --> 01:19:56,162
<i>If only we could believe.</i>

709
01:20:12,688 --> 01:20:15,156
Shall we have the service, then?

710
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:25,221
Holy, holy, holy
is the Lord of Hosts.

711
01:21:27,129 --> 01:21:30,292
The whole earth
is full of His glory.
