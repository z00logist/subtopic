

3
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,578
<i>Sometimes I stand looking at my wife</i>

4
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,505
<i>without her knowing I'm there.</i>

5
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:00,845
<i>The first time she entered this room
she said,</i>

6
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,548
<i>"Oh, how nice. I feel at home here."</i>

7
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,848
<i>We hadn't known each other long.</i>

8
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,521
We met at a bishops' conference
in Trondheim.

9
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,600
She was there as a journalist.

10
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:19,197
I told her about the parsonage out here.

11
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:25,370
I ventured to suggest a visit
when the conference was over.

12
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,326
On the way, I asked her to marry me.

13
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,336
She didn't answer,

14
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:39,168
but, when we entered the room, she said,

15
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,302
"Oh, how nice. I feel at home here."

16
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,811
Since then we've lived a quiet,
happy life at the parsonage.

17
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,723
Eva has, of course,
told me about her earlier life.

18
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:59,067
After finishing school,
she went on to college,

19
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:04,572
got engaged to a doctor
and lived with him for several years.

20
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,534
She wrote two small books...

21
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:14,419
came down with tuberculosis,
broke off the engagement

22
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:18,589
and moved from Oslo
to a small town in the south of Norway

23
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,210
where she began to work as a journalist.

24
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,765
This is the first of her books.
I like it so much.

25
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,267
She has written...

26
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,813
"One must learn to live.

27
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,563
I practice every day.

28
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:41,896
My biggest obstacle is
I don't know who I am.

29
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,777
I grope blindly.

30
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,527
If anyone ever loves me as I am,

31
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,035
I may dare at last to look at myself.

32
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,120
For me,
that possibility is fairly remote."

33
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,261
I'd like to tell her just once

34
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:10,099
that she is loved wholeheartedly...

35
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:15,647
but I can't say it in a way
that she'd believe.

36
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,524
I can't find the right words.

37
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,630
I've written to Mama. Am I interrupting?

38
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,760
No, no. Come in.

39
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,765
- I'll turn off the radio.
- I can come back later.

40
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,142
No, please read me the letter.

41
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,224
"Dearest Mama,

42
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,856
I was in town yesterday
and ran into Agnes,

43
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:06,860
who was visiting her parents.

44
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,325
She told me Leonardo had died.

45
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:15,699
I know what a terrible blow
this must be to you.

46
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:21,709
I was wondering if you'd like to
come visit us for a few days or weeks.

47
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,880
Please don't say no right away.

48
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:29,133
The parsonage is very spacious.

49
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,556
You'll have your own room
with all the conveniences.

50
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:37,262
We have a piano,
and you can practice all you want to.

51
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,564
It would make a change from a hotel.

52
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,434
Please say you'll come.

53
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:47,772
We'll make a fuss over you and spoil you.

54
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:53,078
It's been ages since we saw each other,
seven years this October.

55
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,323
Much love from Viktor and Eva."

56
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,159
- That's fine.
- Are you sure?

57
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,468
- Mama, darling!
- Eva! Well, here I am.

58
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:03,352
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Yes, just imagine.

59
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,309
- It was a long trip.
- Yes, I know.

60
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,396
It's beautiful here.

61
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,028
- I hope you'll stay a long time.
- Indeed I will.

62
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:18,284
- I can't believe you're here.
- Let's go for a nice long walk.

63
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:21,787
What heavy bags.
Have you brought all your music?

64
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,745
- Yes, I'm staying for good.
- That would be nice.

65
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,458
- You'll give me some lessons, won't you?
- Yes.

66
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,089
- Where's Viktor?
- He's not home at the moment.

67
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,842
We didn't think you'd arrive so early.

68
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,307
- This is your room.
- It's lovely.

69
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:44,689
- And what a beautiful view.
- The bathroom's here.

70
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,519
- How nice and modern.
- Thank you.

71
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:54,111
- I hope one wardrobe is enough.
- Everything's fine.

72
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,987
I really am very tired.

73
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,034
My back hurts.

74
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,368
I sat with Leonardo
through his last day and night.

75
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,997
He was in bad pain.
They gave him shots every two hours.

76
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,998
Now and then he cried because it hurt.

77
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,174
He wasn't afraid of dying.

78
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,597
<i>Outside the hospital,
they were drilling and hammering.</i>

79
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:22,677
The sun was blazing down,
and there were no awnings.

80
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:28,395
We tried to get another room,
but many wards were closed for repairs.

81
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,108
Towards evening the noise stopped
and I could open the window.

82
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:38,318
The heat outside was like a wall,
and not a breath of wind.

83
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,162
In the evening the doctor came.

84
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,831
He's an old friend.

85
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,120
He said it wouldn't be long.

86
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,124
Leonardo would get a shot every half hour

87
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,835
so he could die without pain.

88
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,426
<i>Then the doctor left
and the ward nurse came in.</i>

89
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,427
<i>She said I should eat,
but I wasn't hungry.</i>

90
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,101
The smell was making me sick.

91
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,485
Leonardo dozed off...

92
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:19,609
then woke up and asked me
to leave the room.

93
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:25,164
He called the night nurse,
and she came in with a shot.

94
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,455
A minute or two later,
she came out and said...

95
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,461
Leonardo was dead.

96
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,639
I sat with him all night.

97
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,852
He had been my friend for 18 years.

98
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:51,933
We had lived together for 13
and had never had an angry word.

99
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,362
For two years, he had known he was ill,
and there was no hope.

100
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:02,444
As often as I could, I went to see him
at his villa near Naples.

101
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:09,909
He was kind and thoughtful
and happy about my success.

102
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:15,165
We talked and joked
and played chamber music.

103
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:21,804
He hardly ever spoke of his illness,
and he wouldn't have liked me to ask.

104
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,757
One day he gave me a long look...

105
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,053
then laughed and said...

106
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:15,517
"This time next year I'll be gone...

107
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,277
but I'll always be with you.

108
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,068
I'll always be thinking of you."

109
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:31,078
It was sweet of him to say so,
but he was apt to be rather theatrical.

110
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,910
I can't say I go around grieving.

111
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,423
Of course he left a gap,
but it's no good fretting.

112
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,593
Do you think I've changed much?

113
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,716
You're just the same.

114
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,889
I dye my hair of course.

115
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,855
Leonardo doesn't like gray hair.
Otherwise I'm the same, don't you think?

116
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,053
I bought this outfit in Zurich.

117
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,388
I wanted something comfortable
for the trip.

118
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:58,522
I saw it in a window, went in,
tried it on, and it fit perfectly.

119
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,523
It was so cheap.

120
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,730
- Don't you think it's nice?
- Yes, very.

121
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:06,909
Will you help me with this case?
My back's giving me hell.

122
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,529
Do you have a board
to put under the mattress?

123
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,080
I need a hard surface.

124
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,910
- We put one there yesterday.
- Wonderful.

125
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,499
Eva, dear, what is it?

126
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,753
Did I say something wrong?

127
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,881
I'm just so glad to see you.

128
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,639
Give me a nice big hug,
like you used to when you were little.

129
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,645
I've done nothing but talk about myself.

130
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,973
Tell me about you.

131
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,685
- How are things?
- Oh, fine.

132
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:44,271
Do you lead a very isolated life?

133
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,324
No, we have our parish work.

134
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,493
Yes, of course.

135
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,741
I often play the organ.

136
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,665
Last month I had a musical evening.

137
00:13:54,751 --> 00:14:00,088
I played and talked about each piece.

138
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:04,213
- I hope you'll play for me.
- I'd love to.

139
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:08,012
I gave five school concerts
in Los Angeles.

140
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,759
3,000 children each time.

141
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,057
I played and talked to them.

142
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,432
I was a huge success.

143
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,888
There's something I have to tell you.

144
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,770
Helena is here.

145
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,369
You should have told me.

146
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:37,291
If I had, you wouldn't have come.

147
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,619
I'm sure I would have.

148
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,624
And I'm sure you wouldn't have.

149
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,665
Isn't Leonardo's death enough?

150
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,089
Why drag poor Lena here too?

151
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,388
She's been here for the last two years.

152
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:56,260
Viktor and I asked her
if she'd like to live with us.

153
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,641
- I wrote to tell you.
- I never got the letter.

154
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,226
Or else you never bothered to read it.

155
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:09,148
- Aren't you being rather unfair?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

156
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,078
I'm not up to seeing her.
At any rate, not today.

157
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:20,292
Helena is a wonderful person.

158
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,828
She's longing to see you.

159
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,666
It seemed so nice for her at that home.

160
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,046
I wanted her with me.

161
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,878
Are you sure she's better off here?

162
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:34,761
Yes. And I have someone to look after.

163
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,343
Has she...

164
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,269
I mean is she...

165
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,019
Is she worse?

166
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,819
Oh, yes, she's worse.
It's part of the disease.

167
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,317
Come along then. Let's go and see her.

168
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,410
- Are you sure?
- I have no choice.

169
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,878
Some people are so naïve.

170
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,540
- You mean me?
- If the shoe fits.

171
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,465
Come on. Let's go.

172
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,607
Dear Lena!

173
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:32,315
I've thought of you so often, every day.

174
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,616
Helena is afraid of giving you her cold.

175
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:46,044
I haven't had a cold for 20 years.

176
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:51,133
What a lovely room you have,
and what a view.

177
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,176
I have the same view from my room.

178
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,276
Helena wants you
to take her head in your hands.

179
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,479
Like that?

180
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,276
I'm so glad Eva's looking after you.

181
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,784
I thought you were still at that home.

182
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,581
I would have come to visit.

183
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,035
But it's much better like this, isn't it?

184
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,204
Now we can be together every day.

185
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,292
Are you in pain?

186
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,675
No.

187
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,476
I love how you've done your hair.

188
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,896
It's in your honor.

189
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,691
Suppose I read aloud to you?
Would you like that?

190
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:03,952
And we can go for a drive.
I've never been around here before.

191
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,504
What?

192
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:14,584
Helena says you must be very tired
and not to exert yourself any more today.

193
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,678
Well done, Mama.

194
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,607
- Doesn't Lena have a wristwatch?
- Of course. It's on the nightstand.

195
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,942
I'll give you mine.

196
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,739
It was a gift from an admirer
who said I was always late.

197
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:42,118
- Will Lena be having dinner with us?
- No, she's on a diet.

198
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,700
She ate far too much at the hospital.

199
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,791
Why do I feel like I have a fever?

200
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,628
Why do I want to cry?

201
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:04,516
I'm to be put to shame. That's the idea.

202
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:09,020
A guilty conscience.
Always a guilty conscience!

203
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,984
I was in such a hurry to get here.
What was I expecting?

204
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:19,607
What was I longing for so desperately?

205
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,910
What an extraordinary mother.

206
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,623
You should have seen her
when I told her Lena was here.

207
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,826
She actually smiled.

208
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,333
Can you believe she actually
managed to produce a smile

209
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,960
despite her surprise and alarm?

210
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,377
Then, as we stood outside Lena's door,

211
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,632
she was like an actress
waiting for her entrance,

212
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,089
scared but in control.

213
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,550
The performance was superb.

214
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,804
Why on earth did she come here?

215
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,899
What did she expect would happen
after seven years?

216
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,271
- What did she expect?
- I wonder.

217
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,228
And what did I expect?

218
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,403
- We never give up hope, do we?
- I don't think so.

219
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,780
Don't we ever stop
being mother and daughter?

220
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,363
No use starting to cry.

221
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,489
Damn it!

222
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,703
There she sat,
gazing at me with her big eyes.

223
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:23,255
I held her face and felt the disease
twitching at her throat muscles.

224
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,798
Damn it!

225
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,053
To think I can't carry her to my bed

226
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,764
and comfort her as I did
when she was three.

227
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,657
That soft, torn body...

228
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,199
that's my Lena.

229
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,915
Don't cry, for Christ's sake.

230
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,293
A writer whose name I've forgotten said,

231
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:05,676
"It's like a ghost falling on top of you
when you open the door to the nursery

232
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:09,179
having long since forgotten
it is the nursery."

233
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,310
Do you think I'm an adult?

234
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:18,893
I guess being an adult is being able
to handle your dreams and hopes,

235
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,773
not longing for things.

236
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,904
Do you think so?

237
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,858
Maybe you stop being surprised.

238
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:31,239
You look so sensible with your old pipe.

239
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,240
You're very adult.

240
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:37,248
I don't know. I'm surprised every day.

241
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,830
- At what?
- At you.

242
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:44,965
And I have the most
unreasonable dreams and hopes.

243
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:48,138
And a longing too, come to that.

244
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,057
- A longing?
- Yes. I long for you.

245
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,477
Those are very pretty words.

246
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,271
Words don't mean anything real.

247
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,191
I was brought up with beautiful words.

248
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:05,322
Mama is never furious
or disappointed or unhappy.

249
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,319
She is "pained."

250
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,160
You have a lot of words like that too.

251
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,497
It's kind of an occupational disease.

252
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:19,374
If you long for me when I'm here,
I'll start getting suspicious.

253
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,547
- You know what I mean.
- No.

254
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:27,169
If I knew, it would never have entered
your head to say you long for me.

255
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:31,181
I have to check the veal roast.

256
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:35,222
Mama thinks I'm a hopeless cook.
She's a real glutton.

257
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,020
- I think you're a...
- ...wonderful cook.

258
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,143
Thank you.

259
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,440
And she's having decaffeinated coffee.

260
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,980
I'll cut my visit short.

261
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,566
I can manage four days.

262
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,074
Then I'll go to Africa
as I had originally planned.

263
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,831
This hurts, Charlotte.

264
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,329
It hurts, hurts, hurts.

265
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,504
I've often wondered why she sleeps badly.

266
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,302
Now I know.

267
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:13,974
If that woman slept normally,
her vitality would crush everyone.

268
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:19,438
Her insomnia is nature's way
of using up the surplus energy.

269
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:25,436
I'll put on my red dress
just to spite Eva.

270
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:29,944
I'm sure she thinks
I ought to be in mourning.

271
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,994
Watch how carefully
she dresses for dinner.

272
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:42,123
Her dress will be a discreet reminder
that she's a lonely widow.

273
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,831
I'm angry all the time.

274
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:50,010
Viktor and Eva have been sweet to me.

275
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,341
Viktor's a kind soul.

276
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,469
Lucky for Eva, the crybaby.

277
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,601
I'll bet the shower doesn't work.

278
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,849
Yes, it does.

279
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:18,447
- What a lovely dress!
- Does it suit me?

280
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,705
One day I met a friend who said,

281
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,208
"I've just come from a fashion show.

282
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,290
There was a divine red dress
that's absolutely you."

283
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,216
To your health, Charlotte.

284
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,715
We're delighted to have you with us.

285
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:06,120
Eva,
see if I left my glasses on the table.

286
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,675
Thank you, darling.

287
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,372
That was my agent. He's so sweet.

288
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,576
He's the only friend I have left.

289
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,537
You remember old Paul, Eva.

290
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,839
We've worked together for 30 years now.

291
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,630
What a fine old instrument.

292
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,259
What a lovely tone. And just tuned.

293
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,678
Now I'm really happy.

294
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:47,016
- I didn't need to worry.
- What do you mean, Mama?

295
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:51,271
I was nervous,
seeing you again after so many years.

296
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,647
I nearly didn't come.

297
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,524
No sugar, please.

298
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,779
This strange coffee is a bore,
but what can I do when I can't sleep?

299
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,574
I see you're working
on the Chopin preludes.

300
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,368
- Play something.
- Not now.

301
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,042
Don't be childish.

302
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,462
You'd give me great pleasure.

303
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:16,633
But you wanted your mother
to hear you play.

304
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:21,179
But it's all a sham. I have no technique.

305
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:26,351
I haven't even bothered
to learn the fingering.

306
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,895
Darling, no more excuses.
Come on, now, play.

307
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,886
Eva, my dearest.

308
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,183
- Is that all?
- I was just so moved.

309
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,012
- Did you like it?
- I liked you.

310
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:39,351
- I don't understand.
- Play something else.

311
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,107
- What was wrong with it?
- Nothing.

312
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,574
You didn't like my interpretation.

313
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,495
- We each have our own.
- Exactly.

314
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,492
I want to know yours.

315
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:56,451
- You're annoyed.
- No, I'm upset.

316
00:29:56,545 --> 00:30:00,414
You won't tell me
your interpretation of this prelude.

317
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,544
All right, if you insist.

318
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,762
Your technique wasn't bad at all,

319
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:11,637
though you might have taken
more interest in Cortot's fingering,

320
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:17,064
but let's just talk about the conception.

321
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:22,194
Chopin was emotional, but not sentimental.

322
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,363
Feeling is very far from sentimentality.

323
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:31,696
The prelude tells of pain, not reverie.

324
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:35,657
You have to be calm, clear and harsh.

325
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,743
Take the first bars now.

326
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,798
It hurts, but he doesn't show it.

327
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,377
Then a short relief.

328
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:57,563
But it evaporates immediately,
and the pain is the same.

329
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,227
Total restraint the whole time.

330
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:12,407
Chopin was proud, passionate,
tormented and very manly.

331
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,704
He wasn't a sentimental old woman.

332
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:18,916
This prelude must sound almost ugly.

333
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,621
It is never ingratiating.
It should sound wrong.

334
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:26,549
You have to battle your way through it
and emerge triumphant.

335
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,878
Like this.

336
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,459
I see.

337
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,417
Don't be annoyed with me.

338
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:14,501
Why would I be? On the contrary.

339
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:18,178
For 45 years,
I've worked at these terrible preludes.

340
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:22,767
They still contain a lot of secrets.

341
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,180
When I was little, I admired you so much.

342
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:31,275
Then I got pretty tired
of you and your pianos.

343
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,905
Now I admire you again,
but in a different way.

344
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,992
- Then there's some hope.
- Yes, I guess so.

345
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:58,048
- Where are you?
- I'm up here, Mama.

346
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:10,686
I've changed,
so we can go for a walk if you like.

347
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,230
- Is this the nursery?
- Yes, it's Erik's room.

348
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,656
Why would you keep it this way?

349
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:22,827
We've often talked about changing it.

350
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:28,329
Sometimes I come and sit here
and let my thoughts wander.

351
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,375
- Let's go.
- Wait, Mama.

352
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,121
Just feel how nice it is in here.

353
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:39,377
Erik drowned the day
before his fourth birthday.

354
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,386
But you know that.

355
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:46,100
It was too much for Viktor.

356
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:49,304
I grieved a lot, outwardly.

357
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:53,141
Deep inside,
I felt like he was still alive,

358
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,443
that we were living close to each other.

359
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:01,236
All I have to do is concentrate,
and he's there.

360
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:07,747
Sometimes, as I'm falling asleep
I can feel him breathing on my face

361
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,871
and touching me with his hand.

362
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,455
He's living another life,
but we can reach one another.

363
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,916
There's no dividing line,
no insurmountable wall.

364
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:25,515
I wonder what reality looks like
where my little boy is living.

365
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,684
I know it can't be described.

366
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,684
It's a world of liberated feelings.

367
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,437
Do you know what I mean?

368
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:42,316
To me, man is a tremendous creation,
an inconceivable thought.

369
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:47,120
In man, there is everything,
from the highest to the lowest.

370
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:51,495
Man is God's image,
and in God there is everything.

371
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,998
So human beings are created,

372
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,878
but also the demons and the saints,

373
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:03,211
the prophets and artists and iconoclasts.

374
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,341
Everything exists side by side.

375
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:09,847
It's like huge patterns
changing all the time.

376
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,643
Do you know what I mean?

377
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:16,600
In the same way,
there must also be countless realities.

378
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,485
Not only the reality
we perceive with our dull senses,

379
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:27,661
but a tumult of realities arching
above each other inside and outside.

380
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,997
It's just fear and priggishness
to believe in limits.

381
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,034
There are no limits.

382
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:39,919
Neither for thoughts nor for feelings.

383
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:46,596
It's anxiety that sets limits,
don't you think so?

384
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:51,927
When you play the slow movement
of the Hammerklavier sonata,

385
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:56,856
you must feel like you're living
in a world without limitations,

386
00:37:57,066 --> 00:38:02,357
in a movement
you can never see through or explore.

387
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,400
Let's go for a walk
before it gets too dark.

388
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,204
Yes.

389
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,348
I thought I heard Helena calling.

390
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,145
Excuse me.

391
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:43,649
I think Eva is terribly unhappy.

392
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:48,824
I'm appalled when I hear her rambling on.
It's so neurotic.

393
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,618
Just a moment, Charlotte,

394
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:56,495
and I'll try to explain how I see my wife.

395
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:03,961
When I asked Eva to marry me,
she said she didn't love me.

396
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,385
- What do you mean?
- I asked if she loved someone else.

397
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,799
She said she had never loved anyone,

398
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:16,219
that she was incapable of loving.

399
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:23,852
Eva and I lived here for several years.

400
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,772
Then Erik was born.

401
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:31,525
We'd given up hope of a child of our own

402
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,703
and had talked about adopting one.

403
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:40,786
With her pregnancy,
Eva underwent a complete change.

404
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:47,008
She became cheerful, gentle and outgoing.

405
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,552
She got lazy.

406
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:55,474
She lost interest in her parish work
and her piano playing.

407
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,893
She would sit by that window,

408
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:01,472
gazing at the play of light
over the mountains and fjords.

409
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,443
We were suddenly very happy.

410
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,819
I'm much older than Eva.

411
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:16,575
I felt as if a gray film
were settling over life.

412
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,953
I felt as if I could look back and say,

413
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:24,003
"Well, well, so that was my life.
That's how it all turned out."

414
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:34,471
But suddenly things were different.

415
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:44,561
Please forgive me,
but it's still rather hard to...

416
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:54,279
Yes.
We had some years that were very rich.

417
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,985
Erik.

418
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,909
You should have seen Eva.

419
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,618
You really should have seen her.

420
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:11,334
At the time of Erik's birth,
I was recording all the Mozart sonatas.

421
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:14,261
- I couldn't get one day off.
- No.

422
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:17,511
We invited you over and over again.

423
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:23,013
When Erik drowned,
that gray film got even grayer.

424
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,896
For Eva, it was different.

425
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:33,906
- Different?
- Her feeling lives on, uncorroded.

426
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,321
Or so it seems anyway.

427
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:45,043
If she feels that her son is alive
and near her...

428
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:49,209
well, perhaps that's how it is.

429
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,041
She seldom speaks of it.

430
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:57,343
I guess she's afraid it might upset me,
as indeed it would.

431
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:01,638
But what she says sounds true enough.

432
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,553
I believe her.

433
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,730
Yes, you're a minister.

434
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:11,360
The little faith I have
lives on her terms.

435
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,439
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

436
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,694
It doesn't matter.

437
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:20,528
Unlike you and Eva,
I'm confused and uncertain.

438
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,702
It's my own fault.

439
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:25,954
I think I'll take a nice dose
of sleeping pills tonight.

440
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:34,508
It's so peaceful here,
only the hiss of the rain on the roof.

441
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:38,713
- Do you have everything you need?
- Couldn't be better.

442
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:44,723
Cookies, mineral water, a tape recorder,
two detective novels,

443
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:49,682
my blindfold, earplugs,
my spare pillow and my travel blanket.

444
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,777
Would you like to taste my delicious
Swiss chocolate? Fresh from Zurich.

445
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,980
Help yourself. You can have two pieces.

446
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,611
I don't like chocolate.

447
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:02,695
I seem to remember you were crazy
about candy as a child.

448
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,573
Helena liked it. I didn't.

449
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,329
Good, all the more for me.

450
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,078
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, my pet.

451
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,256
Viktor is a wonderful person.

452
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,301
- You must take care of him.
- I do.

453
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:21,847
Eva, darling, are you happy together?

454
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,928
Do you get along?

455
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,850
Viktor is my best friend.

456
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,975
I can't imagine life without him.

457
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,395
He said you didn't love him.

458
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:34,901
- Did he say that?
- Yes.

459
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,480
- Why?
- Oh, it's just surprising.

460
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,865
Was it a secret?

461
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:46,455
- But he shouldn't have said it?
- He's not the confiding type.

462
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,908
We were talking about you.

463
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:53,245
If you want to know anything, ask me.
I'll tell you the truth.

464
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,082
Now, don't get upset.

465
00:43:56,175 --> 00:44:00,385
A mother naturally worries
about her daughter.

466
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:04,340
We spoke of you
with the greatest affection.

467
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,552
If only you'd leave people alone.

468
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,605
I've left you alone far too long.

469
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:15,442
- You're right.
- Give me a hug.

470
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,566
- Promise you're not angry.
- I'm not.

471
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,899
- I love you, don't you see?
- I love you too.

472
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:26,241
It's not much fun
being alone all the time.

473
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:29,331
I envy you and Viktor.

474
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:34,829
Now that Leonardo's dead, I'm so lonely.

475
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,249
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

476
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:42,052
I'll start weeping
with self-pity any minute.

477
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,173
This book isn't bad.

478
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:48,805
It's by Adam Kretzinsky.
Have you heard of him?

479
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:52,896
I met him in Madrid. He's mad as a hatter.

480
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:56,441
I couldn't defend myself.
In fact, I didn't.

481
00:44:57,278 --> 00:45:01,238
- Should I turn off this light?
- Yes, please.

482
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:06,239
- I'll bring you your breakfast.
- Don't trouble yourself.

483
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:10,164
- But I want to spoil you.
- Very well, if you insist.

484
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:16,083
Strong coffee, hot milk,
two slices of German bread with cheese,

485
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:20,041
one slice of toast with honey.

486
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:23,218
- And orange juice.
- I nearly forgot.

487
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,421
- I can...
- Juice it will be.

488
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:29,098
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Mama.

489
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,868
I think I'll have a look at my accounts.

490
00:45:56,671 --> 00:46:00,381
I'll have Brammer invest
the money from Leonardo.

491
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:05,253
The house is worth quite a bit too.

492
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:08,930
Leonardo,
you never looked after your money.

493
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,429
You were above mundane worries...

494
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,974
and left all these problems
to your Charlotte.

495
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:23,363
3,735,866 francs.

496
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:28,901
To think you had so much money.
Who'd have thought it?

497
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:35,116
And you left it all to your old Charlotte.

498
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:40,542
I've got a little nest egg too.

499
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:46,126
Together, it comes to over five million.

500
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:49,300
What am I going to do with so much money?

501
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:53,388
I'll buy a nice car for Viktor and Eva.

502
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:57,847
They can't drive around
in that old rattletrap.

503
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,229
On Monday we'll go into town
and look for a new car.

504
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:04,524
It'll cheer them up. Me too.

505
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:11,911
"She offered him the red flower
of her virginity.

506
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:15,410
He accepted it without enthusiasm."

507
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:21,420
This is trash.

508
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:26,341
Adam was really quite an idiot,

509
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:29,545
even if he did nearly
commit suicide because of me.

510
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:38,479
Supposing I buy a new car for myself
and give them the Mercedes?

511
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:45,110
Then I can fly to Paris
and buy a car there,

512
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:49,439
and I won't have to drive all that way.

513
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:53,111
Tomorrow, I have to work on Ravel.

514
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:59,834
It's disgraceful
how lazy I've been lately.

515
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,680
Mama, what happened?

516
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,931
I heard you call out,
and you weren't in your room.

517
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:09,236
I'm sorry I woke you,
but I had such a horrible dream.

518
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,067
I can't remember it.

519
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:15,697
- Do you want some company?
- No, thank you, dear.

520
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:20,701
- You go back to bed.
- Very well.

521
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:27,712
- You do like me, don't you?
- You're my mother.

522
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,382
That's one way of answering.

523
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:44,141
- Do you like me?
- I love you.

524
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,642
Do you?

525
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:51,195
I broke off my career
to stay at home with you and Papa.

526
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,651
Your back prevented you
from practicing six hours a day.

527
00:49:56,744 --> 00:50:00,784
Your playing got worse
and so did your reviews.

528
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:04,788
- Have you forgotten that?
- No, but Eva...

529
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:06,493
I don't know which I hated more,

530
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:10,297
when you were at home
or when you were on tour.

531
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:15,339
I realize now you made life hell
for Papa and me.

532
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,638
Eva, sweetheart, that's not true.
Your father and I were very happy.

533
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:21,967
Josef loved me,
and I'd have done anything for him.

534
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,018
Yes, of course.

535
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,647
- You were unfaithful to him.
- I was not!

536
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,983
I was quite honest with Josef.

537
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:34,738
I fell in love with Martin
and lived with him for eight months.

538
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,654
It wasn't a bed of roses.

539
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,908
I was the one who had to sit with Papa
in the evenings.

540
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,493
I was the one who had to comfort him,

541
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:48,372
to keep repeating
that you did love him just the same,

542
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,455
that you were sure to come back.

543
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,633
I read your letters out loud,

544
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:59,463
your long, loving, amusing letters

545
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:03,968
in which you told us
of your interesting travels.

546
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:11,563
We sat there like two idiots,
reading your letters over and over.

547
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:14,983
We thought you were
the most wonderful person alive.

548
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:20,325
You hate me.

549
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,289
I don't know.

550
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:31,996
I was so excited that you were coming.

551
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,456
I don't know what I was imagining.

552
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,009
Maybe I thought you were lonely and sad.

553
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,387
I'm so confused!

554
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:43,882
I thought I was an adult

555
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:49,722
and could look clearly at you and me
and Helena's illness and our childhood.

556
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:55,026
Now it's all one big mess.

557
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,687
Helena.

558
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:16,585
It's all right now.

559
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,213
Wake up. Wake up now.

560
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,090
There, there.

561
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:31,847
I'll sit here with you
until you go to sleep.

562
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,505
For you, I was just a doll you played with
when you had time.

563
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:48,800
If I was sick or naughty,
you handed me over to the nanny.

564
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:53,599
You shut yourself in and worked,

565
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,309
<i>and no one was allowed to disturb you.</i>

566
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:59,184
<i>I used to stand outside, listening.</i>

567
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:04,819
<i>When you stopped for coffee,
I'd go in to see ifyou really existed.</i>

568
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:09,820
<i>You were always kind,
but your mind was elsewhere.</i>

569
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,915
<i>If I spoke, you barely answered.</i>

570
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:17,001
Thank you.

571
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,016
Mama wants to be left alone now.

572
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,817
Run along and play outside.
It's such a lovely day.

573
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,545
I always wanted to be beautiful like you.

574
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:06,627
I always worried that you
wouldn't like the way I looked.

575
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,762
I was so ugly,

576
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:13,558
lean and angular with big cow's eyes,

577
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:17,763
<i>big wide lips and no eyebrows.</i>

578
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:22,146
<i>My arms were too thin and my feet too big.</i>

579
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,398
<i>I thought I looked repulsive.</i>

580
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,280
<i>Once you said,
"You should have been a boy,"</i>

581
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:34,245
<i>and laughed so I wouldn't be upset.</i>

582
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,867
<i>I was, of course.</i>

583
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:40,828
Then, one day,
your suitcases would be downstairs,

584
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:45,086
and you'd be talking on the phone
in a foreign language.

585
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:50,591
I used to pray that something
would stop you from leaving...

586
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,430
but you always went.

587
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:58,353
You'd hug me and kiss me,

588
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:01,146
then hug and kiss me again.

589
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,520
You'd look at me and smile.

590
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:07,358
You smelled nice but strange.

591
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:11,195
<i>You yourself were a stranger,
already on your way.</i>

592
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:13,242
<i>You didn't see me.</i>

593
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,320
<i>Then you'd be gone.</i>

594
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:20,750
<i>I used to think, "Now I'll die.</i>

595
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,793
<i>It hurts so much.</i>

596
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,962
<i>I'll never be happy again.</i>

597
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:30,173
<i>How can I bear this pain for two months?"</i>

598
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,806
And I'd cry in Papa's lap.

599
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:48,987
He'd sit very still
with his soft hand on my head.

600
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:54,993
He'd keep on sitting there,
smoking his old pipe.

601
00:56:55,996 --> 00:57:00,661
<i>Sometimes he'd say,
"Let's go to a movie this evening,"</i>

602
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:04,251
<i>or "What about ice cream
for dinner today?"</i>

603
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:09,499
<i>But I just wanted to die.</i>

604
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,844
So the days and weeks passed.

605
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,176
<i>We shared the loneliness very well.</i>

606
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:26,808
<i>We didn't have much to say,
but I never disturbed him.</i>

607
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,061
Sometimes he'd look worried.

608
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:34,115
I didn't know then
that he was always short of money.

609
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:39,663
But whenever I'd come clumping along,
his face would brighten,

610
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:44,038
and he'd pat me with his pale little hand.

611
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:50,128
Or else Uncle Otto would be sitting
on the sofa, drinking brandy.

612
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:53,714
<i>They'd mumble to each other.</i>

613
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,629
<i>I wonder if they could hear each other.</i>

614
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:01,718
Or else Uncle Harry would be there
and they'd play chess...

615
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,515
and then it'd be extra quiet.

616
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:11,607
I could hear
three different clocks ticking.

617
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,905
A few days before you were due home,

618
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:21,787
I'd get a fever from the excitement.

619
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:26,914
I'd worry I might really get sick,
because you were afraid of sick people.

620
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:35,048
When you did come,
I was so happy I couldn't say anything.

621
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:38,338
<i>You'd get impatient and say,</i>

622
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:42,426
<i>"Eva doesn't seem verypleased
to have her mother home again."</i>

623
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:48,686
<i>I'd blush red as a beet
and break out in a sweat.</i>

624
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,521
I couldn't say anything.

625
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:54,271
I had no words.

626
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:59,359
You had taken charge
of all the words in our home.

627
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:03,287
- You're exaggerating.
- I must finish speaking.

628
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:08,452
I know I'm tipsy, but otherwise
I wouldn't have said what I have.

629
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:14,633
When I'm too ashamed to say any more,
you can explain,

630
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:20,472
and I'll listen and understand,
just as I've always done.

631
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:27,262
I loved you, Mama.

632
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:31,937
As a matter of life and death.
But I distrusted your words.

633
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,854
They didn't match
the expression in your eyes.

634
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,314
You have a beautiful voice.

635
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:42,448
When I was little,
I could feel it all over my body.

636
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:46,911
But I knew instinctively
you didn't mean what you said.

637
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,832
I couldn't understand your words.

638
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:58,339
The most horrible thing was,
you'd smile when you were mad.

639
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,181
When you hated Papa, you'd call him,
"my dearest."

640
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:09,183
When you were tired of me, you'd say,
"darling little girl."

641
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,325
It's gotten quiet in here.

642
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,833
What can I say?

643
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:34,704
Defend yourself.

644
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,210
Is it worth the effort?

645
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,004
How would I know?

646
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:44,339
You reproach me for leaving,
and you reproach me for staying home.

647
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:49,890
I had a hell of a time those years.

648
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,648
My back hurt. I couldn't practice.

649
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:57,898
Important engagements were canceled.

650
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,980
My life seemed meaningless.

651
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:06,286
I felt guilty about always being away
from you and Papa.

652
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,572
You're smiling sarcastically.

653
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:12,371
I'm trying to tell you the truth.

654
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:16,044
I'm merely telling you how I felt.

655
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:20,334
We may as well have this out for once.
Then we won't refer to it again.

656
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:25,388
Go on.

657
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:34,181
I was in Hamburg,
playing Beethoven's First.

658
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:38,143
It's not too difficult,
and everything had gone well.

659
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,145
After the concert, Schmiess and I...

660
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,731
You know, the conductor. He's dead now.

661
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:47,489
We went to get a bite to eat.
We always did.

662
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:50,196
After we'd been eating
and drinking for a while,

663
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:55,331
and I was content and relaxed
and my back wasn't aching,

664
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,207
Schmiess said...

665
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:03,418
"Why don't you stay at home
with your husband and child

666
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:06,219
and lead a respectable life,

667
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:10,808
instead of exposing yourself
to constant humiliation?"

668
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:21,274
I stared at him and laughed and said,
"Did I play that badly?"

669
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:23,480
"No," he said,

670
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:30,946
"but I can't help remembering
August 18, 1934.

671
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:37,998
We played Beethoven's First
together in Linz.

672
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:42,416
You were 20 years old.
The hall was packed.

673
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:46,093
We played like gods.
The orchestra was inspired.

674
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:50,765
Afterwards,
the audience stood up and cheered,

675
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:53,137
and the orchestra played a fanfare."

676
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:01,976
Then he said,
"You wore a simple red summer dress

677
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,733
and had long hair down to your waist."

678
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,946
"How do you remember all that?" I asked.

679
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:14,075
"I wrote it down on my score," he said.

680
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:18,201
"I make a note
of all my great experiences."

681
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:24,215
When I got back to the hotel,
I couldn't sleep.

682
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:31,632
At 3:00 in the morning, I called Papa
and told him I was going to stop touring...

683
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,804
and stay at home with him and you.

684
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,886
We'd be a real family.

685
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:44,147
Josef was so happy.

686
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:47,438
We wept with emotion, both of us.

687
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:51,242
We talked for two hours.

688
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,407
And that was that.

689
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:57,911
That summer we were happy, weren't we?

690
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:00,952
No.

691
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,503
- You weren't happy?
- No.

692
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:09,256
You said things had never been so good.

693
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:15,682
I didn't want to hurt you.

694
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:23,896
Well, that just goes to show you.

695
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:27,148
What did I do wrong?

696
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:29,275
I was 14,

697
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:34,236
and you directed all
of your pent-up energy on me.

698
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:40,454
You were damn well going
to make up for your neglect.

699
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:43,877
I tried to defend myself,
but I didn't have a chance.

700
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:49,379
You trotted out your thoughtfulness
and your worried voice.

701
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:55,048
There wasn't one detail
that escaped your loving energy.

702
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:59,386
I had a stoop.
You got to work with gymnastics.

703
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:03,223
We did exercises together.

704
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:08,857
You thought my hair was too long,
so you had it cut short.

705
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:10,654
It was hideous.

706
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:15,611
Then you got the idea my teeth
were crooked, so I got braces.

707
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:17,410
I looked grotesque.

708
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:21,207
You said I couldn't go around
wearing pants any longer,

709
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:26,583
so you had dresses made
without asking me what I thought.

710
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,550
I didn't dare say no
because I didn't want to upset you.

711
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:36,718
You gave me books to read
that I didn't understand!

712
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:42,224
I read and read,
and then you and I had to discuss them.

713
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:45,522
You'd go on and on, but I didn't know
what you were talking about!

714
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:49,898
I was scared you'd expose my stupidity.

715
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:51,524
I was paralyzed!

716
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:54,023
But one thing I did understand:

717
01:05:54,117 --> 01:06:00,239
There wasn't a shred of the real me
worthy of love or acceptance!

718
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:02,072
You were obsessed.

719
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:05,035
I grew more and more afraid
of being annihilated.

720
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:09,589
I said what you wanted me to say
and copied your gestures!

721
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:12,963
I didn't dare to be myself
even when I was alone

722
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:17,888
because I hated everything about myself!

723
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:22,222
It was horrible, Mama!

724
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:27,353
I still shake all over
when I think of those years!

725
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:30,146
It was horrible!

726
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:35,986
I didn't realize I hated you.

727
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:40,069
I was so sure we loved each other.

728
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:45,457
I couldn't hate you,
so my hatred turned into an insane fear.

729
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:48,703
I had nightmares. I bit my nails.

730
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:51,209
I pulled out tufts of hair.

731
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:54,838
I wanted to cry, but I couldn't.

732
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:57,045
I couldn't make a sound.

733
01:06:57,138 --> 01:07:02,679
I tried to scream,
but I could only make stifled grunts.

734
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:06,388
That frightened me even more.
I thought I was going out of my mind.

735
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,825
- Then came Stefan.
- Who got you pregnant.

736
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:25,907
I was 18!

737
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,868
Stefan was an adult.
We could have managed.

738
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:30,203
No!

739
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:34,540
We wanted to have the child,
but you ruined everything!

740
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:40,221
That's not true!
I told Papa we should wait and see.

741
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:43,140
You didn't realize Stefan was an idiot.

742
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:48,517
Were you present during our conversations?

743
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:51,223
Were you lurking under our bed?

744
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:54,105
Do you even know
what you're talking about?

745
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:59,486
Have you ever given a damn
about any living soul except yourself?

746
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:02,694
If you'd wanted a child, I couldn't have
forced you to have an abortion!

747
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:04,949
How could I defy you?

748
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:10,125
- I was afraid and needed help.
- I tried to help you.

749
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:14,376
I thought abortion was the only way.
I've thought so all along.

750
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:18,459
It's awful! You've carried
this hatred all these years!

751
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:21,796
- Why have you never said anything?
- Because you never listen.

752
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:24,176
You're a goddamn escape artist.

753
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:27,556
You're emotionally crippled.

754
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:30,558
In reality, you detest me and Helena.

755
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:36,777
You're shut up inside yourself
and always put yourself first.

756
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:39,571
I loved you...

757
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:45,778
but you thought I was disgusting,
stupid and a failure.

758
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:51,709
You managed to injure me for life,
just as you are injured.

759
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:55,500
Everything that was sensitive
and delicate, you attacked.

760
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:59,296
Everything that was alive,
you tried to smother.

761
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,641
You talk of my hatred.

762
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:20,650
Your hatred was no less.

763
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:27,411
Your hatred is no less.

764
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:35,203
I was little and malleable and loving.

765
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:39,085
You bound me because you wanted my love,

766
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:43,340
just as you want everyone else's love.

767
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:46,846
I was utterly at your mercy.

768
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:52,553
It was all done in the name of love.

769
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:57,020
You kept saying you loved me
and Papa and Helena.

770
01:09:57,902 --> 01:10:01,691
And you were an expert
at love's intonations and gestures.

771
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:08,160
People like you are a menace.

772
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:13,373
You should be locked away
and rendered harmless.

773
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:33,135
A mother and a daughter.

774
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:43,480
What a terrible combination

775
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:49,820
of feelings and confusion and destruction.

776
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:56,409
Everything is possible and is done
in the name of love and solicitude.

777
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:04,216
The mother's injuries are
handed down to the daughter.

778
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:09,672
The mother's failures are paid for
by the daughter.

779
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:16,353
The mother's unhappiness
will be the daughter's unhappiness.

780
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:22,189
It's as if the umbilical cord
had never been cut.

781
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,359
Is that true?

782
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:35,994
Is the daughter's misfortune
the mother's triumph?

783
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:49,754
Is my grief your secret pleasure?

784
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:46,902
My back's aching.

785
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:51,357
Do you mind if I lie down on the floor?

786
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:54,868
It's the only thing that helps.

787
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:01,325
I remember very little of my childhood.

788
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:06,205
I can't recall my parents
ever touching me,

789
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:10,175
either to caress me or to punish me.

790
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:15,260
I didn't know anything about love,

791
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:21,141
tenderness, contact, intimacy, warmth.

792
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:30,063
Only through music did I have
a chance to show my feelings.

793
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,992
Sometimes, when I lie awake at night...

794
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:40,869
I wonder whether I've lived at all.

795
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:45,581
Is it the same for everybody...

796
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:51,209
or do some people have
a greater talent for living than others?

797
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:55,758
Or do some people never live?

798
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,637
They just exist.

799
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:05,772
Then I'm seized by fear.

800
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:13,235
I'm seized by fear
and see a horrible picture of myself.

801
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,942
I never grew up.

802
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:20,616
My face and my body have aged.

803
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:25,750
I acquire memories and experiences...

804
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:31,749
but underneath all that
I haven't even been born.

805
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:37,549
I can't remember any faces...

806
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:41,179
not even my own.

807
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:47,727
Sometimes,
I try to recall my mother's face...

808
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:50,893
but I can't see her.

809
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:55,197
I know she was big and dark
and had blue eyes,

810
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:59,910
a large nose and full lips...

811
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:03,872
but I can't fit
the various pieces together.

812
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:09,585
I can't see her.

813
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:14,917
In the same way, I can't see your face
or Helena's or Leonardo's.

814
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:19,012
I remember giving birth
to you and your sister,

815
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:24,430
but all I remember about
the deliveries is that they hurt.

816
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:29,769
But the pain? What was that like?

817
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:34,023
I don't remember.

818
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:40,075
Leonardo once said that...

819
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,453
How did he put it, now?

820
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:49,786
"A sense of reality is a matter of talent.

821
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:54,464
Most people lack that talent...

822
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:58,043
and maybe it's just as well."

823
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:04,133
- Do you know what he meant?
- Yes, I do.

824
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:11,348
- How strange.
- Strange?

825
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:17,188
- I've always been afraid of you.
- I can't understand that.

826
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:21,275
I think I wanted you to take care of me...

827
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:26,580
to put your arms around me and comfort me.

828
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:28,907
I was a child.

829
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,839
- Does that matter?
- No.

830
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:38,667
I saw that you loved me,

831
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:43,927
and I wanted to love you, but I couldn't.

832
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,933
I was afraid of your demands.

833
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:52,853
- I didn't have any.
- I thought you did.

834
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:57,652
I didn't want to be your mother.

835
01:16:58,906 --> 01:17:02,195
I wanted you to know
I was as helpless as you were.

836
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,618
Is that really true?

837
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:29,017
- What are you thinking about?
- Leonardo and Helena.

838
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,928
I don't understand.

839
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:35,310
They hardly knew each other.

840
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:40,195
We were together in Bornholm one Easter.

841
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:42,568
You left after three days.

842
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:45,196
I was going to play
Bartók's First in Geneva.

843
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:50,698
I wanted to go through the concerto
with the conductor in peace and quiet...

844
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:54,584
so it's possible I did leave earlier.

845
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:56,787
The weather was awful.

846
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:59,794
Leonardo was in a bad mood. So were you.

847
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:06,467
Why are you making me remember all this?

848
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,423
I'll tell you.

849
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:13,683
You and Leonardo arrived on Thursday.
We had a lovely evening together.

850
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:16,936
We drank wine, sang and laughed

851
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:20,064
<i>and played some old game we found.</i>

852
01:18:20,154 --> 01:18:25,695
Helena wasn't so ill then.
She was happy all evening.

853
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:32,622
Leonardo was happy because she was.
He talked and joked with her.

854
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:37,001
She fell head over heels in love.

855
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:40,373
<i>They sat together until late that night.</i>

856
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:47,505
The next day,
Helena told me Leonardo had kissed her.

857
01:18:56,774 --> 01:18:58,936
That evening, we had guests.

858
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:05,151
Leonardo drank too much
and played all the Bach solo suites.

859
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:09,192
He wasn't himself,

860
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:12,703
heavy and gentle, as if he were enlarged.

861
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:18,289
He played badly but beautifully.

862
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:23,089
Helena sat there in the dusk, beaming.

863
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:25,167
<i>I've never seen anything like it.</i>

864
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:23,855
You and I went for a walk.
You were chattering away.

865
01:20:23,944 --> 01:20:28,780
I didn't really listen.
I was thinking about those two.

866
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:36,163
When we got home,
they were sitting where we'd left them.

867
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:43,416
You went to bed,
and I had to help Leonardo upstairs.

868
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:47,378
Outside the door of the bedroom,

869
01:20:47,468 --> 01:20:51,462
he stopped, looked at me and said...

870
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:55,465
"Can you imagine?

871
01:20:56,268 --> 01:21:00,603
There's a butterfly
fluttering against the window."

872
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:07,394
<i>When I went back to Helena,
she was sitting bolt upright,</i>

873
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:10,818
<i>quite relaxed and calm.</i>

874
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:17,905
<i>There was no trace ofher illness.</i>

875
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:24,540
I'll never forget her face, Mama.

876
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:31,300
I'll never forget her face.

877
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:38,641
The next morning, you left for Geneva...

878
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:43,100
four days earlier than we had agreed.

879
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,683
When you left, you said casually,

880
01:21:47,111 --> 01:21:51,230
"I asked Leonardo to stay.
I see it's doing Helena good."

881
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:54,153
And you smiled.

882
01:21:56,328 --> 01:22:00,538
Leonardo abruptly became
restless and unhappy.

883
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:12,043
On Easter,
he went for a long walk in the rain.

884
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:16,847
When he came back,
he told Helena he was leaving.

885
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:19,682
He said they'd meet again.

886
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:25,514
Then he called Geneva
and talked to you for an hour.

887
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:30,519
That evening, he left on the last plane.

888
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,419
During the night,
I was woken by Helena crying.

889
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:52,420
She complained of pain in her hip
and right leg.

890
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:56,674
She didn't think
she could hold out until morning.

891
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:01,550
At 5:00, I had to call an ambulance.

892
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:08,473
So Lena's illness was my fault?

893
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:11,059
Yes, I think so.

894
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:18,737
- You mean that her illness...
- Yes.

895
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,409
You don't seriously mean...

896
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:28,081
When Lena was a year old,
you deserted her.

897
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:32,539
Then you kept deserting
both of us all the time.

898
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:37,836
When Lena got seriously ill,
you sent her to a home.

899
01:23:38,889 --> 01:23:41,802
- It can't be true.
- What can't be true?

900
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:46,477
Can you prove otherwise?

901
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:51,565
Look at me, Mama.

902
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:55,152
Look at Helena.

903
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:59,824
There are no excuses.

904
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:06,578
There is only one truth and one lie.

905
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,327
There can be no forgiveness.

906
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:13,086
You can't blame me entirely.

907
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:17,463
You expect an exception
to be made for you.

908
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:22,839
You've set up a sort of
discount system with life...

909
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:30,438
but one day you'll see
that your agreement is one-sided.

910
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:36,148
You'll discover you're carrying guilt,
just like everyone else.

911
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:39,655
What guilt?

912
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:46,829
Eva, darling.

913
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:51,952
Won't you forgive me
for all the wrong I've done?

914
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:55,626
I'll try to mend my ways.

915
01:24:57,551 --> 01:25:01,386
You've got to teach me.
We'll talk to each other.

916
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:05,639
But help me.

917
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:08,384
I can't go on.

918
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:10,640
Your hatred is so terrible.

919
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:14,603
I never realized.

920
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:18,903
I've been selfish and childish.

921
01:25:22,492 --> 01:25:24,700
Can't you put your arms around me?

922
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:28,538
Touch me, at least.

923
01:25:31,251 --> 01:25:33,038
Help me.

924
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:38,957
Mama!

925
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:42,926
Come!

926
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:46,130
Help me.

927
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:48,717
Mama!

928
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:53,145
Come!

929
01:26:38,318 --> 01:26:43,279
<i>Poor little Mama, rushing offlike that.</i>

930
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:48,784
<i>She looked so frightened
and suddenly so old and tired.</i>

931
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:55,124
<i>Her face had shrunk,
and her nose was red from crying.</i>

932
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,455
<i>Now I'll never see her again.</i>

933
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:20,650
<i>It'll be dark soon, and it's getting cold.</i>

934
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:25,317
<i>I have to go home and make dinner
for Viktor and Helena.</i>

935
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,368
<i>I can't die now.</i>

936
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:34,530
<i>I'm afraid to commit suicide...</i>

937
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:39,122
<i>and one day maybe God
will have a use for me.</i>

938
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:42,917
<i>Then he'll set me free from myprison.</i>

939
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:03,859
I feel so shut out. I'm always homesick.

940
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:06,566
But when I get home...

941
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:10,942
I find it's something else
I'm longing for.

942
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:15,826
<i>Are you stroking my cheek?</i>

943
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:19,784
<i>Are you whispering in my ear?</i>

944
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:23,211
<i>Are you with me now?</i>

945
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:28,551
<i>We'll never leave each other.</i>

946
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:05,838
<i>There's a light on in Helena's room.</i>

947
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:09,592
<i>Viktor's there, talking to her.</i>

948
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:13,596
<i>That's good, kind ofhim.</i>

949
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:18,184
<i>He's telling her Mama has left.</i>

950
01:29:22,691 --> 01:29:24,774
Your mother sent her love.

951
01:29:25,151 --> 01:29:27,985
She was sad and worried.

952
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:29,687
She'd been crying.

953
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:45,628
Eva went for a walk.

954
01:29:46,339 --> 01:29:48,956
She was so excited to see her mother.

955
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:52,544
She hoped for too much.

956
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:56,264
I hadn't the heart to warn her.

957
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:09,231
I can't understand what you're saying.

958
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,106
You're saying you want to...

959
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:19,241
Try to speak calmly,

960
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:23,041
otherwise I can't understand.

961
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:30,881
Eva! Come quickly!

962
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:52,236
<i>Sometimes I stand looking at my wife</i>

963
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:55,151
<i>without her knowing I'm there.</i>

964
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:59,159
<i>She's in so much distress.</i>

965
01:31:00,038 --> 01:31:03,031
<i>Since Charlotte left so suddenly,</i>

966
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:05,916
<i>she has been terribly upset.</i>

967
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:09,704
<i>She hasn't been able to sleep.</i>

968
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:16,128
<i>She says she drove her mother away,
and she can never forgive herself.</i>

969
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:20,181
- Are you going out?
- Just down to the post office.

970
01:31:20,517 --> 01:31:23,305
Could you please mail this letter for me?

971
01:31:23,395 --> 01:31:24,886
Sure.

972
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:29,273
- It's to Charlotte?
- Read it if you like.

973
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:31,476
I'm going up to Helena.

974
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:41,236
"Dear Mama, I realize that I wronged you.

975
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:45,411
I met you with demands
instead of affection.

976
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:49,953
I tormented you with an old hatred
that's no longer real.

977
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:54,089
I want to ask your forgiveness."

978
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:57,259
I don't know if this letter
will reach you.

979
01:31:57,846 --> 01:32:00,259
I don't even know if you will read it.

980
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:04,516
Maybe it's already too late.

981
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:11,228
But I hope all the same
that my discovery will not be in vain.

982
01:32:12,235 --> 01:32:14,773
There is a kind of mercy after all.

983
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:20,488
I mean the enormous opportunity
of getting to take care of each other...

984
01:32:22,162 --> 01:32:24,074
to help each other...

985
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:27,660
to show affection.

986
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:33,629
I will never let you
vanish out of my life again.

987
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:37,459
I'm going to be persistent.

988
01:32:38,428 --> 01:32:42,172
I won't give up, even if it is too late.

989
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:45,720
<i>I don't think it is too late.</i>

990
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:50,976
<i>It can't be too late.</i>
