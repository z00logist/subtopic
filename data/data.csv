Bergman,Autumn Sonata,"sometimes i stand looking at my wife without her knowing i'm there. the first time she entered this room she said, ""oh, how nice. i feel at home here."" we hadn't known each other long. we met at a bishops' conference in trondheim. she was there as a journalist. i told her about the parsonage out here. i ventured to suggest a visit when the conference was over. on the way, i asked her to marry me. she didn't answer, but, when we entered the room, she said, ""oh, how nice. i feel at home here."" since then we've lived a quiet, happy life at the parsonage. eva has, of course, told me about her earlier life. after finishing school, she went on to college, got engaged to a doctor and lived with him for several years. she wrote two small books... came down with tuberculosis, broke off the engagement and moved from oslo to a small town in the south of norway where she began to work as a journalist. this is the first of her books. i like it so much. she has written... ""one must learn to live. i practice every day. my biggest obstacle is i don't know who i am. i grope blindly. if anyone ever loves me as i am, i may dare at last to look at myself. for me, that possibility is fairly remote."" i'd like to tell her just once that she is loved wholeheartedly... but i can't say it in a way that she'd believe. i can't find the right words. i've written to mama. am i interrupting? no, no. come in. - i'll turn off the radio. - i can come back later. no, please read me the letter. ""dearest mama, i was in town yesterday and ran into agnes, who was visiting her parents. she told me leonardo had died. i know what a terrible blow this must be to you. i was wondering if you'd like to come visit us for a few days or weeks. please don't say no right away. the parsonage is very spacious. you'll have your own room with all the conveniences. we have a piano, and you can practice all you want to. it would make a change from a hotel. please say you'll come. we'll make a fuss over you and spoil you. it's been ages since we saw each other, seven years this october. much love from viktor and eva."" - that's fine. - are you sure? - mama, darling! - eva! well, here i am. - i'm so glad you're here. - yes, just imagine. - it was a long trip. - yes, i know. it's beautiful here. - i hope you'll stay a long time. - indeed i will. - i can't believe you're here. - let's go for a nice long walk. what heavy bags. have you brought all your music? - yes, i'm staying for good. - that would be nice. - you'll give me some lessons, won't you? - yes. - where's viktor? - he's not home at the moment. we didn't think you'd arrive so early. - this is your room. - it's lovely. - and what a beautiful view. - the bathroom's here. - how nice and modern. - thank you. - i hope one wardrobe is enough. - everything's fine. i really am very tired. my back hurts. i sat with leonardo through his last day and night. he was in bad pain. they gave him shots every two hours. now and then he cried because it hurt. he wasn't afraid of dying. outside the hospital, they were drilling and hammering. the sun was blazing down, and there were no awnings. we tried to get another room, but many wards were closed for repairs. towards evening the noise stopped and i could open the window. the heat outside was like a wall, and not a breath of wind. in the evening the doctor came. he's an old friend. he said it wouldn't be long. leonardo would get a shot every half hour so he could die without pain. then the doctor left and the ward nurse came in. she said i should eat, but i wasn't hungry. the smell was making me sick. leonardo dozed off... then woke up and asked me to leave the room. he called the night nurse, and she came in with a shot. a minute or two later, she came out and said... leonardo was dead. i sat with him all night. he had been my friend for 18 years. we had lived together for 13 and had never had an angry word. for two years, he had known he was ill, and there was no hope. as often as i could, i went to see him at his villa near naples. he was kind and thoughtful and happy about my success. we talked and joked and played chamber music. he hardly ever spoke of his illness, and he wouldn't have liked me to ask. one day he gave me a long look... then laughed and said... ""this time next year i'll be gone... but i'll always be with you. i'll always be thinking of you."" it was sweet of him to say so, but he was apt to be rather theatrical. i can't say i go around grieving. of course he left a gap, but it's no good fretting. do you think i've changed much? you're just the same. i dye my hair of course. leonardo doesn't like gray hair. otherwise i'm the same, don't you think? i bought this outfit in zurich. i wanted something comfortable for the trip. i saw it in a window, went in, tried it on, and it fit perfectly. it was so cheap. - don't you think it's nice? - yes, very. will you help me with this case? my back's giving me hell. do you have a board to put under the mattress? i need a hard surface. - we put one there yesterday. - wonderful. eva, dear, what is it? did i say something wrong? i'm just so glad to see you. give me a nice big hug, like you used to when you were little. i've done nothing but talk about myself. tell me about you. - how are things? - oh, fine. do you lead a very isolated life? no, we have our parish work. yes, of course. i often play the organ. last month i had a musical evening. i played and talked about each piece. - i hope you'll play for me. - i'd love to. i gave five school concerts in los angeles. 3,000 children each time. i played and talked to them. i was a huge success. there's something i have to tell you. helena is here. you should have told me. if i had, you wouldn't have come. i'm sure i would have. and i'm sure you wouldn't have. isn't leonardo's death enough? why drag poor lena here too? she's been here for the last two years. viktor and i asked her if she'd like to live with us. - i wrote to tell you. - i never got the letter. or else you never bothered to read it. - aren't you being rather unfair? - yes. i'm sorry. i'm not up to seeing her. at any rate, not today. helena is a wonderful person. she's longing to see you. it seemed so nice for her at that home. i wanted her with me. are you sure she's better off here? yes. and i have someone to look after. has she... i mean is she... is she worse? oh, yes, she's worse. it's part of the disease. come along then. let's go and see her. - are you sure? - i have no choice. some people are so nagyive. - you mean me? - if the shoe fits. come on. let's go. dear lena! i've thought of you so often, every day. helena is afraid of giving you her cold. i haven't had a cold for 20 years. what a lovely room you have, and what a view. i have the same view from my room. helena wants you to take her head in your hands. like that? i'm so glad eva's looking after you. i thought you were still at that home. i would have come to visit. but it's much better like this, isn't it? now we can be together every day. are you in pain? no. i love how you've done your hair. it's in your honor. suppose i read aloud to you? would you like that? and we can go for a drive. i've never been around here before. what? helena says you must be very tired and not to exert yourself any more today. well done, mama. - doesn't lena have a wristwatch? - of course. it's on the nightstand. i'll give you mine. it was a gift from an admirer who said i was always late. - will lena be having dinner with us? - no, she's on a diet. she ate far too much at the hospital. why do i feel like i have a fever? why do i want to cry? i'm to be put to shame. that's the idea. a guilty conscience. always a guilty conscience! i was in such a hurry to get here. what was i expecting? what was i longing for so desperately? what an extraordinary mother. you should have seen her when i told her lena was here. she actually smiled. can you believe she actually managed to produce a smile despite her surprise and alarm? then, as we stood outside lena's door, she was like an actress waiting for her entrance, scared but in control. the performance was superb. why on earth did she come here? what did she expect would happen after seven years? - what did she expect? - i wonder. and what did i expect? - we never give up hope, do we? - i don't think so. don't we ever stop being mother and daughter? no use starting to cry. damn it! there she sat, gazing at me with her big eyes. i held her face and felt the disease twitching at her throat muscles. damn it! to think i can't carry her to my bed and comfort her as i did when she was three. that soft, torn body... that's my lena. don't cry, for christ's sake. a writer whose name i've forgotten said, ""it's like a ghost falling on top of you when you open the door to the nursery having long since forgotten it is the nursery."" do you think i'm an adult? i guess being an adult is being able to handle your dreams and hopes, not longing for things. do you think so? maybe you stop being surprised. you look so sensible with your old pipe. you're very adult. i don't know. i'm surprised every day. - at what? - at you. and i have the most unreasonable dreams and hopes. and a longing too, come to that. - a longing? - yes. i long for you. those are very pretty words. words don't mean anything real. i was brought up with beautiful words. mama is never furious or disappointed or unhappy. she is ""pained."" you have a lot of words like that too. it's kind of an occupational disease. if you long for me when i'm here, i'll start getting suspicious. - you know what i mean. - no. if i knew, it would never have entered your head to say you long for me. i have to check the veal roast. mama thinks i'm a hopeless cook. she's a real glutton. - i think you're a... - ...wonderful cook. thank you. and she's having decaffeinated coffee. i'll cut my visit short. i can manage four days. then i'll go to africa as i had originally planned. this hurts, charlotte. it hurts, hurts, hurts. i've often wondered why she sleeps badly. now i know. if that woman slept normally, her vitality would crush everyone. her insomnia is nature's way of using up the surplus energy. i'll put on my red dress just to spite eva. i'm sure she thinks i ought to be in mourning. watch how carefully she dresses for dinner. her dress will be a discreet reminder that she's a lonely widow. i'm angry all the time. viktor and eva have been sweet to me. viktor's a kind soul. lucky for eva, the crybaby. i'll bet the shower doesn't work. yes, it does. - what a lovely dress! - does it suit me? one day i met a friend who said, ""i've just come from a fashion show. there was a divine red dress that's absolutely you."" to your health, charlotte. we're delighted to have you with us. eva, see if i left my glasses on the table. thank you, darling. that was my agent. he's so sweet. he's the only friend i have left. you remember old paul, eva. we've worked together for 30 years now. what a fine old instrument. what a lovely tone. and just tuned. now i'm really happy. - i didn't need to worry. - what do you mean, mama? i was nervous, seeing you again after so many years. i nearly didn't come. no sugar, please. this strange coffee is a bore, but what can i do when i can't sleep? i see you're working on the chopin preludes. - play something. - not now. don't be childish. you'd give me great pleasure. but you wanted your mother to hear you play. but it's all a sham. i have no technique. i haven't even bothered to learn the fingering. darling, no more excuses. come on, now, play. eva, my dearest. - is that all? - i was just so moved. - did you like it? - i liked you. - i don't understand. - play something else. - what was wrong with it? - nothing. you didn't like my interpretation. - we each have our own. - exactly. i want to know yours. - you're annoyed. - no, i'm upset. you won't tell me your interpretation of this prelude. all right, if you insist. your technique wasn't bad at all, though you might have taken more interest in cortot's fingering, but let's just talk about the conception. chopin was emotional, but not sentimental. feeling is very far from sentimentality. the prelude tells of pain, not reverie. you have to be calm, clear and harsh. take the first bars now. it hurts, but he doesn't show it. then a short relief. but it evaporates immediately, and the pain is the same. total restraint the whole time. chopin was proud, passionate, tormented and very manly. he wasn't a sentimental old woman. this prelude must sound almost ugly. it is never ingratiating. it should sound wrong. you have to battle your way through it and emerge triumphant. like this. i see. don't be annoyed with me. why would i be? on the contrary. for 45 years, i've worked at these terrible preludes. they still contain a lot of secrets. when i was little, i admired you so much. then i got pretty tired of you and your pianos. now i admire you again, but in a different way. - then there's some hope. - yes, i guess so. - where are you? - i'm up here, mama. i've changed, so we can go for a walk if you like. - is this the nursery? - yes, it's erik's room. why would you keep it this way? we've often talked about changing it. sometimes i come and sit here and let my thoughts wander. - let's go. - wait, mama. just feel how nice it is in here. erik drowned the day before his fourth birthday. but you know that. it was too much for viktor. i grieved a lot, outwardly. deep inside, i felt like he was still alive, that we were living close to each other. all i have to do is concentrate, and he's there. sometimes, as i'm falling asleep i can feel him breathing on my face and touching me with his hand. he's living another life, but we can reach one another. there's no dividing line, no insurmountable wall. i wonder what reality looks like where my little boy is living. i know it can't be described. it's a world of liberated feelings. do you know what i mean? to me, man is a tremendous creation, an inconceivable thought. in man, there is everything, from the highest to the lowest. man is god's image, and in god there is everything. so human beings are created, but also the demons and the saints, the prophets and artists and iconoclasts. everything exists side by side. it's like huge patterns changing all the time. do you know what i mean? in the same way, there must also be countless realities. not only the reality we perceive with our dull senses, but a tumult of realities arching above each other inside and outside. it's just fear and priggishness to believe in limits. there are no limits. neither for thoughts nor for feelings. it's anxiety that sets limits, don't you think so? when you play the slow movement of the hammerklavier sonata, you must feel like you're living in a world without limitations, in a movement you can never see through or explore. let's go for a walk before it gets too dark. yes. i thought i heard helena calling. excuse me. i think eva is terribly unhappy. i'm appalled when i hear her rambling on. it's so neurotic. just a moment, charlotte, and i'll try to explain how i see my wife. when i asked eva to marry me, she said she didn't love me. - what do you mean? - i asked if she loved someone else. she said she had never loved anyone, that she was incapable of loving. eva and i lived here for several years. then erik was born. we'd given up hope of a child of our own and had talked about adopting one. with her pregnancy, eva underwent a complete change. she became cheerful, gentle and outgoing. she got lazy. she lost interest in her parish work and her piano playing. she would sit by that window, gazing at the play of light over the mountains and fjords. we were suddenly very happy. i'm much older than eva. i felt as if a gray film were settling over life. i felt as if i could look back and say, ""well, well, so that was my life. that's how it all turned out."" but suddenly things were different. please forgive me, but it's still rather hard to... yes. we had some years that were very rich. erik. you should have seen eva. you really should have seen her. at the time of erik's birth, i was recording all the mozart sonatas. - i couldn't get one day off. - no. we invited you over and over again. when erik drowned, that gray film got even grayer. for eva, it was different. - different? - her feeling lives on, uncorroded. or so it seems anyway. if she feels that her son is alive and near her... well, perhaps that's how it is. she seldom speaks of it. i guess she's afraid it might upset me, as indeed it would. but what she says sounds true enough. i believe her. yes, you're a minister. the little faith i have lives on her terms. i'm sorry if i hurt you. it doesn't matter. unlike you and eva, i'm confused and uncertain. it's my own fault. i think i'll take a nice dose of sleeping pills tonight. it's so peaceful here, only the hiss of the rain on the roof. - do you have everything you need? - couldn't be better. cookies, mineral water, a tape recorder, two detective novels, my blindfold, earplugs, my spare pillow and my travel blanket. would you like to taste my delicious swiss chocolate? fresh from zurich. help yourself. you can have two pieces. i don't like chocolate. i seem to remember you were crazy about candy as a child. helena liked it. i didn't. good, all the more for me. - good night, mama. - good night, my pet. viktor is a wonderful person. - you must take care of him. - i do. eva, darling, are you happy together? do you get along? viktor is my best friend. i can't imagine life without him. he said you didn't love him. - did he say that? - yes. - why? - oh, it's just surprising. was it a secret? - but he shouldn't have said it? - he's not the confiding type. we were talking about you. if you want to know anything, ask me. i'll tell you the truth. now, don't get upset. a mother naturally worries about her daughter. we spoke of you with the greatest affection. if only you'd leave people alone. i've left you alone far too long. - you're right. - give me a hug. - promise you're not angry. - i'm not. - i love you, don't you see? - i love you too. it's not much fun being alone all the time. i envy you and viktor. now that leonardo's dead, i'm so lonely. - do you understand? - yes. i'll start weeping with self-pity any minute. this book isn't bad. it's by adam kretzinsky. have you heard of him? i met him in madrid. he's mad as a hatter. i couldn't defend myself. in fact, i didn't. - should i turn off this light? - yes, please. - i'll bring you your breakfast. - don't trouble yourself. - but i want to spoil you. - very well, if you insist. strong coffee, hot milk, two slices of german bread with cheese, one slice of toast with honey. - and orange juice. - i nearly forgot. - i can... - juice it will be. - good night, darling. - good night, mama. i think i'll have a look at my accounts. i'll have brammer invest the money from leonardo. the house is worth quite a bit too. leonardo, you never looked after your money. you were above mundane worries... and left all these problems to your charlotte. 3,735,866 francs. to think you had so much money. who'd have thought it? and you left it all to your old charlotte. i've got a little nest egg too. together, it comes to over five million. what am i going to do with so much money? i'll buy a nice car for viktor and eva. they can't drive around in that old rattletrap. on monday we'll go into town and look for a new car. it'll cheer them up. me too. ""she offered him the red flower of her virginity. he accepted it without enthusiasm."" this is trash. adam was really quite an idiot, even if he did nearly commit suicide because of me. supposing i buy a new car for myself and give them the mercedes? then i can fly to paris and buy a car there, and i won't have to drive all that way. tomorrow, i have to work on ravel. it's disgraceful how lazy i've been lately. mama, what happened? i heard you call out, and you weren't in your room. i'm sorry i woke you, but i had such a horrible dream. i can't remember it. - do you want some company? - no, thank you, dear. - you go back to bed. - very well. - you do like me, don't you? - you're my mother. that's one way of answering. - do you like me? - i love you. do you? i broke off my career to stay at home with you and papa. your back prevented you from practicing six hours a day. your playing got worse and so did your reviews. - have you forgotten that? - no, but eva... i don't know which i hated more, when you were at home or when you were on tour. i realize now you made life hell for papa and me. eva, sweetheart, that's not true. your father and i were very happy. josef loved me, and i'd have done anything for him. yes, of course. - you were unfaithful to him. - i was not! i was quite honest with josef. i fell in love with martin and lived with him for eight months. it wasn't a bed of roses. i was the one who had to sit with papa in the evenings. i was the one who had to comfort him, to keep repeating that you did love him just the same, that you were sure to come back. i read your letters out loud, your long, loving, amusing letters in which you told us of your interesting travels. we sat there like two idiots, reading your letters over and over. we thought you were the most wonderful person alive. you hate me. i don't know. i was so excited that you were coming. i don't know what i was imagining. maybe i thought you were lonely and sad. i'm so confused! i thought i was an adult and could look clearly at you and me and helena's illness and our childhood. now it's all one big mess. helena. it's all right now. wake up. wake up now. there, there. i'll sit here with you until you go to sleep. for you, i was just a doll you played with when you had time. if i was sick or naughty, you handed me over to the nanny. you shut yourself in and worked, and no one was allowed to disturb you. i used to stand outside, listening. when you stopped for coffee, i'd go in to see ifyou really existed. you were always kind, but your mind was elsewhere. if i spoke, you barely answered. thank you. mama wants to be left alone now. run along and play outside. it's such a lovely day. i always wanted to be beautiful like you. i always worried that you wouldn't like the way i looked. i was so ugly, lean and angular with big cow's eyes, big wide lips and no eyebrows. my arms were too thin and my feet too big. i thought i looked repulsive. once you said, ""you should have been a boy,"" and laughed so i wouldn't be upset. i was, of course. then, one day, your suitcases would be downstairs, and you'd be talking on the phone in a foreign language. i used to pray that something would stop you from leaving... but you always went. you'd hug me and kiss me, then hug and kiss me again. you'd look at me and smile. you smelled nice but strange. you yourself were a stranger, already on your way. you didn't see me. then you'd be gone. i used to think, ""now i'll die. it hurts so much. i'll never be happy again. how can i bear this pain for two months?"" and i'd cry in papa's lap. he'd sit very still with his soft hand on my head. he'd keep on sitting there, smoking his old pipe. sometimes he'd say, ""let's go to a movie this evening,"" or ""what about ice cream for dinner today?"" but i just wanted to die. so the days and weeks passed. we shared the loneliness very well. we didn't have much to say, but i never disturbed him. sometimes he'd look worried. i didn't know then that he was always short of money. but whenever i'd come clumping along, his face would brighten, and he'd pat me with his pale little hand. or else uncle otto would be sitting on the sofa, drinking brandy. they'd mumble to each other. i wonder if they could hear each other. or else uncle harry would be there and they'd play chess... and then it'd be extra quiet. i could hear three different clocks ticking. a few days before you were due home, i'd get a fever from the excitement. i'd worry i might really get sick, because you were afraid of sick people. when you did come, i was so happy i couldn't say anything. you'd get impatient and say, ""eva doesn't seem verypleased to have her mother home again."" i'd blush red as a beet and break out in a sweat. i couldn't say anything. i had no words. you had taken charge of all the words in our home. - you're exaggerating. - i must finish speaking. i know i'm tipsy, but otherwise i wouldn't have said what i have. when i'm too ashamed to say any more, you can explain, and i'll listen and understand, just as i've always done. i loved you, mama. as a matter of life and death. but i distrusted your words. they didn't match the expression in your eyes. you have a beautiful voice. when i was little, i could feel it all over my body. but i knew instinctively you didn't mean what you said. i couldn't understand your words. the most horrible thing was, you'd smile when you were mad. when you hated papa, you'd call him, ""my dearest."" when you were tired of me, you'd say, ""darling little girl."" it's gotten quiet in here. what can i say? defend yourself. is it worth the effort? how would i know? you reproach me for leaving, and you reproach me for staying home. i had a hell of a time those years. my back hurt. i couldn't practice. important engagements were canceled. my life seemed meaningless. i felt guilty about always being away from you and papa. you're smiling sarcastically. i'm trying to tell you the truth. i'm merely telling you how i felt. we may as well have this out for once. then we won't refer to it again. go on. i was in hamburg, playing beethoven's first. it's not too difficult, and everything had gone well. after the concert, schmiess and i... you know, the conductor. he's dead now. we went to get a bite to eat. we always did. after we'd been eating and drinking for a while, and i was content and relaxed and my back wasn't aching, schmiess said... ""why don't you stay at home with your husband and child and lead a respectable life, instead of exposing yourself to constant humiliation?"" i stared at him and laughed and said, ""did i play that badly?"" ""no,"" he said, ""but i can't help remembering august 18, 1934. we played beethoven's first together in linz. you were 20 years old. the hall was packed. we played like gods. the orchestra was inspired. afterwards, the audience stood up and cheered, and the orchestra played a fanfare."" then he said, ""you wore a simple red summer dress and had long hair down to your waist."" ""how do you remember all that?"" i asked. ""i wrote it down on my score,"" he said. ""i make a note of all my great experiences."" when i got back to the hotel, i couldn't sleep. at 3:00 in the morning, i called papa and told him i was going to stop touring... and stay at home with him and you. we'd be a real family. josef was so happy. we wept with emotion, both of us. we talked for two hours. and that was that. that summer we were happy, weren't we? no. - you weren't happy? - no. you said things had never been so good. i didn't want to hurt you. well, that just goes to show you. what did i do wrong? i was 14, and you directed all of your pent-up energy on me. you were damn well going to make up for your neglect. i tried to defend myself, but i didn't have a chance. you trotted out your thoughtfulness and your worried voice. there wasn't one detail that escaped your loving energy. i had a stoop. you got to work with gymnastics. we did exercises together. you thought my hair was too long, so you had it cut short. it was hideous. then you got the idea my teeth were crooked, so i got braces. i looked grotesque. you said i couldn't go around wearing pants any longer, so you had dresses made without asking me what i thought. i didn't dare say no because i didn't want to upset you. you gave me books to read that i didn't understand! i read and read, and then you and i had to discuss them. you'd go on and on, but i didn't know what you were talking about! i was scared you'd expose my stupidity. i was paralyzed! but one thing i did understand: there wasn't a shred of the real me worthy of love or acceptance! you were obsessed. i grew more and more afraid of being annihilated. i said what you wanted me to say and copied your gestures! i didn't dare to be myself even when i was alone because i hated everything about myself! it was horrible, mama! i still shake all over when i think of those years! it was horrible! i didn't realize i hated you. i was so sure we loved each other. i couldn't hate you, so my hatred turned into an insane fear. i had nightmares. i bit my nails. i pulled out tufts of hair. i wanted to cry, but i couldn't. i couldn't make a sound. i tried to scream, but i could only make stifled grunts. that frightened me even more. i thought i was going out of my mind. - then came stefan. - who got you pregnant. i was 18! stefan was an adult. we could have managed. no! we wanted to have the child, but you ruined everything! that's not true! i told papa we should wait and see. you didn't realize stefan was an idiot. were you present during our conversations? were you lurking under our bed? do you even know what you're talking about? have you ever given a damn about any living soul except yourself? if you'd wanted a child, i couldn't have forced you to have an abortion! how could i defy you? - i was afraid and needed help. - i tried to help you. i thought abortion was the only way. i've thought so all along. it's awful! you've carried this hatred all these years! - why have you never said anything? - because you never listen. you're a goddamn escape artist. you're emotionally crippled. in reality, you detest me and helena. you're shut up inside yourself and always put yourself first. i loved you... but you thought i was disgusting, stupid and a failure. you managed to injure me for life, just as you are injured. everything that was sensitive and delicate, you attacked. everything that was alive, you tried to smother. you talk of my hatred. your hatred was no less. your hatred is no less. i was little and malleable and loving. you bound me because you wanted my love, just as you want everyone else's love. i was utterly at your mercy. it was all done in the name of love. you kept saying you loved me and papa and helena. and you were an expert at love's intonations and gestures. people like you are a menace. you should be locked away and rendered harmless. a mother and a daughter. what a terrible combination of feelings and confusion and destruction. everything is possible and is done in the name of love and solicitude. the mother's injuries are handed down to the daughter. the mother's failures are paid for by the daughter. the mother's unhappiness will be the daughter's unhappiness. it's as if the umbilical cord had never been cut. is that true? is the daughter's misfortune the mother's triumph? is my grief your secret pleasure? my back's aching. do you mind if i lie down on the floor? it's the only thing that helps. i remember very little of my childhood. i can't recall my parents ever touching me, either to caress me or to punish me. i didn't know anything about love, tenderness, contact, intimacy, warmth. only through music did i have a chance to show my feelings. sometimes, when i lie awake at night... i wonder whether i've lived at all. is it the same for everybody... or do some people have a greater talent for living than others? or do some people never live? they just exist. then i'm seized by fear. i'm seized by fear and see a horrible picture of myself. i never grew up. my face and my body have aged. i acquire memories and experiences... but underneath all that i haven't even been born. i can't remember any faces... not even my own. sometimes, i try to recall my mother's face... but i can't see her. i know she was big and dark and had blue eyes, a large nose and full lips... but i can't fit the various pieces together. i can't see her. in the same way, i can't see your face or helena's or leonardo's. i remember giving birth to you and your sister, but all i remember about the deliveries is that they hurt. but the pain? what was that like? i don't remember. leonardo once said that... how did he put it, now? ""a sense of reality is a matter of talent. most people lack that talent... and maybe it's just as well."" - do you know what he meant? - yes, i do. - how strange. - strange? - i've always been afraid of you. - i can't understand that. i think i wanted you to take care of me... to put your arms around me and comfort me. i was a child. - does that matter? - no. i saw that you loved me, and i wanted to love you, but i couldn't. i was afraid of your demands. - i didn't have any. - i thought you did. i didn't want to be your mother. i wanted you to know i was as helpless as you were. is that really true? - what are you thinking about? - leonardo and helena. i don't understand. they hardly knew each other. we were together in bornholm one easter. you left after three days. i was going to play bartgik's first in geneva. i wanted to go through the concerto with the conductor in peace and quiet... so it's possible i did leave earlier. the weather was awful. leonardo was in a bad mood. so were you. why are you making me remember all this? i'll tell you. you and leonardo arrived on thursday. we had a lovely evening together. we drank wine, sang and laughed and played some old game we found. helena wasn't so ill then. she was happy all evening. leonardo was happy because she was. he talked and joked with her. she fell head over heels in love. they sat together until late that night. the next day, helena told me leonardo had kissed her. that evening, we had guests. leonardo drank too much and played all the bach solo suites. he wasn't himself, heavy and gentle, as if he were enlarged. he played badly but beautifully. helena sat there in the dusk, beaming. i've never seen anything like it. you and i went for a walk. you were chattering away. i didn't really listen. i was thinking about those two. when we got home, they were sitting where we'd left them. you went to bed, and i had to help leonardo upstairs. outside the door of the bedroom, he stopped, looked at me and said... ""can you imagine? there's a butterfly fluttering against the window."" when i went back to helena, she was sitting bolt upright, quite relaxed and calm. there was no trace ofher illness. i'll never forget her face, mama. i'll never forget her face. the next morning, you left for geneva... four days earlier than we had agreed. when you left, you said casually, ""i asked leonardo to stay. i see it's doing helena good."" and you smiled. leonardo abruptly became restless and unhappy. on easter, he went for a long walk in the rain. when he came back, he told helena he was leaving. he said they'd meet again. then he called geneva and talked to you for an hour. that evening, he left on the last plane. during the night, i was woken by helena crying. she complained of pain in her hip and right leg. she didn't think she could hold out until morning. at 5:00, i had to call an ambulance. so lena's illness was my fault? yes, i think so. - you mean that her illness... - yes. you don't seriously mean... when lena was a year old, you deserted her. then you kept deserting both of us all the time. when lena got seriously ill, you sent her to a home. - it can't be true. - what can't be true? can you prove otherwise? look at me, mama. look at helena. there are no excuses. there is only one truth and one lie. there can be no forgiveness. you can't blame me entirely. you expect an exception to be made for you. you've set up a sort of discount system with life... but one day you'll see that your agreement is one-sided. you'll discover you're carrying guilt, just like everyone else. what guilt? eva, darling. won't you forgive me for all the wrong i've done? i'll try to mend my ways. you've got to teach me. we'll talk to each other. but help me. i can't go on. your hatred is so terrible. i never realized. i've been selfish and childish. can't you put your arms around me? touch me, at least. help me. mama! come! help me. mama! come! poor little mama, rushing offlike that. she looked so frightened and suddenly so old and tired. her face had shrunk, and her nose was red from crying. now i'll never see her again. it'll be dark soon, and it's getting cold. i have to go home and make dinner for viktor and helena. i can't die now. i'm afraid to commit suicide... and one day maybe god will have a use for me. then he'll set me free from myprison. i feel so shut out. i'm always homesick. but when i get home... i find it's something else i'm longing for. are you stroking my cheek? are you whispering in my ear? are you with me now? we'll never leave each other. there's a light on in helena's room. viktor's there, talking to her. that's good, kind ofhim. he's telling her mama has left. your mother sent her love. she was sad and worried. she'd been crying. eva went for a walk. she was so excited to see her mother. she hoped for too much. i hadn't the heart to warn her. i can't understand what you're saying. you're saying you want to... try to speak calmly, otherwise i can't understand. eva! come quickly! sometimes i stand looking at my wife without her knowing i'm there. she's in so much distress. since charlotte left so suddenly, she has been terribly upset. she hasn't been able to sleep. she says she drove her mother away, and she can never forgive herself. - are you going out? - just down to the post office. could you please mail this letter for me? sure. - it's to charlotte? - read it if you like. i'm going up to helena. ""dear mama, i realize that i wronged you. i met you with demands instead of affection. i tormented you with an old hatred that's no longer real. i want to ask your forgiveness."" i don't know if this letter will reach you. i don't even know if you will read it. maybe it's already too late. but i hope all the same that my discovery will not be in vain. there is a kind of mercy after all. i mean the enormous opportunity of getting to take care of each other... to help each other... to show affection. i will never let you vanish out of my life again. i'm going to be persistent. i won't give up, even if it is too late. i don't think it is too late. it can't be too late."
Bergman,Cries and whispers,"it is early monday morning... and i am in pain. my sisters... and anna... are taking turns staying up. good morning. did anything happen? no, she was quiet... i think. i fell asleep. anna, see to the fire. i thank thee, dear lord, for allowing me to awaken well and cheerful this morning after a good sleep under thy protection, and for the enjoyment of a restful night. i beseech thee again today and every day to let thine angels watch over and protect my little girl whom thou in thy unfathomable wisdom tookest unto thyself in heaven. mother is in my thoughts nearly every day, though she's been dead for over 20 years. i remember she would often seek the peace and solitude of the grounds. i remember too how i'd follow her at a distance and spy on her unnoticed, because i loved her to such a jealous extreme. i loved her because she was so gentle and beautiful and alive and so very, very present. but she could also be coolly dismissive or playfully cruel. yet i couldn't help feeling sorry for her, and now that i'm older, i understand her much better. i wish i could see her again and tell her that i understand her boredom, her impatience, her longing, and her loneliness. and when the wicked witch at last realized that little gretel had tricked her, her nose began to grow and grow... for twelfth night mother always gave a party, and aunt olga would come with her magic lantern and her fairy tales. i always felt frightened and left out. when mother spoke to me in her excitable way, i could hardly understand what she wanted of me. maria and mother always had so much to whisper about, but then they were so alike. i used to wonderjealously what they had to laugh at. everyone was in high spirits. i alone could notjoin in the merriment. i remember another time one autumn... when i hid behind the curtains and watched her in secret. she sat in her white dress in the red drawing room. she sat quite still, her head bent over, her hands resting on the table. suddenly she noticed me and softly called to me. i approached hesitantly, thinking she was going to criticize me, as usual. but instead she gave me a look so full of sorrow that i nearly burst into tears. i placed my hand on her cheek... and for that moment we were very close. there's someone out there. anna. there's someone out there. good morning, agnes. good morning, doctor. she's very tired. i don't think it will be long now. i'll find my way out, thank you. david. it's been so long. when can we meet again? no. maria and her husband, joakim, had stayed at the manor some years earlier, when agnes had gone to italy for her health. one evening, anna's little daughter was taken quite ill, and maria sent for the family doctor from a nearby town. say ""ah."" once more. that hurt a bit, i know. good girl. that wasn't too bad, eh? into bed with you now. get a little sleep. - thank you. - you must be hungry, doctor. there's supper in the other room, if you'd like. that would be very nice. thank you. agnes and karin are still in italy. i got a letter last week. agnes is much better. her cough is gone. she's taken up painting again. karin's husband joined them at easter. the weather's been good, almost like summer... though the nights are chilly. and how's your husband? joakim had some business in town. he'll be back tomorrow. i mentioned you'd be coming to look in on anna's little girl. he sends his best. - thank you. i made up the guest room for you. the weather's so awful. you shouldn't be going home in this weather. you've changed. - really? is there someone else? there's always someone else... though i never thought the matter would interest you. it doesn't. you wear spectacles now? am i bothering you? - not at all. why are you so reserved? couldn't we forget about the past? come here, marie. come. look in the mirror. you're beautiful. perhaps even more than when we were together. but you've changed, and i want you to see how. now your eyes cast quick, calculating side glances. you used to look ahead straightforwardly, openly... without disguise. your mouth has a slightly hungry, dissatisfied expression. it used to be so soft. your complexion is pale now. you wear makeup. your fine, wide brow has four lines above each eye now. you can't see them in this light, but you can in the bright light of day. you know what caused those lines? no. indifference. and this fine contour from your ear to your chin is no longer so finely drawn... the result of too much comfort and laziness. and there, by the bridge of your nose. why do you sneer so often? you see that? you sneer too often. you see it? and look under your eyes. the sharp, scarcely noticeable wrinkles from your boredom and impatience. can you really see all that there? no, but i feel it when you kiss me. i think you're joking with me. i know where you see it. where? in yourself. because you and i are so alike. you mean... in our selfishness... coldness... and indifference? your arguments have always bored me. are there no extenuating circumstances for such as you and i? i have no need of pardon. good morning, sir. good morning. thank you. good morning, joakim. welcome home. good morning, maria. anna's little girl is quite ill. the doctor was here last night. he sends his regards and hopes you can get together again for chess soon. i asked him to stay overnight because the weather was so bad. he left early this morning before anyone was up. did you enjoy yourself in town, or were you terribly busy? we received an invitation from the egermans. they'd like us to stay with them at easter. i think it would be very nice. for a change of pace. what do you think? we'll see. run along and play. joakim. help me. please help me. no. anna. you hear that? i hear only the wind and the ticking of the clocks. no... it's something else. i don't hear anything else. i'm freezing. good night. come here. come to me. you're so far away. come here. here by my side. do i smell very bad? it hurts so much. - i know, agnes. i'll stay with you. it will be all right. - it hurts so bad. you needn't be afraid when i'm here. you know that. the pillow's so warm. we can get the other one. come. can you sit up a bit? now lie back. is that better? is that good? you're so good to me. yes? what is it? agnes is worse. i think she's unconscious. her breathing's very strange. i'll get my shawl. karin. - what is it? - agnes is worse. i'm coming. - i'll go for the doctor. - i'll go with you. - when's the doctor coming? - he wasn't home. you'd better get dressed. i'll stay with her. i'm much better now. just a bit warm. how about a little bath and a clean gown? yes, thank you. i'm a bit thirsty. shall i read a bit? that would be wonderful. ""chapter 34, in which mr. pickwick thinks he had better go to bath, and goes accordingly. 'but surely, my dear sir, ' said little perker as he stood in mr. pickwick's apartment on the morning after the trial, 'surely you don't really mean... really and seriously now, and irritation apart... that you won't pay these costs and damages?' 'not one halfpenny, ' said mr. pickwick firmly. 'not one halfpenny.' 'hoorah for the principle, as the moneylender said when he wouldn't renew the bill, ' observed mr. weller, who was clearing away breakfast. 'sam, ' said mr. pickwick, 'have the goodness to step downstairs.' 'certainly, sir, ' replied mr. weller, and acting on mr. pickwick's gentle hint, sam retired."" anna! i can't take it! can't anyone help me? i can't take it! help me! i can't... god our father... in his infinite wisdom, has called you home to him still in the bloom of your youth. in your life he found you worthy of bearing a long and torturous agony. you submitted patiently and without complaint in the certain knowledge that your sins would be forgiven through the death of your lord jesus christ on the cross. may your father in heaven have mercy on your soul when you come before him. may he let his angels remove from you the memory of your earthly pain. should it be that you gathered up our suffering into your poor body... and should it be that you bore it with you through death... and should you meet god in that other land... and should he turn his countenance toward you... and should you know the language to speak so that this god may hear and understand you... and should you be allowed to speak with him... should all of this be so... then pray for us. agnes, my dear child... listen to what i tell you now. pray for those of us left behind on this dark and miserable earth beneath a cruel and empty sky. lay your suffering at god's feet and plead with him to pardon us. plead with him to free us of our anxiety... our weariness... and our deepest doubts. plead with him to give meaning to our lives. agnes, you who have long borne this inscrutable suffering, you are most surely worthy of pleading our cause. she was my confirmation child. we had many long and intimate discussions. her faith was stronger than mine. stop by the parish office tomorrow and we can discuss the formalities of the funeral. karin and her husband, fredrik, were pursuing a diplomatic career some years earlier. during a visit home, they stayed for some months at the manor. anna, may i have a little more fish? will you join me? - no, thank you. what are you smiling about? i'm not smiling. would you like coffee, or will we be retiring? no coffee, thank you. it's late. i suggest we retire now. it's a web of lies, all of it. don't look at me. don't look at me like that, you hear? i'm sorry. forgive me. help me undress. you may go. nothing but a web of lies. every bit of it. a web of lies... what are you doing? going through some old letters and documents about the estate. karin... i want us to be friends. i want us to talk to each other. after all, we're sisters. we share so many memories. it's so strange how we never touch, how we only make small talk. why won't you be my friend? we've both been happy and unhappy. we could laugh and cry together. we could talk together for days and nights on end. we could hold each other tight. i sometimes wander through this childhood home of ours, where everything is both strange and familiar... and i feel like i'm in a dream... and like some event of great importance lies in store for us. yes, i'm shallow and childish. you've read and thought and experienced much more than i have. couldn't we use these days to get to know each other and really get closer? i can't bear this distance and silence. did i say something to hurt you? it's easy to do, but i swear i didn't mean to hurt your feelings. what are you reading? - agnes's diary. - what does it say? ""thursday, september 30."" it says... ""i've received the most wonderful gift anyone can receive in this life. it's called many things: togetherness, companionship, affection, tenderness. i think this is what's called 'grace.'"" no, don't touch me! don't come near me! i can't stand to be touched. i don't want you to do that. i don't want you to. i don't want you to be kind to me. no! i can't stand it! it's constant anguish. it's like being in hell. i can't breathe. all the guilt! no! leave me alone. don't touch me. don't touch me. i'm sorry i lost control of myself this morning. i don't know what came over me. i suppose it's all the emotion around agnes's death. we were so fond of her. now that the funeral is over, i'll have our lawyer look after the legal formalities. the fruit please, anna. it's best we sell the house and grounds. you and i can divide up all the rest... furniture, china, pictures, silverware, and books. would you step outside a moment, anna? what shall we do about anna? i suggest we give her a little extra something and let her go. we'll give her some little article of agnes's too. she was very devoted. i understand they were quite close. now she trails after us in much too familiar a manner. i think... it's true. i've... often thought... of taking my own life. it's... it's disgusting. it's degrading... and it never ever changes. henrik's an excellent lawyer, i assure you. my husband says i'm clumsy. he's right. i'm a fumbler. my hands are too big, you see. they just won't obey! you sit there with that embarrassed smile. this isn't the sort of conversation you'd imagined having. do you realize i hate you? do you realize how stupid i find your flirtatiousness and your insipid smiles? how have i put up with you for so long without a word? i see right through you, you and your caresses and your false promises. can you conceive how anyone can live with all the hate i've had to bear? with no mercy or relief or help of any kind. i see it all. nothing escapes me, you hear? now you hear how it sounds when the real karin speaks. you sit there grinning your cold little grin. what are you thinking? would you care to tell me? may i hear madame's opinion? no! just as i thought. you'd rather remain silent. and you're right! forgive me. perhaps you mean well. perhaps you just want to know me better. my dear maria... forgive me. i'm just blabbering. no, that's not true either. maria, look at me. maria, look at me. can't you hear that? someone's crying. can't you hear it? someone's crying and crying. are you afraid of me now? no, i'm not afraid. i'm dead, you see. the trouble is i can't get to sleep. i can't leave all of you. i'm so tired. can't anyone help me? it's just a dream, agnes. no, it's not a dream. perhaps it's a dream for you, but not for me. i want karin to come here. agnes wants karin to come in. won't you hold my hands and warm me? stay with me until the horror is over. it's so empty all around me. no one would do what you ask. i'm still alive. i want nothing to do with your death. perhaps if i loved you... but i don't. what you ask is repulsive. i'm leaving you now. in a few hours i'll be gone. anna. yes. i want maria to come. agnes wants maria to come in. don't be afraid. please touch me. come talk to me. hold my hands and warm me. you're my sister. i won't leave you alone. i feel so incredibly sorry for you. remember when we were little and dusk would fall as we played? we'd suddenly get scared, and we'd huddle together and hold each other tight. it's just like that now, isn't it? i can't hear what you're saying. you have to come closer. closer. hold my hands. i'll stay with you. i'll be here. don't cry. i'm here. you needn't be afraid any longer. i'll take care of her. i have my daughter to think about. she must realize that. my husband needs me. it's repulsive, disgusting, senseless! she's already begun to rot. she has great foul spots on her hands. i'll stay with her. the funeral was tolerable. no one wept or grew hysterical. thank you. have you finished packing? there's one last trunk to bring down, ma'am. hurry. we have little time. the music was nice. the bishop kept it brief, thank god. we're lucky he had a cold so we could cancel the dinner. - shouldn't we do something for anna? - do something? i don't get your meaning. she's looked after agnes for the last 12 years. shouldn't we offer her a small sum or help her find a new place? out of the question. she's young and strong. she's had it very easy. her future is not our responsibility. i did promise she could take a memento. - of her own choosing? - i think she has that right. i detest that sort of spontaneity, but a promise is a promise. we should speak to her right away. anna, you may stay on here for a time if need be. and you were promised a memento of agnes's. thank you. i want nothing at all. she's trying to act noble, but she'll get nothing for it. - stay through the end of the month. - yes. well, if there's nothing left to attend to. let's leave before the roads to the station are snowed under. good-bye, anna. thank you. thank you. thank you for your time here. hurry now. - could i speak to you a second? - of course. that evening we got closer... have you thought about what we discussed? of course. could we hold to all our resolutions? dearest karin, why shouldn't we? i don't know. it's all so different from that evening. i think we've gotten much closer. what are you thinking about? our conversation. no, you're not. i'm thinking how joakim hates it if i keep him waiting. i don't understand why you suddenly demand that i account for all my thoughts. what is it you want? nothing. in that case, don't be hurt if i must say good-bye now. you touched me. don't you remember that? i don't recall every stupid thing i've done, and i won't be made to account for them! dearest karin, give the children my love and keep well. we'll see each other for twelfth night, as usual. how sad. ""wednesday, the third of september. a chill in the air tells of autumn's approach, but the days are still lovely and mild..."" my sisters, karin and maria, have come to see me. it's wonderful to be together again like in the old days. i'm feeling much better. we were even able to take a stroll together. it was a wonderful experience, especially for me, since i haven't been outdoors for so long. we suddenly began to laugh and run toward the old swing that we hadn't used since we were children. we sat in it like three good little sisters, and anna pushed us, slowly and gently. all my aches and pains were gone. the people i'm most fond of in all the world were with me. i could hear them chatting around me. i could feel the presence of their bodies, the warmth of their hands. i wanted to cling to that moment, and i thought... ""come what may, this is happiness. i can't wish for anything better. now, for a few minutes, i can experience perfection, and i feel profoundly grateful to my life, which gives me so much."" thus the cries and whispers fall silent"

""and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed. and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria. and all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth, into judea... unto the city of david, which is called bethlehem... because he was of the house and lineage of david, to be taxed with mary his wife, who was great with child."" - give up? - no! i'm sorry. it's a terrible mess in here. come see us later and you'll get a christmas present. thank you, mrs. ekdahl. now then, children, into bed. hurry up, alexander. to bed now, children. now say your prayers. thank you god for this day. please make me good. may your angel stay by me through the night. god bless papa and mama, grandpapa and grandmama, myself and my brothers and sisters and cousins, uncles and aunts, vega, ester, maj, siri, berta, alida, lisen and uncle isak and everybody else. amen. - good night, alexander. - good night, sweetheart. good night. sleep well. putte kisses like a real man. look at my christmas present. look what mrs. ekdahl gave me. aren't i beautiful? don't i look lovely? i look like a real lady. don't you think? tonight you can't sleep in maj's bed because maj will have a visitor. and i can't just have any number of men in my bed. but you're maj's sweetheart. you know that. well, my dear ones, it's time to say good night. we're getting up early. carlchen! wake up. we're going home. good night, mama. carl's a bit tired. i'll give him a hand. come along now. we're going home. good night. good night, mama. - i stayed behind. - so i noticed. there she lies, the beautiful girl, poor arabella. little does she know what awaits her. she's alone in the whole house. her mother is dead, and her father is carousing with loose companions. who comes there as the clock strikes 12:00 in the castle tower? ""fear seizes me. what is that terrifying white figure floating on the moonbeams and drawing near my bed? it is my dead mother. my mother's ghost."" no more noise in here now! go to sleep, children. good night. i thought i smelled kerosene in the nursery. - kerosene? - yes, kerosene. there's no kerosene lamp in the nursery. well, it smells like it anyway. here we go, isak. i've made some nice strong coffee. much better than vega's awful dishwater. give this a try. what can the time be? ten past 3:00. we can sit for two hours, and then i must change for early service. how good it is to have you here! you're my best friend. whatever would i do without you? last year i enjoyed christmas. this year all i wanted to do was cry. i suppose i'm getting old. do you think i've aged? you've grown older, yes. i thought so. yes, i just wanted to cry. though i love having the grandchildren, of course. i didn't think oscar looked well. he wears himself out with that theater. and the idea of him playing the ghost. he should take it easy. besides, he's an awfully bad actor. i wonder if emilie realizes that he's weak and needs rest. i think i'll have a word with her. he's capable, of course. capable and conscientious. can you believe the theater even makes a small profit? isn't that splendid? a few years ago i contributed a minimum of 50,000 kronor per year. i didn't care, but oscar felt so awkward asking me for money. not like carl. he asked me for a new loan, but i refused. if he comes to you for money, you must say no too. promise me that. - yes, yes. i don't understand it. time and again i clear everything up for him. after a year, he's in dire straits again. he says he doesn't go to moneylenders. do you know? - no. and that poor german woman he's married to. how could he have fallen for her? it must be something erotic. what do you think? erotic? yes, perhaps. - you're not listening. - yes, i am. never mind. the main thing is that you keep me company. carl and gustav adolf are oversexed. they take after their father. he was oversexed. at times i thought it was too much of a good thing, but i never refused. gustav adolf is incorrigible. i've spoken with alma, and she wisely says she doesn't mind his philandering, because he's the kindest husband in the world. it's fortunate that alma is so understanding. perhaps i ought to warn that nursemaid maj, or whatever her name is. i must say she's very pretty, and good with the children. beautiful coloring and a nice figure. pity she limps, the poor thing. are you sad because you've grown old? i'm certainly not. everything's getting worse. worse people, worse machines, worse wars... and worse weather. i'm glad i'll soon be dead. you're an incorrigible old misanthrope and always have been. i don't agree with you. - i thought as much. that doesn't stop me from crying. would you mind if i cry a while? no, upon my soul, i can't. the tears won't come. i'll have to have some more cognac. what are you laughing at? do you remember when we sat there on the sofa kissing madly? you had unbuttoned my blouse, and something else too. then suddenly the curtain was drawn aside, and there stood my dear husband. it was just like a play by feydeau. i screamed and you made for the door. he rushed off to get his pistol, with me hanging on his leg. you became friends for life. your husband was a greathearted man. now i'm weeping. the happy, splendid life is over, and the horrible, dirty life engulfs us. that's the way it is. this won't do. i must wash up and redo my makeup, do my hair and put on my corset and silk dress. a weepy, lovesick woman turns into a self-possessed grandmother. we all play our parts. some play them negligently, others with great care. i'm one of the latter. good night, my lovely helen. you were a sweet lover. like strawberries. you wanted me to help you with your morning toilet, mrs. ekdahl. the time is ten to 5:00. a cafpyidz on castle street. your own cakes and pastries, tarts and confections. what do you say to that, little maj? you'd be in charge of it. just yesterday i said to alma, ""look at maj. she's a princess."" what breasts you have, my girl. let me see properly. you drive me crazy. don't be afraid, child. i'm a wonderful lover. all the women say so. once you get me on my back, you'll forget about the cafpyidz. i swear. give me something to write on. come. come over here. here's a pen. now i'll write: ""maja kling... is the proprietress of my cafpyidz."" signed, gustav adolf ekdahl. christmas night, 1907. there! that's a contract. stick it under a lawyer's nose if i forget my promise. be careful not to put me in the family way. well, what do you say? aren't i nice? ever felt such a wooden leg? damnation! the rocket went off too soon. oh, well, it happens. wasn't it wonderful? you're a real billy goat, sir. and you're my little lamb. i must lie on my back. i'm all in a sweat. i ate and drank too much. - you're not ill? not me! i feel like a bakery ablaze. or should i say cafpyidz? iii? when i'm with such a tasty little morsel? sit on top of me. oh, you're impossible, sir! ride a rocking horse to banbury cross to see a fine lady on a white steed what a glorious time we're having! - my goodness, how your heart's pounding. - i've got a splendid heart. now you'll have to give me a new bed. you'll have a cafpyidz, an apartment, beautiful furniture, and a big bed. - and pretty clothes. - no one will be prettier. you will be gustav adolf's mistress, and i'll come see you every wednesday and saturday at 3:00. how silly you are. - what? - i said you're silly. - silly, am i? - you're a real numbskull. i'm not a numbskull! you are, for imagining i'd want anything from you. don't you want anything? don't you see i was joking? joking? in what way? don't be angry. i'm not, but i don't like being treated like an idiot. stop laughing. - i think you're so funny. i can feel a cold coming on. my throat hurts when i swallow. my teeth are tingling. it's freezing in here. why isn't there any heat? we don't have any credit with the wood merchant. we owe 150 kronor. das weipyidzt du doch. you haven't learned a damn bit of swedish in 23 years. speak swedish! i do my best. last tuesday i asked mama for ten thousand to sort out my affairs. she took out a paper that said i owed her 37,000. it's incredible. - you'll have to go to the jew. - i've already been. i'm paying one hell of an exorbitant interest rate, and if i don't pay on time, he'll show the iou to mama. i have some jewelry. idiot. that would be nice. professor ekdahl running to the pawnbroker. aren't you coming to bed? come, carlchen. come and sit by me. you smell bad. have you given up washing, or are you starting to rot? no. i don't smell bad at all. you have olfactory hallucinations. it's bleeding. - shall i bandage it up? - no. - won't you try and get some sleep? - yes. i feel sorry for you, mein carlchen. how is it one becomes second-rate? can you tell me that? how does the dust fall? when has one lost? first i'm a prince, heir to the kingdom. suddenly, before i know it... i'm deposed. death taps me on the shoulder. the room is cold... and we can't pay for kindling. i'm stupid and unkind. and i'm most unkind... to the only person who cares for me. you can never forgive me. i'm a shit and a cad. if you'd like, i'll make you a hot toddy. don't be so damned servile! wipe your mouth. your lips are always wet. it's disgusting! i don't mean to be unkind. i know that, mein liebling. oh, life! insomnia, poverty and humiliation. stretch out your hand and you grope in the emptiness. why am i such a bloody coward? good night. - good morning, papa. - good morning, petra. don't i get a kiss? - good morning, gustav adolf. - good morning, alma. go and fry three eggs and some ham for papa, and make two cheese sandwiches. what will you drink? - beer. petra, you know where the beer crate is. no, wait, i think there's some stout in the cupboard. would you rather have stout? - yes. don't stand there staring. we have to be at grandma's in an hour. - how do you feel? - cognac. - i've put out your clothes. - thank you. and there's hot water if you want a bath. that would be nice. hurry up now. you're a damned handsome woman. and you're a big shit. - come to bed. - i just did my hair. we'll have a quick one standing up. - petra's coming with breakfast. - we'll lock the door. come on then, but make it quick. - i don't think i can. - you can't? no. there must be something wrong. - you're not sick, are you? - i'm fit as a fiddle. - lie down on the bed. - yes, i guess i could do that. - shall i bring in the breakfast tray? - yes, please. to think that i haven't killed you. now what do you say? well, my friends, it's time. sleeping within my orchard my custom always of the afternoon upon my secure hour thy uncle stole with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial and in the porches of my ears did pour the leperous distilment, whose effect holds such an enmity with blood of man that swift as quicksilver it courses through the natural gates and alleys of the body and with a sudden vigor it doth possess and curd, like eager droppings into milk, the thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine and a most instant tetter bark'd about most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body. oh, horrible, most horrible! if thou hast nature in thee, bear it not. let not the royal bed of denmark be a couch for luxury and damned incest. i've forgotten what i am to do. you get up and exit upstage center. - where am i? - here... at the theater. let's go home and rest. what's happened? you're tired, that's all. shall i call for the ambulance? what am i doing here? you were acting. i was acting? why was i acting? come along, oscar. let's go home. am i going to die now? please help me. i'll get a carriage. he needs his overcoat. alexander, come along. come on. stop! i said stop! hey, you! take the cart behind you! no. no. we know nothing yet. yes, let's hope so. thank you for calling. - how is our dear oscar? - we can only hope. - how is he? - it's a matter of hours. - is he in pain? - he sleeps most of the time. go see ester and vega for hot chocolate and sandwiches. just imagine, children. this letter will go all the way to a mission in china. mr. albrektsson told me his poodle had four puppies. a friend of mine has lived there for 50 years. he wondered if you'd like a puppy. mama won't let us have dogs or cats. - we could keep it here. - really? - yes. - splendid. otherwise it'll be sold. when i was in china, working in the fields with my friend, we had a dog and three cats. - want to play again? - you take red, then. mr. albrektsson makes lots of money on his dogs, but he wants to give this puppy away. he's wealthy in his own right. it's his wife's money, dear ester. would you two like a molasses sandwich? yes, please, miss vega. there, the letter's finished. come, fanny, and i'll let you lick the envelope. - would you like to borrow the flute? - no, thank you. - you want to lick the stamp? - no, thank you. you lick the stamp, then. thank you, sweetheart. leave me alone. come in. your mama asked me to come get you. let's put down the sandwiches. come, alexander. don't be afraid. come here, alexander. come on. i'll wait outside. come here, fanny. tell alexander there's nothing to be afraid of. i'll tell him. i could play the ghost now... really well. nothing. nothing... separates me from all of you. not now... and not later. i know that. i see it... quite clearly. i'll be closer to you now... than when i lived. now i'd like to look at alexander. father says there's nothing to be afraid of. don't be childish now. try to be a good boy. fanny, wake up. you hear that? cock, piss, shit, fart, piss, hell, shit, cock, fart, shit, piss, fart, cock, cunt, damn, hell, crap, ass, piss, cock, butt, pussy. siri, tell the children they may leave the table. yes, ma'am. did you hear something? alexander, wake up! there's something out there. good day, alexander. please give my regards to your mother. hi. what's wrong? someone wishes to talk to you. the hot chocolate will have to wait. - what have i done? - you know quite well. - good day, alexander. - good day. we met once before. under sadder circumstances, when i officiated at your father's funeral. since then, your mother has turned to me with her worries, as is only natural. i am a close friend of your grandmother. i'm the spiritual guide of the parish. the bishop has been very good to me during this difficult time. we've also spoken of you, my son. i've told the bishop how proud i am of my well-behaved children. you and your sister are doing well at school, i'm told. diligent and attentive, and earning good grades. isn't that so, alexander? don't be afraid. i'm your friend and wish you well. you believe me, don't you? but diligence and good grades are not everything in this world. blow your nose, alexander. that's filthy! didn't maj give you a clean handkerchief? yes. goddamn it all! as i said, diligence and good grades aren't everything in this world. listen to the bishop, alexander. i'm sure he is. isn't that so, alexander? you're anxious to know what i'm going to say. you're a big boy now. so i'll talk to you man to man. can you tell me - can you explain to me what a lie is and what the truth is? you think that was a stupid question, and it probably was. i was just kidding with you. of course you know what a lie is and what the truth is, don't you? splendid. splendid, my boy. you also know why one lies. why does one lie? why does one lie? can you explain to me why one lies? because you don't want to tell the truth. a very sly answer, my young friend. but you won't get off so easily. i asked you... why does one not tell the truth? i don't know. we have plenty of time, alexander, and i'm so interested in your answer that i'm prepared to wait indefinitely. you may not believe that, but it's true. one lies to gain an advantage. good answer, my boy. good and concise. forgive me if i ask another question, a bit more personal this time. can you explain to your mother and me why you lied at school? what? your teacher has written to me, saying that you've been spreading the most incredible lies. like what? sold to a circus! do you deny that you told your classmates that i sold you to a traveling circus, and that at the end of the semester they're coming to get you? you are to train as an acrobat and circus rider, together with a gypsy your age named tamara. go to your mother and ask her forgiveness for all the sorrow and worry you've caused her. go to your mother and ask her to forgive you. you hear what i say, don't you? i ask mother's forgiveness for lying, and i promise never to do it again. good, alexander. the matter is resolved and need never be mentioned again. imagination is a splendid thing, a mighty force, a gift from god. it's held in trust for us by the great artists, writers and musicians. i'll get fanny. come, alexander. i have something important to tell you. edvard has asked if i will marry him. i've accepted with gratitude and joy. i've been alone for a long time, and my children need a firm hand. a father. of course, a great deal will be - may god in his mercy take care of our little family. let us kneel down and unite in a heartfelt prayer. may god our father in his mercy take care of our little family and bless us and keep us from evil all the days of our life. god give me strength to be a guardian and a worthy example to these little fatherless ones. give me strength as well to be a support to this ionely young woman. in the 15th century, when this house was built, they didn't bother much about comfort. my predecessors kept it all as it was, and i follow the tradition. these old rooms have an imperishable beauty. we should be grateful that we may live in an atmosphere of purity and austerity. ah, here come my mother and sister. you're already here. welcome, mrs. ekdahl. thank you. this is my sister henrietta. - welcome to the bishop's palace. - thank you. come and say hello, children. this is mrs. tander, our capable cook, who's been with our family for 30 years. this is my future wife, mrs. emilie ekdahl. good day, mrs. ekdahl. welcome. these are our capable helpers: karna, selma and little justina. now we'll go see my aunt, who, alas, is sick and bedridden. how are you today, aunt elsa? we have a visitor. don't be afraid, children. come and say hello. my future wife, mrs. emilie ekdahl, the famous actress. hello, miss bergius. the children have fallen asleep. it's late and we must go home. - not yet. - what is it, edvard? i have a wish. a single wish, but an important one. you may change your mind if you find it impossible. tell me your wish. i want you to come to my house without possessions. what do you mean? i want you to leave your home... your clothes, jewels, furniture... your valuables... your friends, habits and thoughts. i want you to leave your former life entirely. am i to come naked? i'm serious, my dear. i want you to come to your new life as if newly born. - and the children? - the children also. - their toys, dolls, books - - nothing. - i must talk to them. - it's your decision. i can decide for myself, but not for the children. i must ask them. they must sacrifice something for their mother's happiness. you're angry. kiss me. i'm not angry, not in the least. i'll win them over. think it over, emilie. i've already thought it over. for me it's not hard to grant your wish. i've never cared for anything very seriously. i've sometimes wondered if there wasn't something very wrong with my feelings. i couldn't understand why nothing really hurt... why i never felt really happy. i know now that the crucial moment has come. i know that we'll hurt each other, but i'm not afraid. i also know that we will make each other happy. and i sometimes weep from fear, because time is so short, the days pass so quickly, and nothing lasts forever. kiss me, now, and hold me in your arms, as only you can. i, olof henrik edvard vergerus... take thee, elisabet emilie josefin ekdahl... to be my wedded wife... to love you for better and for worse... and as a symbol of this love i give you this ring. i, elisabet emilie josefin ekdahl... take thee, olof henrik edvard vergerus, to be my wedded husband... to love you for better and for worse... and as a symbol of this love i take this ring. in the name of god the father, son and holy ghost. amen. for as much as you have consented in holy wedlock... i wonder if this is a good thing. you saw how happy she was. - i'm thinking of the children. - they'll get used to it, dear mama. he's a devil of a lady killer, the bishop is. you don't know that for sure, carl. i don't know why i just want to cry. they should have taken a honeymoon. i invited them to our house in provence, but emilie refused. that's not so strange. she has great respect for her new husband. he's a handsome man, whatever you say. - i expect he has false teeth. - petra, don't be silly. his mother was nice. they say the sister's a bitch. i've a feeling we'll have emilie back... quite soon. the children don't appear to have an appetite. everything's new and strange to them. you must understand, henrietta. perhaps they're turning up their noses at the food. let's be happy on our first evening together. i have no desire to spoil it, but in the future - yes, i might as well mention it now. in the future no one may leave the table without having eaten up - dearest henrietta, i'll tell my children what to do. there's a basic rule in this house which no one must break, not even you, dear emilie, and that is respect for the temporal gifts. i think you've misunderstood an essential point, dearest henrietta. but i suggest we postpone this discussion to a more suitable time. forgive me, dear emilie. i am forgetting myself. i'm sure you're a more capable housewife than i. i'll ask your advice in all things. edvard has admonished me a hundred times. it's not easy to realize one has become superfluous! that will do, henrietta. perhaps i may be allowed to share that we are early risers in this house, both weekdays and sundays. at 6:00 we gather for morning prayers in edvard's study. i'd also like to mention that we make our own beds and tidy our rooms. in this house, punctuality, cleanliness and order are the rule. don't be alarmed, children. my daughter makes it sound worse than it actually is. we'll start out very gently. i'm not sure i understand. if you mean to apply a new method of upbringing - not at all, dear emilie. i'm convinced that the children will soon realize how fun it is to perform one's duties conscientiously. it's all to be like a game. my children don't care for that sort of game, and neither do i. time will tell, dear emilie. they're coming now. into bed, both of you! now we'll say our prayers. thank you, god, for this day. please make me good. may your angel stay by me through the night. god bless papa and mama and grandpapa and grand - and uncle edvard. and uncle edvard, myself and my brothers and sisters and cousins, uncles and aunts, vega, ester, maj, siri, berta, alida, lisen, and uncle isak and everybody else. amen. good night, alexander. justina, i'd like to speak to you about tomorrow. what's that book you're reading, alexander? what's that book you're reading, alexander? good night, my boy. good night, my child. god bless you. good night, uncle edvard. my dearest wish is for us to live at peace with one another. love cannot be commanded, but we can show respect and consideration. you go ahead, my dear. i'll come later. whose doll house is this? fifteen years ago, two little girls lived in this room. they drowned in the river with their mother. - perhaps the house is haunted. - there are no such things as ghosts. - did they live in this room? - i think this was the nursery. good night. sleep well. i think we've got a terrible stepfather. and the sister is crazy. and that tub of lard that has to be fed. i don't want to live here. you have to give me time. much has to be changed. some things will go quickly, others will take time. the main thing is not to lose heart. why did you marry the bishop? because i love him. now let us sleep. things will seem better when we're not so tired. don't play hamlet, my son. i'm not queen gertrude, your kind stepfather isn't the king of denmark, and this is not elsinore castle, even if it does look rather gloomy. hell and damnation. come, fanny. i'll show you something. the windows are barred. they can't be opened. fannyand alexander will continue in a moment fannyand alexander will now continue yes, oscar, that's how it is. one is old and a child at the same time. what became of those long years in between that seemed so important at the time? may i take your hand? i remember your hand as a child. it was small and firm and dry. and your wrist was so awfully slender. i enjoyed being a mother. i enjoyed being an actress, too, but i preferred being a mother. i liked having a big belly, and i didn't give two shakes about the theater then. it's all acting anyway. some roles are nice, others not so nice. i played a mother. i played juliet and margareta. then suddenly i played a widow or a grandmother. one role follows the other. the thing is not to shrink from them. but what became of it all? can you tell me that, my boy? you're a good boy to listen to your old mother's soliloquies, as isak calls them. yes, you're a good boy, oscar... and i grieved terribly when you past away. that was a strange role to play. my feelings came from deep in my body. even though i could control them... they shattered reality, if you know what i mean. reality has remained broken ever since... and, oddly enough, it feels more real that way. so i don't bother to mend it. i just don't care anymore if nothing makes sense. oscar, my dear boy? - yes, mama. - are you sad? i'm worried. about the children? yes. supper time. then you are to go straight to bed. the tray can be left until tomorrow. mrs. tander sent some cookies for you. i'll be upset if miss vergerus finds out i gave these to you. hasn't mother returned? no, your mother has not returned. she said she'd be back this evening. oh, dear, i don't know what to say. why do you keep sighing like that? i haven't been in this house long, thank goodness... but mrs. tander, who's been here since the first wife, could tell you a thing or two. would you like a cookie? - yes, thank you. - what does mrs. tander say? that it was the same in the first wife's day. only worse. poor children. - you mean us? no, i don't mean you. i mean the poor little ones who found their grave in the dark river outside. their mother tried to save them, but she was pulled down by the current. they found them later by the bridge. they clung tightly to each other as if they were one big body. the arms had to be sawn off to get the bodies into separate coffins. mrs. tander says that since then, it has never been quiet in this house. there are no ghosts. i don't mean to frighten you... but this house does funny things to you. look at my hand. skin's been completely ripped off, stripped down to the flesh. i was taking his grace his coffee. when i grabbed the doorknob, the skin stuck and ripped off. someone laughed behind me. i heard it clearly and turned around. but there was no one there. i feel sorry for anyone who - i shouldn't chatter on like this. i'll keep quiet. i'll close the door now. don't worry. your mother will probably be back tomorrow, and his grace will personally release you from captivity. - i've seen them. - who? the woman and the children. is that the truth? are you telling the truth, alexander? word of honor as a swedish citizen. where did you see them? i had been in the library with that man who married my mother. he'd been lecturing me. i don't remember why. i was passing through the dining room... and it was unusually bright. then i saw a little girl in the doorway. she ran past me without a sound. then i saw the older girl, with the dark hair and big eyes. she stopped and looked at me and motioned to me to turn around. and there in the bright sunlight... stood the woman in her black dress. she said in a faint, almost inaudible voice... not to be afraid, that she had something to tell me. what did she say? i don't want to frighten anyone, but these were her very words: ""i want you to know our secret. your stepfather, my husband, locked me and my children in the bedchamber. for five days and nights he kept us without food and water. in our misery we decided to escape. we tied sheets together and tried to climb down to the finger of land sticking out into the deep, swirling water. my daughters went first, but they fell headfirst into the water and were dragged under. i tried to save them but was sucked down into a black whirlpool that grabbed my clothes. underwater i grasped my children's hands and drew them to me."" why, it's maj! how nice. come in, dear child. i hope i'm not disturbing you. not at all. give me a kiss. that's nice. very pretty. did you make it yourself? yes. a pretty pattern. so you didn't go on the excursion? no, i wouldn't fit in the boat with my big belly. nonsense. is something wrong? - i'm silly to worry. let's sit here. you're worried about the children? alexander and i agreed to write. i've written seven letters. and you've received no reply? one postcard three weeks ago. ""dear maj. we are well. uncle edvard took us to..."" the botanical gardens. ""we learned about rare flowers."" ""thank you for your letters. i'll write when i get some time. love from alexander. fanny sends her love."" we mustn't underestimate emilie. she's perfectly capable of looking after her children. we're worrying for no reason. i came to the family before fanny was born. they're my children too. you're going already? i wanted to speak with you, since i knew you were alone. stay a moment. thank you for your kindness, but i promised to have dinner ready when they came home. i haven't put the steak in the oven yet. dear child, are things that bad? yes. - is it the cafpyidz? - that too. has gustav adolf been pestering you? i don't want to hurt him. he's so kind. what worries me most is the children. i'm sorry to be crying. i'm behaving badly. forgive me. mrs. tander wants to know if your grace will have supper alone. tell her i don't want any supper. a glass of milk and a sandwich in my room will be sufficient. thank you, sir. i'll tell her. was there something else? i don't know. i don't know how to say it. it's so unpleasant. it might seem - well? sir, i can't stand here in the doorway. come in, then, and close the door. you said i was to keep an eye on the children, listen to their conversation and tell you of anything unusual. well? alexander made up a terrible story. really? it was about - oh, it's so awful i don't know how to get it out. he says you locked your first wife up, and she was drowned with her children when they tried to escape. - that's all, sir. - you can go. who's there? it's just me. get up. your stepfather wants to talk to you. get dressed. your stepfather wants to talk to you. hurry up! alexander, my boy. in the presence of your sister and justina you have accused me of having murdered my wife and children. what? justina, please repeat what you told me. alexander said he had seen your first wife and children. she spoke to him and said that the bishop had locked them all up without food and water. on the fifth day they tried to escape but drowned in the attempt. - do you recognize the story? - no. - so justina has given false testimony? - she could have dreamt it. justina, are you prepared to confirm your statement under oath? yes, your grace. good, justina. fanny, did you hear alexander's story? no. so you maintain that justina was either lying or dreaming? yes. please come here, alexander. are you prepared to swear to it? of course. it's a mortal sin to swear falsely. it's called perjury and is severely punished. really? lay your hand on the bible and say after me: ""i, alexander ekdahl... swear by holy writ and by the living god... that all i have said, say and will say... is the whole truth and nothing but the truth."" alexander, my boy. you remember that the two of us had an important conversation about a year ago. it concerned certain moral questions. it wasn't really a conversation. what do you mean? the bishop spoke and alexander said nothing. and felt ashamed, perhaps, on account of your lies. i've grown wiser since then. you mean you lie better. more or less. i don't know what you imagine. do you think you can besmirch another person's honor with impunity? i think the bishop hates alexander. that's what i think. oh, so that's what you think. i'll tell you something that may come as a surprise. i don't hate you. i love you. but the love i feel for you and your mother and sister is not blind and sloppy. it is strong and harsh. do you hear what i say? - no. you're hardening your heart. moreover, you misjudge the situation. i am much stronger than you are. - i don't doubt it. i mean stronger spiritually. because i have truth and justice on my side. i know you'll confess in a little while. your confession and punishment will be a relief to you. you're a wise little man, alexander. you realize that the game is up... but you are proud and stubborn... and of course you are ashamed. i've forgotten what i'm to confess. have you now. what does the bishop want alexander to confess? you know i have means at my disposal. i didn't, but i do now. in my childhood, parents were not so softhearted. they had the cane. i have one too. it's an ordinary carpet beater, but it can dance a fine step! if that didn't work, we had other effective means, namely castor oil. there you see the bottle and a glass. a few mouthfuls of this and you're more docile. if that didn't help, there was a dark and cold cubbyhole where you sat for a few hours until the rats started sniffing at your face. why must i be punished? that is obvious, my boy. you have a weakness in your character. you can't distinguish lies from truth. so far they are just child's lies, however dreadful they may be. but soon you will be a grown man, alexander, and life punishes liars ruthlessly and indiscriminately. the punishment is to teach you a love of truth. i confess i made it up about locking your wife and children in. - do you also confess to perjury? - i suppose so. now you've won a great victory. a victory over yourself. which punishment do you choose? cane, castor oil or the dark cubbyhole? - how many strokes of the cane? - ten. then i choose the cane. take two cushions and put them on the table. pull your pants down. bend over. stand up. - you have something to say to me. - no. you must ask my forgiveness. i won't. then i must cane you until you think better of it. can't you spare us both that unpleasant experience? i'll never apologize. you won't apologize? no. bend over. no more, please! will you ask forgiveness now? yes. button your pants and blow your nose. lend him a handkerchief, justina. what do you have to say now? alexander asks the bishop for forgiveness. speak up. i want everyone to hear your regret. alexander asks the bishop for forgiveness. for the lies and the perjury. you do understand that i punished you out of love? yes! kiss my hand, alexander. - may i go to bed now? - yes, you may. but so that you may contemplate the day's events in peace and quiet... you're to sleep in the attic. justina will provide a mattress and a blanket. at 6:00 in the morning you will be let out. understood? yes, your grace! i must go. a carriage is waiting at the gate. i'm afraid something might have happened while i've been here. i'm in constant fear that alexander will say something to displease him. alexander is so foolhardy. i've tried to warn him, but he can't see that his stepfather is a dangerous opponent who's just waiting for the right opportunity to crush him. you must leave him, emilie. i'm pregnant. nevertheless, you must - forgive me for interrupting. i've asked him for a divorce. he refuses. i tell him that i'll leave just the same. then he explains in detail what will happen. in a court of law, i'll lose on grounds of ""desertion,"" as it's called. the children will be taken from me, to be brought up by him. i've written in secret to a friend of mine who's a lawyer. he's confirmed what edvard says. i am shut in and can no longer breathe. i'm dying, helena! i hate that man so violently that i could - don't mention that i've been here. to anybody. - give me the key! - edvard has forbidden it. give me the key now! edvard has forbidden it! you're hurting me! emilie, you can't! take your damn paint box! listen to me. i told you, there's none left. we're to go up to see grandmama. i'm just shouting! punch will do just as well! the old girl's not here. she's probably in the dining room. good evening, mama. we came to see how you are. i'm splendid. i hope you aren't ionely. lonely? i love being alone. vega was bitten by a wasp. a wasp stings, my dear. it has a stinger just like your old man. don't pinch me. and petra fell in the lake and got soaked. where shall i serve supper? i don't want any. - how's the wasp sting? - not worth talking about. and mama is busy with the old man's photographs. how many thousands have you sorted by now? here's one of you and your brothers. you couldn't have been more than five years old. - you can already tell which brother - - who is this beautiful woman? did it rain on you the whole time? no, not at all, dearest mama. not a cloud over the outer islands, but we saw the rain over the mainland, and heard the thunder it's rained all day here. this woman with the low neckline was one of papa's lady friends. you're mistaken. we were at school together. she married a count, had 12 children and became as big as a house. i always admired your skillful way of handling papa's little adventures. we must be going. mr. pyidzhman and his lovely wife are going to stop by. i'm going into town tomorrow. anything i can do for you? thank you, gusten. i don't need anything. but i'd like to talk to you about maj. what the hell is it now? she's got it good. now i'm damned angry - if you'll excuse me, mama. calm down, gusten! he loses his temper at the mention of maj's name. i just want to say - you have to realize maj is not your private plaything. thanks to alma's broad-mindedness, she's a member of our family, and she's expecting my grandchild. in your dictatorial way, you've decided her future. i don't give a damn - i don't like it when you swear in your mother's presence. you hear me, gusten? i like the girl. i wish her well. i want to ensure her future. i don't want her to be dependent on the family's benevolence if i die. she's accepted my suggestions. she doesn't need any protectors, especially against me. stop your twaddle! don't make me out as a dictator! maj has decided it all herself! i like her. i'm kind to her. alma's kind to her. now i'm hurt, let me tell you. damned hurt! there's no reason to side with maj against me! i'm fond of her. alma's fond of her. she is loved in the same way as jenny, petra and putte. well, not exactly in the same way, but almost. she's good to me. she doesn't think i'm fat and old and disgusting. nobody thinks that, by the - i've a soft spot for the ladies. what's to be done about it? that's nothing to giggle at. maj is to go her own way through life, and i'm going to give her solid ground to stand on. that's enough said about that. the opera singer said he would stop by with his wife and children. come now. good-bye, mama. give me a kiss. i don't want you and alma to sit gossiping about maj's future. i'll see to that! or rather, she will. good night, mama. come, alma. - i'll be back in a couple of hours. - like hell you will! come on! calm down or you'll have a stroke. i am calm. you're the one who's shouting. i want an end to all that gossip between you and mama! good day, mr. jacobi. good day, miss vergerus. what is it? is his grace - he is not to be disturbed. may i speak to his wife? she is indisposed, resting in her room - and not to be disturbed. my mother is out and i am busy. his grace might be annoyed if - what is this concerning? some months ago, his grace proposed a business deal. really? i don't recall. of course not, miss vergerus. his grace is careful to spare his family such trivial worries. what worries of his could concern you? please don't force me to be vulgar. to be candid, mr. jacobi, i find you unpleasant. i've neither the time nor the inclination to speak with you. good-bye, mr. jacobi. - a pecuniary predicament. i beg your pardon? your brother, his grace, was in a pecuniary predicament. may i sit down? - not there! there. in a peculiar way - i don't know why - i appreciate your straightforwardness. and i do not appreciate your fawning. what business do you have with my brother? none at all, as far as i know. i'm tired of your riddles. tell me what's on your mind and go. i must speak to his grace first. it's a matter of money. a lot of money. does my brother owe you money? on the contrary. it's like this: in november his grace wanted to borrow money. regrettably, jews have certain principles, like never lending money to the clergy. he suggested i should buy that chest for a reasonable sum. i declined. so you declined. foolishly so, since i've now changed my mind. i'd like to buy that chest, and at almost any price. almost. i will get my brother. i told you not to disturb me. mr. jacobi wants to buy the chest. that man hangs on like vermin! stay where you are. i'll come get you in a few minutes. take your shoes off. forgive an old man's unfortunate weakness, your grace. - you wish to buy the chest? - yes. for how much? here is the sum. it seems you've changed your mind. i may have an interested buyer. - i'm being cheated, of course. - you're free to say no. - do you have you the money with you? - the money? the money! of course, your grace. i have large bills right here. let me see. yes, here they are. - give me the money. - of course. if i may have your grace's name on the contract? forgive me if i retire. i shall miss you, miss vergerus. do not take anything that is not your due. suspicions recoil on those who harbor them. your grace will want to ensure that i'm not taking more than my due. that's quite all right. i just wanted to return the signed contract. please have a seat. what would you say about that painting? a beautiful and valuable work. would it interest you? my resources are regrettably a bit strained at present. how is your wife? - it's kind of you to inquire. she is indisposed. this sudden heat disagrees with her. - may i pay my respects? - unfortunately not. i understand. here is a letter for her from old mrs. ekdahl. - i shall give it to her. - you're too kind. filthy jewish swine! you damned, filthy jewish swine! you thought you could cheat me. you'll regret this, you repulsive, hooknosed bastard! calm down! that swine is trying to steal my children! he can't. i have the key to the nursery. don't touch them! come here. first and foremost, let's have something to eat. this is my nephew, aron. let's go to the table. i'd like to sleep. our guests are tired. have you tidied the room and made the beds? i've done all you asked, uncle. this is aron's puppet theater. if you ask him nicely, he may give a performance. behind this door lives my nephew ismael. he's sick. the door must always be kept shut. remember that, both of you. sometimes he sings, even at night. it's nothing to worry about. you'll get used to it. this will be your home for the time being. i hope you'll like it. go to bed now. good night, fanny. good night, alexander. lock the door at night and don't open it for anyone. don't forget to say your prayers. - don't go. you want me to stay? then i'll sit here. i'll go and see to ismael. my name is aron. ismael is my brother. our parents died when we were small. i have to pee. damn, there's no chamber pot. it won't be easy to find the toilet in the dark. i hope there aren't any ghosts. damn, i think i've lost my way. now i'm lost for sure. it's not my fault it's all gone wrong. i can't leave you. i just can't. i would be better if you'd take off for heaven. you can't help us anyway. i lived my whole life with you children and emilie. death makes no difference. what is it, alexander? why can't you go to god and tell him to kill the bishop? or doesn't god give a damn about you, or any of us? have you even seen god on the other side? not a bastard has a thought in his head. idiots, the whole bunch of 'em. you must be gentle with people. aren't you coming to bed? the clock has struck 4:00. i can't sleep. neither can i. elsa's very sick. we ought to send for the doctor. he's coming in the morning. what are you drinking? - hot broth. it helps against insomnia. - may i? be my guest. can't you forgive me? i'm staying with you, aren't i? i don't understand this sudden yielding. drink while it's hot. - you insist that the children return? - yes. in that case, it's hopeless. i don't care if it's hopeless. i care only for what is right. isn't that elsa calling? stay here. i'll see to her. can i help you, aunt? it's so dark. what time is it? almost half past 4:00. it's been a long night. try to get some sleep. my legs hurt. they're swollen and aching. you once said you were always changing masks... until finally you didn't know who you were. i have only one mask. but it's branded into my flesh. if i tried to tear it off - i always thought people liked me. i saw myself as wise, broad-minded and fair. i had no idea... that anyone could hate me. i don't hate you. no, but your son does. i'm afraid of him. who's behind the door? it is god behind the door. - can't you come out? - no living being may see god's face. - what do you want? - to prove that i exist. this is the end of me. shall i show myself? now you will see me. here i come, alexander. - admit you were scared. - i wasn't a damned bit scared. ""this is the end of me."" ouch! that hurts. don't cry. i didn't mean to scare you. at least not that much. i've been working all night on this puppet. a rich circus owner in england is mad about our puppets. i heard you tiptoeing around. hear that? my brother ismael is awake. he's singing. poor ismael. human beings are more than he can bear. sometimes he gets furious. then he's dangerous. you said you'd been up all night, but i saw you asleep. there are many strange things that can't be explained. you realize that when you dabble in magic. have you seen our mummy? - no. come. look carefully, alexander. can you see it breathing? it's been dead 4,000 years, but it breathes. i'll make the room dark. - what do you see? - it's shining. exactly. no one knows why it's luminous. no one can explain why. the unknown makes people angry. it's better to blame it on mirrors, machines and projections. then people laugh, and that's healthier from all viewpoints, especially financially. watch carefully now. uncle isak says we're surrounded by different realities, one on top of the other. there are swarms of ghosts, spirits, phantoms, souls, poltergeists, angels and demons. he says the smallest pebble has a life of its own. more coffee? - yes, please. everything is alive, and everything is god or god's thought. not only good things, but the cruelest too. what do you think? if there is a god, then he's a shit, and i'd like to kick him in the butt. your theory is very interesting and appears to be justified. shall we take ismael his breakfast? i've brought your breakfast. your sister gave me sleeping pills for my insomnia. i had put three in the broth. i didn't mean for you to drink it. when you went to see elsa, i put in three more. you will sleep soundly. when you wake up, i will be gone. i'm going back to my children... to my home... and my family. i'll change and you'll come back. i'll never come back! i'll poison your life! i'll follow you from town to town! i'll ruin your children's future! poor edvard, you don't know what you're saying! i am awake! i'm horribly awake. help me into bed at least. i can't see anymore... and i feel dizzy. are you there? i can't see. ismael, i've brought your breakfast. good morning, ismael. this is alexander ekdahl, a friend. leave us alone, aron. don't worry. i won't eat him... even if he does look appetizing. you can come back in half an hour. go now, aron. - uncle isak - uncle isak is an old goat and needn't know of alexander's visit. go now. no, thank you. my name is ismael, but you already know that. ""and he will be a wild man. his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him."" i'm considered dangerous. that's why i'm locked up. dangerous in what way? write your name here. the pencil's pretty dull, but it should still serve. there, alexander ekdahl. now read what you've written. it says ""ismael retzinsky."" perhaps we're the same person, with no boundaries. perhaps we flow through each other, stream through each other boundlessly and magnificently. you bear such terrible thoughts... it's almost painful to be near you. yet it's also enticing. do you know why? - i don't think i want to know. you've heard of making an image of someone you dislike and sticking pins in it? it's a rather clumsy method when you think of the swift paths an evil thought can travel. you're a strange little person. you won't speak of that which is constantly in your thoughts. you're thinking of a man's death. wait a moment. i know who you're thinking of: a tall man with fair, graying hair. correct me if i'm wrong. he has clear blue eyes and a boyish face. correct me if i'm wrong. he's asleep and dreams he's kneeling at the altar. above the altar hangs the crucified prophet. in his dream he gets up and cries out, ""my god, my god, why hast thou forsaken me?"" there is no answer, not even a laugh. don't talk like that. it is not i talking. it is yourself. you are not to hesitate. he's sound asleep, plagued by nightmares. give me your hands. it isn't really necessary, but it's safer. the doors will be thrown open. a scream will echo through the house. - i don't want to. - it's too late. you have only one way to go, and i am with you. i obliterate myself. i merge into you, my child. don't be afraid. i am with you. i'm your guardian angel. it is 5:00 in the morning, and the sun has just risen. the doors are thrown open. no, wait. first a horrible scream echoes through the house. a shapeless burning figure moves across the floor, screaming. i don't want to. let me go! let me go! the police are here and insist on speaking to you. your husband, his grace the bishop, lost his life this morning under terrible circumstances. may i, madam? we think we've been able to determine the course of events. miss elsa bergius, who was gravely ill, lay in bed. on her bedside table stood a lamp. by some unfortunate accident, the lamp fell on the bed igniting her nightgown, hair and bed linens. blazing like a torch, she ran through the house and by chance made it into the bishop's bedchamber. according to his grace's sister, miss henrietta vergerus, he was in a heavy sleep from a soporific you had given him earlier that night. miss bergius flung herself on him, igniting his bedclothes and nightshirt. his grace woke up and succeeded in freeing himself from the dying woman who was still ablaze. but he could not extinguish the flames that were now engulfing him. old mrs. vergerus found her son with his body burnt and face charred. he showed faint signs of life and said he was in unbearable agony. although i can't overlook the fact that the sleeping aid you gave him possibly made the disaster worse, i also cannot attach any serious importance to it. therefore, i must characterize the event as an ill-fated coincidence of extremely unfortunate circumstances. my dear, dear friends. i am more moved than i can say. my wisdom is simple. there are those who despise it, but i don't give a damn - forgive me, mama. i noticed you raised your right eyebrow. you think your son is talking too much. don't worry. i will be brief. therefore... and consequently... we ekdahls have not come into the world to see through it. never think that. we are not equipped for such excursions. we might just as well ignore the big things. we must live in the little world. we will be content with that and cultivate it and make the best of it. suddenly death strikes. suddenly the abyss opens. suddenly the storm howls, and disaster is upon us. all that we know. but let us not think of all that unpleasantness. we ekdahls love our subterfuges. rob a man of his subterfuges and he goes mad and begins lashing out. damn it all, people must be intelligible! otherwise we don't dare to love them or speak ill of them. we must be able to grasp the world and reality so we can complain of their monotony with a clear conscience. don't be sad, dear splendid artists. actors and actresses, we need you all the same. it is you who must give us our supernatural shivers, or better yet, our innermost diversions. the world is a den of thieves and night is falling. evil breaks its chains and runs through the world like a mad dog. the poison affects us all, us ekdahls and everyone else. no one escapes, not even helena viktoria or little aurora. so it shall be. therefore let us be happy while we are happy. let us be kind, generous, affectionate and good. it is necessary, and not at all shameful... to take pleasure in the little world. good food... gentle smiles... fruit trees in bloom, waltzes. my dearest friends, i'm done talking, and you can take it as you like: the sentimental ramblings of an uneducated restaurateur or the pitiful babbling of an old man. i don't care. i hold a little empress in my arms. it's tangible yet immeasurable. one day she will prove everything i just said wrong. one day she will not only rule the little world, but everything. everything. there, there, my child. be a good girl now, so that mama can go to bed. i think you've finished eating, in any case. - i'll take her. - thank you, rosa. - how do you like it here? - everyone's so kind. especially mr. ekdahl. he must be a real friend of humanity. that he certainly is. he's particularly kind to young girls, so you watch out, rosa. oh, my! - good night, madam. - good night, rosa. come along, you're tired. i'm wide awake. we're going to have champagne. oh, no, we're not. we're going to bed. we're going to have champagne. if you're a good boy, i'll bring you a beer and sandwich in bed. i'm sure emilie will want a glass of champagne. we'll raise a toast to our daughters. go to bed now, gusten. i'm so damned happy! that's nice, gusten, but you'll have a headache tomorrow. imagine: we're together again. i'm going to the country tomorrow to speak with the workmen. do you need anything taken care of? i'll be there until thursday. - i'll come on tuesday. don't you think i have the best wife in the world? much better than you deserve. and the world's prettiest little mistress. a real darling. - are you going in the morning? - not until 2:00. when i see you, i want to weep with joy. to think you're back with us again! - good night, gusten. - good night. be a good boy now, and remember that alma needs her sleep. i know what alma needs. aunt emilie. - what do you two want at this hour? - we want to move to stockholm. marianne egerman is opening a boutique and wants us to help. - and we'd like to. - we'd very much like to. but we have a big problem. papa insists on that cafpyidz for maj. he's so kind. - maj's had enough of his tutelage. - he's so kind. she wants to live her own life and decide for herself and her baby. i don't know what to do. we've spoken to mama. she was awfully upset at first and said we couldn't do that to papa. then she calmed down and said that life must take its course... and that one shouldn't force one's children. though she felt sorry for papa's sake. it's awful. you must think of yourself. after all, papa's an old man. isn't that true, aunt emilie? go to bed now. i'll have a word with grandmama. emilie, how nice to see you! welcome! i need to speak with you. - would you like a cognac? - no, thank you. is it anything serious? oh, yes. maj and petra want to move to stockholm. what do you think? you can't escape me. one other thing. you're right. on his deathbed, oscar asked you to take charge of the theater. i was there. i remember it well. gustav adolf will be awfully hurt. why all this concern for gustav adolf? he has a good head for business, but he doesn't know a thing about theater. it's your theater, my dear emilie. it's about time we explain to our backwoods napoleon that he's facing his waterloo. i'd like you to read a new play by august strindberg. that nasty misogynist! no, thank you. it's called a dream play. i thought we'd both perform in it. not on your life. i haven't appeared on stage in - all the more reason. i won't disturb you any longer. you never disturb me. what are you laughing at? now we're the ones in charge, aren't we? do you think so? - good night, dearest. - good night, my dear.

Bergman,Persona,"you wished to speak to me, doctor? have you seen mrs. vogler yet, sister alma? no, not yet. let me explain her situation and why you've been hired to care for her. mrs. vogler is an actress, as you know. in the middle of her last performance of electra, she fell silent and looked around as if in surprise. she was silent for over a minute. she apologized to her colleagues afterward, saying she'd felt a sudden urge to laugh. the next day the theater called to ask if she'd forgotten about rehearsal. the maid went in her room and found her still in bed. she was awake but wouldn't answer questions or move. this condition's gone on for three months now. she's been given every conceivable test. the result is clear: she's perfectly healthy, both mentally and physically. and it's not a question of some hysterical reaction either. any questions, sister alma? if not, you can go see mrs. vogler now. hello, mrs. vogler. i'm sister alma. i've been hired to take care of you for a while. perhaps i should tell you a bit about myself. i'm 25 years old, and i'm engaged. i got my nursing certificate two years ago. my parents have a farm in the country. my mother was a nurse too, before she got married. i should go get your dinner tray... fried liver and fruit salad. it looked quite good. shall i raise this end up? are you all right like that? sister alma, what's your first impression? i don't know what to say, doctor. at first her face looks soft, almost childish, but then you see her eyes... her expression's so hard. perhaps i shouldn't... what were you going to say? i was thinking i should turn down the assignment. why? did something frighten you? no, not exactly, but perhaps mrs. vogler should have an older nurse, one with more life experience. i might not be able to manage. - manage? in what way? - mentally. - mentally? if she's made a conscious decision not to speak or move, which must be the case, since she's healthy... then? then that shows great mental strength. i may not be up to it. i thought you might want to see the twilight. i can draw the curtains later. shall i turn on the radio? i think there's a play on. forgive me, darling. you must forgive me. all i want is your forgiveness. what are you laughing about? is the actress so funny? what do you know of mercy? well? what do you know of mercy? i don't understand those sorts of things. i enjoy films and the theater, but i'm afraid i don't go very often. i have tremendous admiration for artists. i think art is enormously important in life, especially for those struggling for one reason or another. but i'm skating on thin ice, telling you about such things. let's see if i can find some music. is that all right? good night, then. sleep well. damn it. it's funny. you can go about as you please... doing almost anything you please. i'll marry karl-henrik and we'll have a couple kids, whom i'll raise. it's all decided. it's inside me. i don't even have to think about it. it's a great feeling of security. i have a job i like and enjoy. that's good too... but in another way. but it's good. yes... it's good. i wonder what's really wrong with her. elisabet vogler. mrs. vogler, would you like me to open the letter? shall i read it? shall i read it to you? ""dearest elisabet, since i'm not allowed to see you, i'm writing instead. if you don't wish to read my letter, you can ignore it. but i can't help trying to contact you this way, as i'm tormented by a persistent question: have i done you harm in some way? have i unknowingly hurt you somehow? was there some terrible misunderstanding between us?"" should i really go on? ""as far as i know, we've been happy recently. surely we've never been... so close. do you remember saying, 'i'm only just beginning to understand what it means to be married'? 'you've taught me...'"" i can't make it out. ""'you've taught...'"" now i see. ""'you've taught me that we must see each other as two anxious children full of goodwill and the best of intentions but gov...'"" now i see. ""'...governed by forces we can only partially control.' do you remember saying all that? we were walking in the woods, and you stopped and grabbed the belt of my coat..."" there was a picture with the letter. a picture of your son. i don't know if... do you want it, mrs. vogler? he looks awfully cute. elisabet, i don't think there's any point in your staying here in the hospital. it's just hurting you to be here. since you don't want to go home, i suggest you and sister alma move out to my summer place by the sea. you think i don't understand? the hopeless dream of being. not seeming to be, but being. conscious and awake at every moment. at the same time, the chasm between what you are to others and what you are to yourself. the feeling of vertigo, and the constant hunger to be unmasked once and for all. to be seen through, cut down... perhaps even annihilated. every tone of voice a lie, every gesture a falsehood, every smile a grimace. commit suicide? no, too nasty. one doesn't do things like that. but you can refuse to move or talk. then at least you're not lying. you can cut yourself off, close yourself in. then you needn't play any roles, wear any masks, make any false gestures. so you might think... but reality plays nasty tricks on you. your hiding place isn't watertight enough. life oozes in from all sides. you're forced to react. no one asks whether it's genuine or not, whether you're lying or telling the truth. questions like that only matter in the theater, and hardly even there. i understand you, elisabet. i understand that you're not speaking or moving, that you've turned this apathy into a fantastic setup. i understand and admire you. i think you should play this part until it's played out, until it's no longer interesting. then you can drop it, just as you eventually drop all your other roles. thus, at the end of the summer, mrs. vogler and sister alma move out to the doctor's summer house. the stay by the sea agrees very well with the actress. her crippling apathy at the hospital gives way to long walks, fishing excursions, cooking, letter writing, and other diversions. sister alma enjoys the seclusion of the countryside and tends to her patient with utmost care. don't you know it's bad luck to compare hands? elisabet... may i read you something from my book? or am i disturbing you? here's what it says: ""all the anxiety we carry within us, all our thwarted dreams, the inexplicable cruelty, our fear of extinction, the painful insight into our earthly condition have slowly crystallized our hope for an other-worldly salvation. the tremendous cry of our faith and doubt against the darkness and silence is the most terrifying proof of our abandonment and our unuttered knowledge."" do you think that's true? i don't believe that. to change... but i'm so lazy. and then i feel guilty about it. karl-henrik scolds me for not having any ambition, for going around like i'm sleepwalking. i think that's unfair. i graduated highest in my class. but maybe he means something else. you know... oh, sorry. you know what i think about sometimes? at the hospital where i took my exam, there's a home for old nurses who were nurses all their lives and lived for their work and were always in uniform. they live in their little rooms there. imagine believing so strongly in something that you devote your entire life to it. having something to believe in, working at something, believing your life has meaning. i like that. holding on tight to something, no matter what... i think that's how it should be. meaning something to other people. don't you agree? i know it sounds childish, but i believe in that. what a downpour! oh, yes, he was married. we had an affair for five years. then he got tired of it, of course. i was terribly in love, and he was the first. i remember it all like one long torment. long periods of agony, and brief moments when... your teaching me how to smoke reminded me. he smoked constantly. in hindsight it all seems so dreary. a real dime store novel. in some strange way it was never quite real. i don't know how to explain it. at least, i was never quite real to him. but my pain was real, that's for sure. but that was somehow all a part of it in some nasty way, as if that's how it was supposed to be. even the things we said to each other. lots of people have told me i'm a good listener. isn't that funny? no one's ever bothered to listen to me. like you're doing now. you're really listening. i think you're the first person who's ever listened to me. it can't be at all interesting. you could be reading a good book instead. how i'm going on! i hope i'm not irritating you. it feels so good to talk. it feels nice and warm. i've never felt like this in all my life. i've always wanted a sister. i have loads of brothers... seven. strange, eh? then i came along. i remember being surrounded by boys all my life. but i like boys. but i'm sure you know that, with all your experience as an actress. i like karl-henrik so much, but you really only love once. i'm faithful to him. opportunities come up in this line of work, i can tell you. karl-henrik and i rented a cottage by the sea once. it was june, and we were all alone. one day, when karl-henrik had gone into town, i went to the beach on my own. it was a warm and lovely day. there was another girl there. she'd paddled over from another island because our beach was sunnier and more secluded. we lay there sunbathing beside one another, completely naked, dozing now and then, putting suntan lotion on. we had those cheap straw hats on, you know? i had a blue ribbon around mine. i lay there peeping out from under my hat at the landscape and the sea and the sun. it was kind of funny. suddenly i saw two figures leaping about on the rocks above us. they would hide and then peek out. ""there's a couple boys looking at us,"" i told the girl. her name was katarina. ""let them look,"" she said, and turned over on her back. it was a strange feeling. i wanted to jump up and put on my robe, but i just lay there on my stomach with my bottom in the air, not at all embarrassed, completely calm. katarina lay there next to me the whole time, with her breasts and thick thighs. she just lay there sort of giggling to herself. i noticed that the boys had come closer. they just stood there looking at us. i noticed they were terribly young. then one of them... the more daring of the two... came up and squatted down next to katarina. he pretended to be busy picking at his toes. i felt so strange. suddenly i heard katarina say, ""hey, why don't you come over here?"" she took him by the hand and helped him off with his jeans and shirt. then suddenly he was on top of her. she guided him in with her hands on his behind. the other boy just sat on the slope and watched. i heard katarina whisper in the boy's ear and laugh. his face was right next to mine. it was red and swollen. suddenly i turned over and said, ""aren't you coming over to me too?"" and katarina said, ""go to her now."" he pulled out of her and fell on top of me, completely hard. he grabbed my breast. it hurt so bad! i was ready somehow and came almost at once. can you believe it? i was about to say, ""careful you don't get me pregnant"" when he suddenly came. i felt it like never before in my life, the way he sprayed his seed into me. he gripped my shoulders and arched backward. i came over and over. katarina lay on her side and watched and held him from behind. after he came, she took him in her arms and used his hand to make herself come. when she came, she screamed like a banshee. then all three of us started laughing. we called to the other boy, who was sitting on the slope. his name was peter. he came down, looking all confused and shivering despite the sunshine. katarina unbuttoned his pants and started to play with him. and when he came, she took him in her mouth. he bent down and kissed her back. she turned around, took his head in both hands, and gave him her breast. the other boy got so excited that he and i started all over again. it was just as good as before. then we went for a swim and parted ways. when i got home, karl-henrik was already back from town. we ate dinner and drank some red wine he'd brought. then we had sex. it's never been as good, before or since. can you understand that? i ended up pregnant, of course. karl-henrik, who's studying medicine, took me to a good friend of his, who performed an abortion. we were both relieved. we didn't want children. not then, anyway. it doesn't make any sense. nothing fits together. and the guilty conscience you feel over little things. you understand? and what about all the things you'd decided to do? don't you have to do them anymore? is it possible to be one and the same person at the very same time... i mean, two people? god, i'm being silly! anyway, there's no reason to start blubbering. i'll get a handkerchief. it's almost morning... and it's still raining. i've been talking nonstop while you've just listened. how boring for you. what could possibly interest you about my life? people should be like you. you know what i thought after i saw a film of yours one night? when i got home and looked in the mirror, i thought, ""we look alike."" don't get me wrong. you're much more beautiful. but we're alike somehow. i think i could turn into you if i really tried. i mean inside. you could be me just like that... though your soul would be far too big. it would stick out everywhere! go to bed... or you'll fall asleep here at the table. i must go to bed now or i'll fall asleep at the table, and that would be rather uncomfortable. good night. elisabet... did you speak to me last night? were you in my room last night? shall i take your mail too? let me have a taste. see ya. ""dear friend, i could live like this forever. the silence, the seclusion, reducing my needs, feeling my battered soul finally start to straighten itself out. alma pampers me in the most touching way. i think she's actually enjoying it here and that she's very fond of me, perhaps even a bit smitten in a charming, subconscious way. in any case, it's a lot of fun studying her. sometimes she cries over past sins... an orgy with a strange boy and a subsequent abortion. she complains that her notions about life fail to accord with her actions."" i see you're reading a play. that's a healthy sign. i'll tell the doctor. you think we should leave here soon? i'm starting to miss the city. aren't you? would you like to make me really happy? i know it's asking a lot, but i could use your help right now. nothing dangerous. but i do wish you'd talk to me. doesn't have to be anything special. we could talk about anything... what to have for dinner, whether the water's cold now after the storm, whether it's too cold to go swimming. just talk for a few minutes. one minute. you could read to me from your book. just say a few words. i have to try not to get angry. it's your business if you want to keep quiet. but i need you to talk to me now. can't you just say one word? i knew you'd refuse. you can't know how i feel. i always thought great artists felt this great compassion for other people... that they created out of great compassion and a need to help. that was silly of me. you've used me. for what, i don't know. now that you don't need me anymore, you toss me aside. yes, i hear perfectly well how phony that sounds! ""you've used me, and now you're tossing me aside."" but it's true... every word. and these glasses! you've hurt me badly. you've been laughing at me behind my back. i read the letter you wrote to the doctor. it wasn't sealed, and i read the whole thing. you got me to talk, to tell you things i've never told anyone. then you go and pass it on. great study material, eh? you're not... you're going to talk now! if you have something to say, by god... no, don't! scared there for a minute, weren't you? for a second you were genuinely scared, weren't you? a genuine fear of death, huh? ""alma's gone crazy,"" you thought. just what kind of person are you anyway? or maybe you just thought, ""i'll remember that face, that tone of voice, that expression."" i'll give you something you won't forget! you're laughing, are you? things aren't that simple for me. or so funny either. but you always have your laugh. does it have to be like this? is it really so important not to lie, to tell the truth, to speak in a genuine tone of voice? can a person really live without babbling away, without lying and making up excuses and evading things? isn't it better to just let yourself be silly and sloppy and dishonest? maybe a person gets better by just letting herself be who she is. no, you don't understand. you don't understand what i'm saying. there's no reaching someone like you. the doctor said you're mentally healthy, but i wonder if your madness isn't the worst kind. you act healthy, and the worst thing is, everyone believes you. except me, because i know how rotten you are. god, what am i doing? elisabet, forgive me. i'm behaving like an idiot. i don't know what got into me. i'm here to help you. it was that awful letter. i was so disappointed. you asked me to talk about myself. it felt so good. you seemed so kind and understanding. i'd had a lot to drink, and it felt so good to talk about it all. and i suppose i was flattered that a great actress like you would bother to listen. i even thought it would be nice if what i said were of some use to you. but that's awful, isn't it? sheer exhibitionism. elisabet, i want you to forgive me. i like you so much. you mean so much to me. i've learned so much from you. let's not part as enemies. you won't forgive me because you're too proud! you won't stoop to my level because you don't have to! i won't... ...we don't speak... ...don't listen... ...can't understand... ...what means... ...to persuade... to listen... when you sleep, your face goes slack... and your mouth is swollen and ugly. there's a nasty wrinkle on your forehead. you smell of sleep and tears... and i can see the pulse in your neck. there's a scar there that you cover with makeup. he's calling again. i'll find out what he wants from us... far away out here in our solitude. sorry if i frightened you. i'm not elisabet. i'm not here to make demands. i didn't mean to disturb you. you think i don't understand? the doctor explained everything. but the hardest part is explaining to your little boy. i do the best i can. there's something deeper down, hard to get a grip on. you love someone... or rather, you say you do. it's something tangible... at least, as far as words can be. mr. vogler, i'm not your wife. and you're loved as well. you build a community. it gives you security. you see a possible way of enduring, don't you? how can i say everything i've thought without getting lost... without boring you? i love you as much as ever. no, don't worry, my love. we have each other. we have faith in each other. we know each other's thoughts. we love each other. that's true, isn't it? - yes. and it's the effort that counts, not what we achieve, right? to see each other as children, tormented, helpless, lonely children. tell our little boy mommy will be back soon, that mommy's been ill, but she longs for her little boy. remember to buy a toy for him. a present from mommy. don't forget. i feel such great tenderness for you. it's almost unbearable. i don't know what to do with my tenderness. i thrive on your tenderness. elisabet, is it good for you with me? is it good for you? you're a wonderful lover. you know that. darling! give me a sedative. toss me aside. i can't go on! my darling... leave me alone! this is shameful, all of it! leave me alone! i'm cold and rotten and indifferent. it's all just a sham and lies! what have you got there? what are you hiding under your hand? let me see. it's the picture of your little boy, the one you tore up. we have to talk about this. tell me now, elisabet. then i will. it happened at a party one night, didn't it? it was late, and the party was quite rowdy. toward morning someone in the group said to you... ""elisabet, you have practically everything as a woman and as an artist, but you lack motherliness."" you laughed, thinking it was ridiculous, but later you found yourself thinking about what he'd said. you grew more and more worried... so you let your husband get you pregnant. you wanted to be a mother. when you knew it was definite, you became afraid... afraid of responsibility, of being tied down, of leaving the theater behind, afraid of pain, afraid of dying, afraid of your body that was swelling up. but you played the part the whole time, the part of the young, happy, expectant mother. everyone said, ""isn't she beautiful now? she's never been so beautiful."" meanwhile you tried several times to abort. but you failed. when you realized it was inevitable, you began to hate the baby and hoped it would be stillborn. you hoped the baby would be dead. you wanted a dead baby. it was a long and difficult delivery. you were in agony for days. the baby was finally delivered with forceps. you looked with disgust at your squealing child and whispered, ""can't you just die? can't you die?"" but he survived. the boy cried day and night... and you hated him. you were afraid. you had a guilty conscience. in the end, some relatives and a nanny took care of the boy, and you could leave your sickbed and return to the theater. but the suffering wasn't over. the boy was seized by a vast, unfathomable love for his mother. you resist. you resist desperately, because you feel you can't return that love. you try and try... but your encounters with him are cruel and awkward. you can't do it. you're cold and indifferent. and he looks at you. he loves you, and he's so soft, and you want to hit him for not leaving you alone. you find him repulsive, with his thick lips and ugly body and his moist, pleading eyes. you find him repulsive, and you're afraid. what have you got there? what are you hiding under your hand? let me see. it's the picture of your little boy, the one you tore up. we have to talk about this. tell me now, elisabet. then i will. it happened at a party one night, didn't it? it was late, and the party was quite rowdy. toward morning someone in the group said to you...

Bergman,Scenes from a Marriage,"- this room will be ideal for pictures. - sit here on the sofa. everybody look at the camera. nice, isn't it? let's see some happy faces. innocence and panic smile. you too, mom. watch the hair! that's the shot. - are we done? - i think so. the girls can go, at any rate. - good job, girls. - go have your sandwiches. good as gold. bye-bye. how about some shots of the husband and wife on the sofa? sure. move forward. don't slouch down. - i'll make myself look smaller. - make it a close-up. talk to each other. - marianne, turn your gaze a bit. - look as if you're fond of each other. now smile at each other. hold it. that's great. i got my shot, thank you. take a few portraits too. well, let's get cracking. i generally use a standard opener to put people at ease. - i'm not particularly nervous. - all the better. so, how would you describe yourselves in a few words? - that's tricky. - is it? - i might give the wrong impression. - you think so? it sounds cocky if i say i'm bright, youthful, successful and sexy. my mind has a global scope, i'm educated, and a i'm a great mixer. what else? i'm a good friend, even to those less fortunate than myself. i'm sporty, and i'm a good father and a good son. i don't have any debts, and i pay my taxes. i respect our government, no matter what. i love our royal family. i don't belong to the state church. is that good, or do you want more details? i'm a fantastic lover. isn't that right, marianne? maybe we should skip that question. your turn, marianne. what can i say? i'm married to johan and we have two daughters. - i can't think of anything else. - sure you can. - i think johan is very nice. - how kind of you. - we've been married for ten years. - yes, i just renewed the contract. i lack johan's boundless self-assurance, but in all honesty, i'm happy i lead the life i do. it's a good life, if you know what i mean. what else should i say? this is difficult. - she has a great figure. - i'm trying to take this seriously. - i have two girls, karin and eva. - you said that already. let's move on to the particulars. how old are you? - i'm 42, but it doesn't show. - i'm 35. we come from ridiculously bourgeois backgrounds. johan's father is a physician. my mother is very much the mother. my father is a lawyer. it was decided early on that i would become one too. i'm the youngest of seven children. my mother ran a large household. - nowadays she takes things easier. - oh, really? oddly enough, we enjoy the company of our parents. we see each other often, and we rarely clash. maybe we should talk about your professions. i'm an associate professor at the psychotechnology institute. my field is family law. i belong to a large law firm and deal mostly with divorce. the interesting thing about my job is... don't move! hold that pose. take a picture and get that look. good. great. - oh, that makes me feel... - you'll get used to it. how did you meet? i'll leave that to johan. now, that's an interesting tale. it wasn't love at first sight. both of us socialized quite a lot, and we often ran into each other. for many years we were heavily involved in political causes and belonged to a drama group at school. we weren't particularly interested in each other. i guess marianne thought i was conceited. at the time, johan was in a highly publicized romance with a pop singer. it gave him a certain image, and he was cocky. at 19, marianne was married to a boy whose only virtue was a rich father. he was very kind, and i was crazy about him. i also got pregnant. - but how did you... - get together? basically, it was marianne's idea. my baby died soon after it was born, and my husband and i split up. johan's singer had given him his walking papers. both of us were shaken, so i suggested we start seeing each other. we weren't in love, but both of us were unhappy. we realized that we got along famously, and our grades improved. so we decided to live together. we expected our mothers to be shocked, but they weren't. they became fast friends. we were accepted as a couple and got married six months later. - by that time we were in love. - madly in love. - people saw us as the perfect couple. - and it's been that way ever since. without any hitches? our material needs are met. we get on well with all our friends and relations. we have good jobs that we enjoy. we're in good health. and so on and so forth, to an almost embarrassing degree. security, order, contentment, loyalty. we're indecently fortunate. we do have our disagreements, but basically we get along well. - don't you ever quarrel? - marianne quarrels. johan is so slow to anger that it takes the wind out of my sails. that all sounds fabulous. i heard someone say just last night that the very lack of problems could cause strife. we're well aware of the hazards of a life like ours. hazards? how do you mean? the world is going to the dogs, and i prefer to live and let live. i'm entitled to simply look out for number one. it makes me sick to hear about the latest panacea. - i don't feel the same way as johan. - how do you feel? i believe... in compassion. could you please expand on that? if we all learned to care about our fellow man from childhood, the world would be different. hold that pose. look into the camera. listen to this: ""marianne's eyes are as blue as a folk song and are lit up from within. when i ask her how she copes with it all, she smiles in shy delight and replies that she and johan both pitch in."" which happens to be true. ""'we understand each other, ' she replies, brightening as johan sits down next to her on the heirloom sofa. protectively, he puts his arm around her, eliciting a smile."" - hey! - here comes the best bit. ""as i take my leave, i notice how they secretly appreciate that fact so they can bask in each other's presence once more. two souls who have matured together sharing a positive outlook, yet never forgetting to put love in the forefront."" we were mortified when we read it. i considered taking action, but our mothers adored the piece. one thing gets me: my eyes didn't get a mention. don't they shine with a secret light? they're more like dark pools. the effect is quite sexy. katarina has a crush on you. - how about running off with me? - a change would do johan good. he's lived a married life for ten years, and he's never strayed. are you sure? certainly. from the get-go i decided to believe everything johan tells me. did you hear that, katarina? well, i bet johan is a better liar than you, my silly little darling. i'm afraid i have a limited imagination. that's just it. less imagination makes for better liars. peter embroiders his tales too much. it's almost touching. i read your piece in technical times. even i could understand it. - actually, katarina wrote it. - are you really that clever? i was in germany, and they wanted an article on the spot. so katarina whipped one up and read it to me over the phone. why does it have your byline? it's not discrimination or anything. we generally collaborate. that's admirable. not if you consider how badly we get along. frankly, things are hell. cheers, honey! cheers. but surely i can tell johan and marianne how things are? - what's wrong, katarina? - nothing. peter can be such a clod. that's all. i'm a clod, all right. i'm proud to be a clod and to have an imagination. the odd thing is that katarina thinks i'm a spineless jellyfish. oh, my! let's try to have a pleasant time and not get into life's injustices. that's why we shouldn't forget... it's time for a little speech, with reference to that blessed article on the two of you. let's not forget that we are in the presence of a happy home that shouldn't be soiled with our emotional crap. cheers, marianne. the meal was lovely. i may not envy your domestic bliss, but i do admire your culinary talents. i mean it. i really wish katarina could pick up a few pointers. katarina's a much better cook. peter thinks i poison his food. it's a running joke at our house. it was clear it was a joke, right? one that's hard to digest. let's have some coffee in the living room. what should i do now? i seem to have put my foot in my mouth again. the girls will clear the table. it's pretty damn touching. what is? your marriage. johan and marianne. it's so touching, it brings tears to your eyes. it makes one itch to puncture that beautiful balloon of yours. you would do that? cheers. you've been married for ten years. we just celebrated our tenth anniversary. - no skeletons in the closet? - you never know. no, you never know. both johan and i enjoy cleaning up. well, what do you know! that's where we've been remiss: the cleaning. but that's going to change. next week i'll call marianne and have her arrange for our divorce. unfortunately, peter will back down again before he sobers up. the adding machine will start running, you see. it will say, ""i'll go through with a divorce if katarina relinquishes any claim on our swiss assets."" to which i counter, ""it's my money. i earned it."" then peter will say, ""i made it grow. you can have the factory."" and i say, ""great. a factory in italy with steadily rising labor costs."" katarina, please... ""take everything in sweden. the apartment, the summer cottage, the boat, the stocks and bonds."" and then i say, ""damned nice of you to leave me with the taxable assets."" excuse me for putting a damper on the evening with such trivial matters. but when peter talks about splitting up, then i know how drunk he is... and that insults are soon to follow. it's like i always say: katarina is a businessman. with equal emphasis on both parts of the word. business... man. she's also a brilliant artist. and she has an iq of i don't know what. and she's attractive too. a real gem in a stunning package. how such a paragon could ever spread her legs for me is a mystery. i think it's time to call a cab and go home. it can't be pleasant for johan and marianne to witness a scene like this. johan and marianne! they're candy figurines wrapped in red ribbons, like the gift-wrapped marzipan pigs of our childhood. it'll do their souls good to catch a glimpse of the depths of hell. august strindberg once said, ""could there be anything more terrifying than a husband and wife who hate each other?"" what do you say? child abuse could possibly be worse. but then again, katarina and i are children. deep down, katarina is a little girl who cries because no one comforts her when she falls. and in the opposite corner, i'm a little boy who cries because katarina can't love me. even though i'm bad and mean to her. well, on the bright side, there can't possibly be anything worse than this. that's why i think we're ready for a divorce. only if you're sensible. only if the two of us simultaneously, and in the presence of witnesses, sign all the papers. so neither of us can cheat the other. we'll call you sometime this week. we have a fine business lawyer. mr. borglund can help you with the business end. what do you say, katarina? even if our finances are resolved, you'll never let me go. i know that. so you think you're so bloody irreplaceable, my dear katarina? just when did this occur to you? that would be interesting to know. couldn't you tell me? tell us? you force me to have sex with you, since you can't get it up with anyone else. you have an insatiable need for guilt. now that it's over between you and jan, you feel desperate. now peter's the only one who cares and has the proper patience. so you think you're the only one? isn't that touching? you think i don't have anyone else. let me tell you something, peter. forgive me for being so frank, but peter's challenging the truth, and he needs to be enlightened. i want you to know this: i find you utterly repulsive. in a physical sense, i mean. i could buy a lay from anyone just to wash you out of my genitals. ""abide with me! fast falls the eventide; the darkness deepens; lord, with me abide."" you son of a bitch! ""when other helpers fail and comforts flee, help of the helpless, oh, abide with me."" whatever that's supposed to mean. i hope that won't stain the carpet. i'm not sure about liqueurs. - send me the bill. - no. do it! could you please pour me a cup of coffee? i'm... i'm pretty drunk. please forgive us. we don't usually behave like this. but you're our best friends. our only friends. forgive me. forgive us. call me a cab. i'll take my bacchante home, and we'll finish our little scene. the finale is generally inappropriate for an audience. - what time is it? - ten past 12:00. - i'm glad we got rid of them. - yes, things got a bit too festive. do you believe two people can spend a lifetime together? it's a ridiculous convention passed down from god knows where. a five-year contract would be ideal. or an agreement subject to renewal. - would that apply to us too? - no. - why not? - we're the exception that proves the rule. so you think we'll stay together? now, that's a strange question. doesn't it bother you to never get to sleep with anyone else? - no. does it bother you? - sometimes. i'll be damned. on a purely theoretical plane. i wonder if something's wrong with me. i don't have fantasies like that. i'm content. well, so am i. oh, now i get it. i know why katarina and peter go through hell. they don't speak the same language. they have to translate everything into a common language. i think it's simpler than that. you and i understand each other. we speak the same language. that's what makes us click. i think it's the money. if you speak the same language and trust each other, money is not a problem. you and your languages. i see it at work all the time. sometimes it's like husband and wife are talking on telephones that are out of order. sometimes it's like listening to pre-programmed tape recorders. sometimes all you get is the vast silence of outer space. i don't know which is worst. i have my doubts. what if we were factory workers and had to have the kids in day care? it doesn't matter. i don't agree. if you speak the same language, your environment isn't a factor. that's a romantic point of view. would a life like that affect us? are you serious? yes, i'm serious. we wouldn't get along as well? i really mean it. regardless of language. isn't there just as much potential for alienation and loneliness now? absolutely not. a dull, strenuous job would wear people down to a greater degree. you're dumber than i thought. - and you're the romantic, by the way. - we'll see. - and exactly what will we see? - i don't know. do you? - you're teasing me. - yes, i am. - aren't you hungry? - yes, i'm ravenous. how about a sandwich and a beer? sounds great. the art of sweeping things under the rug good morning. good morning. - did you sleep well? - like a log. how about you? fine. only i woke up at 5:00 and couldn't go back to sleep. why is that? i was irritated. should i feel guilty? for once you're innocent, my dear. the thought of sunday dinner with the folks had me steaming. we always have sunday dinner at your parents' place or mine. - and that's insane. - we do it to please them. well, i'm going to cancel. you're going to cancel? what will your mother say? she can say whatever she likes. i want to spend the day with you and the kids. well, if you can pull it off... i certainly can. the more i think about it, the madder i get. - is your period coming up? - why do you always say that? well, isn't it? all right, my period's due on monday, but that's not why i'm annoyed. what's bothering you? just think about it. every last second of our time is accounted for and booked solid. we have our vacations. don't you understand? our vacations are even more tightly scheduled. aren't you going to wake the girls? they're sleeping in today. karin has the day off, and eva has a sore throat. i want her to be well by sunday, to avoid all the snide remarks. weren't you going to cancel dinner? i want you to do it. i don't want to lock horns with your mother. well, aren't you going to call your mother? didn't we agree you would do it? no, honey. i'll hold your hand and provide moral support. all right, i'll do it. my heart is racing. the first baby steps in the great revolt. aren't they in? what a relief. miss alm, is my mother in? may i speak to her? how is your knee, miss alm? oh, it isn't any better, then? it's worse? now, that's too bad. what does the doctor say? he's not very understanding. i see. hello, mother. how are you? good. dad's already gone? that's right. he was going out to the country. you let him go off on his own like that? oh, erik went with him. that's nice. listen, i have something to tell you. that's right. how did you guess? why? i'd like to spend sunday with johan and the girls. no, we're not going anywhere. we just don't feel like coming over for dinner, that's all. i don't believe for one second that dad's been looking forward to it. really, mother, it should be a pleasure and not a duty. i see. i see. you hadn't told me that. to be honest, not entirely thrilled. no, forget it, mother. we'll show up, like we said we would. that'll be just fine. excellent. yes, we're looking forward to it. bye-bye, mother dear. bye. the revolution was smothered at birth. aunt elsa is coming to town. she hasn't visited in six months. she was looking forward to seeing us, and she has a gift for you. and mrs. danielsson was coming over to cook. and your dad was so looking forward to seeing us. i still think you were brave to try. we'll cancel another time. don't be upset. will you be home for dinner? i'll meet you at the theater at 7:20. don't you like coming home anymore? things are certainly complicated today, aren't they? i wish we could spend a whole week in bed just cuddling. and both of us could cry. that's not the life we chose to lead. i wish i could be certain our mothers didn't do the choosing. you suffer from a maternal persecution complex. is this the life you wanted? yes. what if we started cheating on each other? marianne, please. what would you do? kill you, of course. - sometimes i wish... - what? nothing. wait a second. i'll go with you. wouldn't it be better if you took your own car? no, this way we can drive home from the theater together. - what about the girls? - mrs. andersson is coming today. i'll call her from town and ask if she can cook something. she makes great pancakes. i'll go wake the girls. - i'm in a hurry. - it'll only take a minute. oh, by the way, please pay your parking tickets. there's a whole stack of them. yes, sir. see you at the theater. yes, it's me. oh, hi, mother. the line's so bad, i didn't recognize your voice. i'm fine, thank you. how are you? you're concerned? now, why is that? marianne's mother called... and she's concerned too? good grief. no, marianne and i are getting along fine. we're healthy, cheerful and insanely happy. nothing's wrong, i swear. don't worry. your intuition? well, it's led you astray. marianne and i are happy together. tell marianne's mother she should do something more constructive than gossip about worst-case scenarios. i'm pretty busy right now, mother. i'll see you soon. we'll stop by on friday, just like we promised. give my best to dad. damn. hi. am i disturbing you? please do. i just had to see what you're up to. there are so many rumors floating around. what are you doing? this does look mysterious. - shouldn't you be in lund? - yes. but the students are demonstrating for some deserving cause or another, and the lectures were canceled. lucky you. - what's this going to be? - take a look. - what am i supposed to do? - hold this pen. when i turn off the lights, you'll see a bright dot on the wall. try to touch it with the tip of the pen. if you miss, draw a line to it. we'll get it all on camera. - but it's dark. - we're using infrared lighting. i'll watch you on the monitor. lights out. be my guest. go ahead. are you pulling my leg? not at all. go on. could you... it keeps moving. it's not a trick. actually, the dot is stationary. i've had enough of this! turn the lights back on. my, you're upset. that was unpleasant. yes, it makes you nervous. funny, isn't it? look how you drifted, getting more and more irritated by the minute. so what does it prove? that remains to be seen. this is only the beginning. - i'd like a cigarette. - go ahead. have a seat. no! i gave up smoking six days ago, and it's a pain! having withdrawal symptoms? stefan's away and my friends are avoiding me. i'll go back to it, but i'll try to stick to my guns a while. go on, take a cigarette. bromeus left a pack behind when he spied on me yesterday. oh, that's heaven. what a relief. well? right. i spent the entire afternoon yesterday reading your poems. very carefully, from start to finish. twice. - they baffled me. - were they so very strange? that's not it. they weren't strange? well, i might be wrong. has marianne read them? no, you're the only one i've shown them to. marianne's not interested in poetry. - she ought to be interested in you. - she is, but not in that respect. she's not? - really? - what's so odd about that? you and i have been friends since we were students. we've never been sexually involved. you can provide an objective opinion before i try the publishers. i wouldn't bother. are they that bad? no, it's not that they're bad. if only that were the case. they're mediocre, is that it? they're insipid, proper and puerile? they're too personal, like indulging in spiritual masturbation? in our old crowd, many believed you were destined for greatness. we admired you. you were way ahead of us. we admired and even envied you. what's that got to do with my poetry? nothing. it was just a thought. i guess the withdrawal symptoms colored your view. you appear stressed. that's possible. i'm going to show them to others before i scrap them. of course you should. the publishing houses will have to tell me how bad they are. i've offended you. you sure did. i'm sorry. at least there's one person who appreciates them. - who would that be? - are you curious? my dear little johan. pay no attention to me. - it was just my craving talking. - right. well, i've got to go. i'll leave your poems at the door. give my love to marianne. you know i'll always be there for you. that's nice of you. bye. i'll see you around 12:30 then. bye. i'm sorry to have kept you waiting. in this first meeting we usually establish the issues and look at how to solve them. i want a divorce. - how long have you been married? - over 20 years. do you have a profession? no, i'm a housewife. why do you want a divorce? there's no love in our marriage. is that the reason? yes. you've been married for a long time. was this always the case? yes, always. and now that your children have left the nest, you want to leave as well. my husband is a responsible man. he's kind and conscientious. i have nothing to complain about. he's been an excellent father. we've never quarreled. we have a nice apartment and a lovely summer cottage we inherited from my mother-in-law. we're both fond of music. we belong to a chamber music society and play together. it all sounds ideal. yes, it does. but there is no love between us. there never has been any. forgive me for asking, but have you met someone? no, i haven't. what about your husband? as far as i know, he's never been unfaithful. won't you be lonely? i guess. but it's even lonelier living in a loveless marriage. have you told your husband you want a divorce? of course. fifteen years ago i told him i didn't want to live with him anymore, since there was no love in our marriage. he was very understanding. he merely asked me to wait until the children had grown up. now all three have grown up and left home. now i can have my divorce. so what does he say? he keeps asking me what's wrong with our marriage. and i tell him i can't go on with a relationship that lacks love. then he asks me what love is supposed to involve. but i tell him i don't know. how can i describe something that's not there? have you been on good terms with your children? emotionally. i've never loved my children. i know that now. i used to think i did. you always do. but i know now that i never loved them. still, i've been a good mother. i've done all i could, even though i never felt anything for them. i know just what you're thinking. really? ""a spoiled woman with no sense of humor. she has everything she could possibly want, but still she goes on about love. what about friendship, loyalty, security?"" something like that, yes. let me tell you something. i have a mental picture of myself that doesn't correspond to reality. pardon me... if i ask you a personal question. isn't it true that love... what were you going to ask? i'm not sure. forgive me. i tell myself i have the capacity to love. but it's been... bottled up. the life i've led has stifled my potential. the time has come to change all that. the first step is divorce. my husband and i... cancel each other out. that sounds frightening. it is frightening. something peculiar is happening. my senses... sight, hearing, touch... are starting to fail me. this table, for instance. i can see it and touch it. but the sensation is deadened and dry. do you understand? i think i do. it's the same with everything... music, scents, faces, voices. everything seems puny, gray, and undignified. now for some food and drink. and to get out of these clothes. getting through ibsen on nothing but a hot dog was an ordeal. remember when our parents almost threw us out because we joined the may day parade? you were more zealous about politics. and you accused me of neglecting our home. that was the year we came down with the asian flu. we thought the future was bright. it's nice to have faith in things. and we had the pleasure of annoying our parents at the same time. you were such a hothead back then. not as bad as your dad. no, you were worse. pretty and hotheaded. you were awfully attractive as a socialist. - aren't i now? - what? - awfully attractive? - of course. but married couples aren't as hot for each other after a while. that's not true in our case though. we're just too busy. when evening rolls around, we're exhausted. that wasn't meant as a reproach. i swear. we like each other in every way. not in that way. not very much, anyway. oh, yes, we do. our life is full of little evasions and restrictions. i can't help the fact i don't enjoy it as much as i used to. there's a perfectly natural explanation. don't lay this guilt on me. don't get so upset. i think we have it nice. things are not as passionate as they once were, but we could be worse off. without a doubt. sex isn't everything, after all. if you're not satisfied, go find yourself a mistress who's more imaginative and exciting. i do my best, i assure you. there we have it. - you've got that look again. - i haven't got any look. that look and that tone of voice. instead of brooding, just spit it out. you'll just lose your temper. no, i'm listening... with an open mind. sometimes i wonder why we complicate this problem so awfully. making love is pretty basic. it shouldn't be a huge, overshadowing issue. it's your mother's fault, if you ask me, though you don't like my saying so. - what a superficial analysis. - don't be a sourpuss. i'm being nice. you think it's my fault we don't enjoy it anymore. - you just said you do your best. - i really do. can't you hear how preposterous that sounds? are you calling me a liar? no, for christ's sake. then i don't understand. let's drop this and go to bed. it's late. it's just like you to start a discussion to get me all riled up, only to yawn and say it's bedtime. you suffer from devastatingly high standards. we've often joked and argued about it. but can't our poor sex life be spared your ambitions? why won't you cut me some slack? first you attack me for not trying and then for making the effort. what a mess i've made. yes, you sure have. it would be more helpful if you were kind. there, there, sweetheart. i shouldn't have brought it up. it's possible to talk too much about these things, you know. yes, it is. i know you should discuss everything and not keep secrets. but in this case i think it's wrong. i think you're right. some matters should be protected from prying eyes. you think so? i'm sure of it. we hurt each other for no reason, and the barbs are still there when we go to bed. it's like lying on a bed of nails. - what are you laughing at? - the bed of nails bit. - go on and laugh then. - let's go to bed. only if you admit that you've been tactless. i apologize. don't i give you enough affection? affection takes time. then you don't get enough. we don't get enough. or give enough. that's why i wanted us to go away this summer. affection shouldn't be kept just for vacations. you're nice... for a moron. it's lucky i'm married to you then. you have moments of greatness, interspersed with sheer mediocrity. i'm sure that's true. at our age, tens of thousands of brain cells burn out every day, and they're never replaced. well, a fool like you must lose a million a day. you're adorable, even though you do scold and fuss. right. i'm nearly asleep anyway. i'll just go check on the children. don't worry. i'm practically asleep. - aren't you going to set the alarm? - i've got it in my hand. if you like, you can make love to me. thanks for the offer, but i'm too tired. it can't be! you're here already? i wasn't expecting you until tomorrow. what a lovely surprise! are you hungry? how sweet of you to get here sooner. the girls are asleep. we all went to bed early. there was nothing on tv, so we turned in early. the girls and i have been dieting today. would you like a sandwich? that sounds nice. or should i fry some ham and eggs? or heat up some soup? sandwiches and beer will be just fine. by the way, peter and katarina are going to call you on monday. it's quite an ordeal they're going through. are they getting divorced? they don't seem to know what they want. is that so strange? i advised them to get separate lawyers, but they refused. listen, change into your pajamas and i'll bring a tray up to the bedroom. sounds good. and here i was worried you might be angry with me. - why should i be angry? - i was nasty on the phone last night. oh, that. that was nothing. i called back, but you must have unplugged the phone. i was pretty tired. i'd spent the day with that zombie from the ministry. it makes you wonder about the idiots in charge of our well-being. i still think i behaved badly. let's drop it. you never want to finish discussions, do you? but this won't take long, dear. all i wanted to say was that you were right, but so was i. if you don't want to wear a tuxedo, that's your business. i agree. but if i think you should get a new tux, then i have a right to say so. i don't like tuxedos. i hate wearing a tuxedo. it's a ridiculous getup. i feel like a dressed-up chimpanzee. yes, you told me that. let's not quarrel. i love you, even if you won't wear a tux. it's hardly essential to our marriage. - it sure seemed that way last night. - i told you i was wrong. i'm getting hungry just watching you eat. i can't help it. i've got to have a sandwich. i'm so hungry, i'm dizzy. i've lost almost five pounds this week. - does it show? - no. i can feel a difference, though. but it seems so pointless at times. i mean, why should we deny ourselves the good things in life? why can't we be fat and cheerful? remember aunt miriam and uncle david? they were big, fat and cheerful. they slept in that creaky double bed of theirs, holding hands, content with each other, fat and happy. why can't we be like them? brimming with contentment? what's the matter? are you upset? has something happened? what's wrong? tell me. i came here to tell you something. i've gone and fallen in love. it's absurd, and probably a big mistake. most probably a big mistake. i met her at that convention in june. she was the interpreter and secretary. actually, she's studying for her degree. she's going to teach slavic languages. she's nothing much to look at. you would probably think she's ugly. i have no idea what this will lead to. i have no idea about anything. i'm utterly bewildered. of course, i'm happy in one way. but i do feel damn guilty about you and the children. we've always gotten along so well. things have been no better and no worse than for the average family. say something, for christ's sake. i don't know what to say. you probably think it was wrong of me not to tell you sooner. i didn't know how it would turn out. i figured i'd get over it. i didn't want to worry you. it's funny. what's funny? that i didn't notice anything. i didn't suspect a thing. everything's been just like usual. better, in fact. you've been so sweet. i've been a silly, blind fool. i didn't even notice. christ. no, you never noticed. but you've never been particularly observant. where do we go from here? i don't know. do you want a divorce? are you going to marry her? why tell me tonight of all times? what's the rush all of a sudden? we're leaving for paris tomorrow. i want to get away. at least for a while. i was going this fall anyway, to see grandin and his assistant. paula has this study grant and wants to use it this fall. i want to be with her. i can't make it without her. so we're leaving tomorrow. now that i'm here, talking to you, i feel like scrapping the whole thing. i just feel frightened and tired. nothing could be more absurd or clichg(c)d. i know just what you're thinking. i have no excuse. how can you know what i'm thinking? i'm trying not to feel guilty. that would just be an act. this is how it is, and nothing can be done about it. let's go to bed. it's late. i guess you'll be leaving early tomorrow. i have an appointment at 9:00. then i suggest we go to bed. aren't you going to change? - you have marks on your chest. - i know. how tactless of you both. do you know if my gray suit is here or in town? - it's at the dry cleaners. - what a nuisance. - did you want to take it with you? - of course. i have the receipt, if you'd like to pick it up. i won't have time. i'll be busy until 3:00. and then we leave. if you like, i could pick it up. i'll do your packing too. you're not very good at it. no, thank you. now you're being silly. i'm quite conventional. besides the suit, i think you have everything you'll need. there are clean shirts and underwear, so you can take those with you. why don't you travel in your jacket and flannels? - they make you look youthful. - whatever you say. how long will you be gone? - it all depends. - what do you mean? i've been granted a leave of absence for six months, and i'm bringing a month's worth of work with me. so i guess i'll be away for at least seven or eight months. i want to make a clean break. - and if i'm not here when... - i don't give a damn. do you know how long i've had this in mind? not the affair with paula, but how long i've wanted to leave? don't say it. i've wanted to be rid of you for four years. - no more. - you're right. words don't mean much. what are you going to live on? i mean, during your leave of absence. you'll have to pay child support. don't worry. i'll manage. you must have assets i'm not aware of. indeed i do. how is that possible? shut up and listen! even though it's none of your damn business. i've sold the boat and taken out a loan. the bank will pay you and the girls 1,600 kronor a month. we'll make other arrangements when i get back. i suggest you ask one of your lawyer colleagues for advice. i don't give a damn. you can name your price. i'm not taking a thing, apart from my books, if that's all right with you. i'll vanish. i'll dematerialize. i'll pay all i can to support you and the children. my needs are minimal. all that interests me is to end this. guess what i'm fed up with most of all. all this harping about what we're expected to do and what we must take into consideration. ""what will your mother think?"" ""what will the children say?"" ""how shall we arrange the dinner party, and shouldn't we invite my father?"" ""we must go to the coast, to the mountains, to st. moritz."" ""we must celebrate christmas, easter, birthdays, name days..."" every single goddamn occasion! - my poor darling... - i don't want your sympathy! all these words i'm spouting are just empty talk. i don't imagine for one minute that i've touched on the truth about us. i don't think there is such a thing as the truth. no matter what we say or do, it will hurt. don't go. that's impossible. - what if i beg? - it's no use, and it's embarrassing. couldn't you postpone your trip for a month or two? i believe we can save our marriage. we could make a fresh start. allow me that much. maybe paula would understand me. maybe i should meet her and talk to her. let's face this together. you're presenting me with a fait accompli. you're putting me in a ridiculous and intolerable situation. i know exactly what you mean. what will our parents say? what will your sister think? what will our friends think? lord, think of all the gossip! how will it affect the girls, and their friends' mothers? what about the dinner parties we're already scheduled to attend? and what will you tell peter and katarina? to hell with all that! it feels good to act like a cad. - that wasn't what i meant. - then what did you mean? nothing. i forgot to set the alarm. when do you need to leave? please set it for 5:30. i need to pack, and i have to be at work by 9:00. i've been meaning to get a new alarm clock. this one is so noisy. and it's not very reliable either. there. it's set for 5:30. i'll wake up on my own anyway, so you don't have to worry. - tell me about paula. - for the love of... - what's the point? - i want you to. why torment yourself? it's not self-torment. i want to know what she's like. it's much worse to try to picture someone you know nothing about. do you have a picture of her? could we not do this? please do it for me. you asked for it. now, where did i put my wallet? i guess it's in my coat pocket. here are two pictures of her. that one was taken two years ago, when she was on vacation. the passport picture was taken two weeks ago. it's a good likeness. she has a lovely figure. and lovely breasts. right? yes, she has lovely breasts. - does she dye her hair? - it's possible. what a nice smile. - how old is she? - twenty-three. she hasn't been very lucky in love. she's been engaged twice. in that respect, i think she's made a muddle of her life with all kinds of men. does that bother you? it sure does. her frankness can be quite unpleasant. i would prefer not to know anything, but she insists on giving me the details of her erotic past. which is trying, since i suffer from retrospective jealousy. she has no illusions. she says she has no great hopes for the two of us. she's convinced i'll go back to you, that she doesn't have a chance against you. sometimes it sounds like lines from some old hackneyed melodrama. are you good together in bed? yes, we are, actually. at first it was awful. i wasn't used to it. being with other women, i mean. i guess you and i have spoiled each other. you and i have taken refuge in a hermetically sealed existence. everything's been orderly, and it's all gone like clockwork. but the lack of oxygen has smothered us. and now your little paula will revive you? i don't possess much self-knowledge, and i know very little about reality, in spite of all the books i've read. but i believe that this catastrophe is the chance of a lifetime. has paula filled your head with garbage like that? how nagyive can you get? this conversation can do without your taunts and sarcastic remarks. you're right. i'm sorry. i'm trying. i'm trying to be as honest as i can, and it's not exactly easy. we've never talked like this before. is it any wonder we're nagyive, insecure and childish? what else could we expect? you're in a tight spot. come and lie beside me. please. i want you to make love to me. please? for old times' sake. lie here in my arms. we'll fall asleep together. i don't think i can sleep. the best thing would be to pack my things and leave. lie down and close your eyes. you'll doze off. we need rest. tomorrow will be a tough day. i'm so goddamn ashamed of myself. we'll talk about that later. right now it's just you and me. we have a few hours left together. would you like to pack or have breakfast first? you decide. - tea or coffee? - tea, please. what about your mail? i'll send you my address. you can forward the important letters and pay the bills in the usual way. the plumber was supposed to repair the bathroom in town. have you called him, or should i do it? i figured it might have slipped your mind. should i take care of it so we get it done? the guy is never in when i call. i hadn't forgotten about it. what about your car? will you leave it in the garage? i've asked paula's sister to take care of it. no point letting it sit around, and she's just moved out of town. i understand. could you please cancel my dentist's appointment? what are we going to do about your father's birthday dinner? please call him and explain. would you, please? that's almost the worst part. maybe i could write him a letter? do whatever you like. just don't forget. dealing with our parents will be rough. - what should i tell the girls? - say whatever you like. that you fell in love with someone else and walked out on us? that about covers it. it also has the advantage of being true. i don't expect them to understand. i have to leave now to avoid traffic. - good-bye, marianne. take care. - good-bye. - i might be back in a week. - if only you were! we'd make a fresh start. we'd throw out our stale old routines. we'd talk about the past. figure out where we went wrong. you'd hear no accusations from me. johan... this all seems so unreal. i don't know what to do. you're shutting me out. any solution would be better than this. couldn't you promise to come back? that would tide me over. then you wouldn't be leaving me without hope. even if you have no intention of returning, you could say you do. i have to go now. fredrik? it's me, marianne. sorry to wake you. is birgit there? no, let her sleep. so, how are things? oh, so you like quiet mornings on your own. well, i won't keep you. it's cloudy here. how nice for you. fredrik, there's something i need to talk to you about. i really need to talk. you and birgit are our friends. i have to... it's all so unreal, fredrik. you see... i'm about to burst into tears, but crying only makes things worse. you see... johan has fallen in love with another woman. her name is paula, and they're leaving for paris today. couldn't you talk to him and ask him to wait a bit? tell him he shouldn't rush off like this. what? you have talked to him? i see. i see. so, the two of you have known all along. you knew, but you never told me? and you call yourselves friends? how could you be so goddamned disloyal to me? i don't care what you say! all those times we've gotten together, and neither of you said a word! damn you! what kind of friends are you anyway? to hell with your reasons! how many others already know? i'd really like to know that! lots of people. i see. that's good to know! the vale of tears please come in. you look nice. that's a pretty blouse. you think so? i bought it a few weeks ago, but i'm afraid it's too girlish for me. you look great. take your coat off. standing here in the hall makes me nervous. i feel nervous too. i haven't been able to get much done today. it's silly, but it's been more than six months since i've seen you. - how come you suddenly... - paula's in london for a week. - would you like a drink? - yes, please. i'd love a whiskey. straight. it settles the stomach. calms you down. - you like whiskey nowadays? - yes, imagine that. cheers. aunt berit's looking after the girls, to everyone's mutual delight. they're going to the theater, and then to the country tomorrow. that's convenient. i mean, it might have been awkward seeing the kids. - how are they doing? - don't ask just to be polite. but please don't forget their birthdays again. i bought them presents from you, but they weren't fooled. couldn't you take them out to dinner or to the movies? it's awful the way you never get in touch with them. - they hardly ever mention you anymore. - that's understandable. can't paula let you see us without starting a fight? if you're going to start with that, i'd better leave. you've said yourself that she's insanely jealous. what am i supposed to do? are you such a coward that you can't stand up to her? yes. i'm sorry. that's all right. i know you find the situation absurd, but scolding won't do any good. - would you like some more whiskey? - yes, please. how are things, johan? pretty much as usual. and you? i can't complain, i guess. could be worse. it was silly of me to suggest this. we can't seem to talk without hurting each other. i have an excellent suggestion: let's have dinner. we're probably both starving and that's why we're so touchy. that's an excellent suggestion. you look funny in that haircut... and you've put on some weight. you really turn me on. - what should we do about that? - we'll see after dinner. this wine is nice. it's nothing special. just an inexpensive claret, but it's good. i don't mind telling you things are going pretty well for me. i've been offered a chair at cleveland university for three years. really? it's a great opportunity. both financially and career-wise. that's where things are happening in my field. and i'll be glad to emigrate. there's nothing to keep me here. i'm fed up with this academic backwater. and i have no desire to go on being fleeced by the tax man. so i'll be leaving this spring, if all goes well. congratulations. here i am, going on about myself. but i'm in such a good mood. then perhaps we could discuss our divorce? if you're going abroad, we might as well get the ball rolling. - what do you think? - as you like. i'd like us to file for divorce. you never know. i might want to remarry. and things would be complicated if you're in the states. you have someone in mind? maybe i do. come on, tell me more. it'll keep me from rattling on. would you like some more? no, thanks. and stop being evasive. how are things? judging by your appearance and your attitude, they must be pretty good. i'm curious. do you have a lover? i'll get the coffee. you do want coffee, right? yes, please. sounds like you're disappointed. that's just your imagination. you should know i think about you all the time. wondering if you're all right, or if you're afraid or lonely. every day, several times a day, i wonder what i did to cause the breach between us. i know it's a childish way of thinking, but there you are. what did i do wrong? why not ask a psychiatrist? i see one several times a week. sometimes we meet in private. is he your lover? we did have sex a few times, but it was no good. so we stopped that and devoted ourselves to my soul instead. what have you learned? nothing. basically, i'm learning to talk. and i threw your things out of the study and moved mine in. it left me feeling guilty, but awfully bold. well, it led to something then. what an enormous yawn. sorry. it's the wine. and i haven't slept well. i've been so tense. if you'd like to go, feel free. don't make a big deal out of it. you can take a nap if you like. i'll wake you in an hour. so much fuss about a yawn. i don't want to sleep. i want to hear about your inner quest. that's much more interesting, i promise you. there's not much to tell. though something funny did strike me, but i haven't told my therapist yet. that sounds exciting. my therapist told me to jot down everything that pops into my head. no matter how irrelevant. thoughts, memories, dreams. i haven't written much so far. i'm not used to writing. it generally turns out stilted and kind of silly. why don't you read me what you wrote last night? i'd really like to hear it. would you really like to hear it? are you sure? i'll just go get my notebook. i wrote for hours on end, you know. i was up until 3:00, so i looked like the dickens this morning. it figures that would happen the night before i see you. you look so pretty. so terribly pretty, marianne. no compliments, please. take an interest in my soul instead. go sit down. go sit down. don't. no. please. let me read to you instead. one good thing needn't exclude the other. i've been thinking about this all this time. about having sex with you. i've been longing for you. but after you leave, i'd be left with my longing, and i don't want that. don't you realize i'm in love with you? sometimes i hate you for what you did to me. sometimes i don't think of you for hours, and it's heaven. i have everything i could want. i have my friends, even lovers. there's the kids and my job that i enjoy and am good at. yet i'm bound to you. i don't know why. maybe i'm a masochist, or the kind of woman who can only ever love one man. i don't know. it's so hard, johan. i don't want to live with anyone but you. other men bore me. i'm not trying to make you feel guilty... or blackmail you emotionally. i'm just telling you how i feel. that's why i can't bear you kissing me and making love to me. i can't explain it any other way. because you'll walk away, and i'll be left longing for you. i've sort of enjoyed having you at a distance. so let's keep our hands to ourselves. you'll just leave me devastated. i'm still in love with you. why say that when it isn't true? don't you think i've longed for you? i have. we were good together. we were friends. we had fun. if we feel like having sex, why shouldn't we? it only shows we still long for each other. why have all these reservations? why worry about tomorrow? no, johan. johan, i don't want to. i want you to stop it! i don't want to pine and weep and long for you. please understand. this is how it really is. it's no good. if you're going to persist, you might as well leave. i don't want to sleep with you. please try to understand. i'm trying to understand, but i can't. look, i'll just sit here. i'll sit here and you can read to me. then i'll go home and call paula and say i've been to the theater. may i have some more coffee? i feel terribly foolish. i just want to hide somewhere and cry. well... if you like, i could leave now. we could have dinner tomorrow. perhaps that would be better. no, stay after all. i'm busy tomorrow. - hi there. - hi. i really, really like you. and i'm acting like a child. everything's all right. the situation's under control. we've pulled through the crisis. i can barely read my own writing. the beginning isn't important. ""yesterday i was seized by a reckless gaiety. for the first time this year i felt a zest for life, eager to know what the day might bring."" and so on. right. here it is. ""suddenly i turned and looked at an old school picture from back when i was ten. i seemed to detect something that had eluded me up to then. to my surprise i must admit that i don't know who i am. i haven't the vaguest idea. i've always done as i was told. as far as i can remember i've been obedient, well-adjusted, almost meek. i did assert myself once or twice as a girl, but mother punished any lapses from convention with exemplary severity. my entire upbringing, and that of my sisters, was aimed at making us agreeable. i was ugly and awkward, a fact i was constantly reminded of. i later realized that if i kept my thoughts to myself, and was ingratiating and predictable, my behavior yielded rewards. the most momentous deception began at puberty. all my thoughts, feelings and actions revolved around sex. but this i never told my parents. or anyone at all, for that matter. being deceitful and secretive became second nature to me. my father wanted me to follow in his footsteps and become a lawyer. i dropped hints that i wanted to be an actress, or do something else in the world of theater. but they laughed at me. since then i go on pretending, faking my relationships with others, with men, always putting on an act in a desperate attempt to please. i've never considered what i want, but only, 'what does he want me to want?' it's not unselfishness, as i used to believe. it's sheer cowardice. even worse, it stems from my being ignorant of who i am. our mistake was that we never broke free from our families to create something worthwhile on our own terms."" oh, darn, i fell asleep. and your words were so interesting too. forgive me. could you go on? that is, if i haven't offended you. i think you should go home and get some sleep. i'm not offended. really. yeah, i guess i should go. please keep in touch, if only for the children's sake. of course. you're always welcome here. if only paula wasn't so jealous. but i guess she feels justified. it's hard on her too. when will you know about the us? in a month or so. let me know how it goes. i'll call or write. we need to decide about the divorce. - do you want to marry again? - i don't know. i'd rather wait. what do you think? i'm not sure what i think. you will stay tonight, won't you? yes, i'll stay. how do you feel? frightened. how about mustering up some courage? some courage? what is it? can't you sleep? not a chance. i feel miserable. i'd better go home. forgive me. - that's paula's handwriting. - she wrote to me. - what's she up to now? - she sent this before she left. you should read it. read it here. ""dear marianne, i suspect you're surprised to get a letter from me. i assure you there's no ulterior motive behind this letter. i took this job in london to get away for a week and thereby break a vicious cycle of jealousy and suspicion. i know johan will contact you the minute i've gone. i only have myself to blame, as i've kept him from seeing you and the children. if only it were possible to put things right."" isn't that typical of paula. she wants us to be friends. she can't stand this hostility. how touching... particularly the fact that you believe her. ""johan is the gentlest, kindest, most affectionate person i've ever met. he has no self-confidence at all, though he tries to put up a brave and cheerful front."" you can say anything about anyone. it always fits in some respect. the illiterates come on in. i'm glad we could meet here at your office. saves us some time. it's not exactly cozy. but it's fine for divorce matters. look at this. here's the agreement, word for word as we decided. - then i don't need to read it. - never sign what you haven't read. - don't look so grumpy. - i'm not grumpy. you're as grumpy as can be. here's a list of our common property and its distribution. it's just a list. it doesn't require a signature. you get granny's clock? that must be a mistake. your grandmother gave it to me. we've already discussed this. i don't recall discussing granny's clock. if you're so attached to it, keep it, but it happens to be mine. you're always right, aren't you? take the clock. i'm not going to squabble over trifles. make sure i haven't fleeced you out of anything else. your sarcasm is wasted on me. i have such a miserable cold. how about a glass of fine old brandy? sounds good. egerman gave me a bottle. some grateful parisian colleagues gave him a whole case. cheers. not bad, huh? i like it. i don't care for brandy as a rule, but this is very nice. i feel better already. - it's hard. - what's hard? - getting divorced. - it's just paperwork. i still think it's hard. we've been living apart for ages, we rarely see each other, we've both agreed to it, but i still feel guilty. it's strange. it's strange. so it is. on my way over, i was in a good mood. i was determined not to cry or be affected by it all. you said you felt guilty. let's go sit over on the couch instead. and put the lights out. the glare is ghastly. how can you work in such a bleak room? the couch isn't comfortable either. it's fine if you put your feet up. - more brandy? - yes, please. - comfy? - yes. is this building empty tonight? - there's a night watchman. - how nice. what's nice about it? i don't know. it's just nice, that's all. nothing's nice when you're sick. stop feeling sorry for yourself. it's not like it's terminal. this gets better and better. you really are in a good mood. yes, i am. to be honest, i'm in love. with that david person? - no, that's over. - really? don't worry about that. give me a kiss. i've got a cold. i never catch your germs. so give me a kiss. i want you to. was it what you expected? much better. now put your hand on my breast. - are you seducing me? - that's right. right here on the carpet, right now. doesn't that sound like fun? you look suspicious. afraid of the night watchman? after all, we're still married. come lie on top of me. people should make love on the floor more often. - lock the door. - no one will walk in on us. you never know. i'm kind of a prude. lock the door. - just in case the watchman comes. - right. hurry up. - he might be eavesdropping. - no, it's time for his rounds. is it wise to take your slacks off with a cold like that? - you can keep me warm. - so you don't freeze your thing off. poor baby, you're so miserable. kiss me. i enjoy being kissed by you. close your eyes or i'll feel self-conscious. now put your hands on my hips. good. that's nice. what if the watchman walked in now? he could join us. we're liberated. let's stay here all night... and just drink and make love. we'll file our divorce papers tomorrow. - a penny for your thoughts. - my thoughts? wouldn't you like to know. - are you hungry? - always. what about some steak tartare and beer? you shouldn't be taking me out. i'm in uppsala with my students. poor paula. in that case, i'd love to have dinner with you. where's the bathroom? down the hall and to the left. let's sign these papers and go out and celebrate. pay tribute to a long and happy marriage. i think i'll take them home and study them in peace and quiet. why the about-face now after all our talks? you told me yourself i should read them. then by all means, let's read through the whole thing. make sure i haven't cheated you. why are you so upset? i'm not. let's start reading. you look pissed off to me. i am, but i'll control myself. like i always do when subjected to your whims. let's get off this tedious subject. it's late, and tomorrow's a working day. - don't you want to have dinner? - no, thank you. i'm grateful for the favors already bestowed upon me. - talk about whims. - now look here, johan! it's pointless even trying to discuss this now. let's stuff these into an envelope. then you can take them home, and you and paula can pore over the wording to make sure i haven't screwed you over. - what's going on? - nothing. - we were good friends a minute ago. - right. by the way, don't forget eva's birthday. do i usually forget the children's birthdays? no, because i always remind you. could you pay for her trip to france? i can't afford it. - how much is it? - two thousand kronor. are you out of your mind? out of the question! ask your mother to foot the bill. i've borrowed too much from her as it is. well, i can't afford it. i just paid karin's orthodontist. - doesn't she have free dental care? - she refuses to go to that clinic. eva will have to cancel her trip. i don't have any money. it won't do her harm to learn she can't have everything. she's too goddamn spoiled. and she has no manners. last week she visited my mother and her behavior was appalling. your mother told you that? well, eva's at a difficult age. you'll have to discipline them. don't let the girls rule the roost. what kind of talk is that? they trust me. we talk about everything, and for that i'm grateful. i could care less about petty details like manners. tell her i can't afford the trip. tell her yourself. why? you have custody. all i do is fork out huge sums in child support, which i'm taxed on, leaving me high and dry. you and i were born with silver spoons in our mouths. we've squandered our resources, leaving us poor, bitter and angry. however trite, it's the truth. we're emotional illiterates. we've been taught about anatomy and farming methods in africa. we've learned mathematical formulas by heart. but we haven't been taught a thing about our souls. we're tremendously ignorant about what makes people tick. that signals the end of my lecture. i had nothing more to say anyway. how about some more brandy? then we can decide about dinner. i don't agree with you, but no matter. by the way, that job in the us went down the tubes. - not that it matters. - that's a shame. well, i was pretty disappointed. there was the usual wheeling and dealing. first things were postponed, then there was no money, and then they sent someone else. that's life. cheers! i'll be 45 this summer. i can expect to live another 30 years. viewed objectively, i'm dead weight. i'll spend the next 20 years being a damn nuisance. i'm an expensive, unproductive unit that ought to be eliminated. and i'm supposed to be in my prime, brimming with experience. but it's, ""throw the loser out. let him rot!"" i'm so goddamn tired. i hardly know who i am. someone spat on me and now i'm drowning in the spittle. am i boring you? - it's funny. - what's funny? i wanted to have sex with you today to see if i felt anything. all i felt was lukewarm affection. you know what? i think i'm breaking free at last. it's taken a long time and it's been very painful, but i'm free of you now to start living my own life, and that feels absolutely wonderful. allow me to congratulate you. i don't know why i told you. it's callous of me to say it when you're having such a rough time. but oddly enough, i don't care. i've taken your feelings into account far too often. being considerate killed our love. if i hadn't let myself get sidetracked by guilt, i'd have known everything we did was wrong. remember after karin was born? when sex became impossible? how we put the blame on my two pregnancies. we concocted so many reasons why making love gave us no pleasure. warning lights were flashing all around us, but we ignored them. these postmortems are so pointless. your idiotic sarcasm drives me crazy! what gives you the right to tell me what to think and feel? lord, how i hate you. i used to think that quite often. ""lord, how i hate her."" especially when we made love and i felt your indifference. and when i saw you naked at the bidet afterwards, washing out the nasty stuff i'd deposited inside you, i'd think, ""i hate her body, the way she moves."" i should have beaten you. i wanted to smash that hard white resistance that emanated from you. but we chatted away and talked about how well we got along. tell me, why do i enjoy sex now? i do everything he asks. just you wait. when you're married to him, everything will repeat itself. just you wait and see. your behavior's deeply rooted. then you'll look for a new lover to free you from your loathing. you're wrong. there is such a thing as simple affection. to say nothing of sensuousness. and physical desire. in your case, that's all blocked. do you really think i wasn't miserable too? i'd think, ""is this how it's supposed to be?"" we'd console ourselves with the thought that sex wasn't everything, that in other respects we were happy. talk about deluding ourselves. you're forgetting certain unpleasant details. be so kind as to refresh my memory. you know what you did? you cashed in on your sex organs. they were a bargaining chip. a night of sex for a night of peace. good behavior earned me a lay. bad behavior or criticism made you withdraw. it was grotesque the way you carried on. you were worse than any whore! - you would never face the truth! - what goddamned truth? some sort of female truth, or your truth? you're completely out of your mind! am i supposed to be a doormat? am i a substitute for your mother? all that carping about how i neglected our home! - that's not true! - yes, it is. that's all i ever heard! you piled the guilt on, you and your parents! i felt inadequate at work and at home, and i was a washout in bed too. i was hedged in by all the griping and endless demands! goddamn you! was it so strange that i used sex for leverage? i was outnumbered, having to fight you, both sets of parents and society! when i think about what i endured, i could scream! i tell you this: never again! you sit there whining about conspiracies. well, it serves you right! i hope you'll have it rammed down your throat that you're a useless parasite. you're being utterly grotesque! so what? that's what i've become! the difference between your grotesqueness and mine is that i won't give in! i intend to face reality the way it is. if there's one thing i truly appreciate, it's being alive. i enjoy overcoming difficulties. i don't ask for any favors... great! then we don't have to feel sorry for each other. we can chuck our guilt out the window. we're almost human. it's a pity we ever met in the first place and decided to live together. what a glorious fiasco. the sooner we sign the papers, the better. we'll divide our worldly goods and go our separate ways, thank you. do you think i don't know what you're thinking? you don't want a divorce! that's preposterous! is it? then prove it by signing the papers right now! all right, i will. johan, be honest now. look at me! you've changed your mind. you don't want a divorce, do you? you were going to tell me today, right? would that be such a crime? you want to hear me admit that i give up? well, i do! i'm sick of paula! i want to come home! don't look at me like that. i'm a failure. i'm going downhill. i'm scared and i have no home. this isn't the right time to ask you to resume our marriage. if you think pity will help... you asked me, and i'm giving you a straight answer. i was tied to you more profoundly than i realized. i needed our home and family... and a regular life to lead. - i'm tired of being alone. - alone? loneliness with paula is worse than being all alone. i can't stand either. i can't talk about this. now you know everything. please send a cab to malmrosgatan 45. thank you. want a lift? you really shouldn't drive. i'll stay here a while longer. please don't brood. - it's none of your business. - come on. - i want you to stay. - i don't want to. you're tired and drunk. let me go! i don't want you to go. - don't be ridiculous. - don't be ridiculous yourself. we never behaved like this in our marriage. let's not start now. give me the key. i don't give a damn what you say! now i can see your well-ordered brain whirling away. ""what do i do now? has he gone crazy? is he going to hit me?"" if you really want to know, i think you're a riot. if i'm such a riot, why aren't you laughing? you look scared to me. let me cancel my cab... what for? they only wait around for ten minutes or so. just take it easy. this will take quite a while. fine. - so what do you want to say? - nothing. i just want to look at you. go ahead. i might have expected this from someone like you. i constantly warn women in the process of a divorce against being alone with their aggrieved husbands. i never thought it would happen to me. shut your mouth. i'm not afraid. i couldn't care less what you do. - shut up! - you're crazy! give me the key. i'll go wash off this blood. i'm not letting you out. you asshole! you bitch! i'll show you! i could kill you! i could kill you! marianne, are you... hey, are you all right? i guess i've only got myself to blame. how about that key? - you want me to help you? - no, please don't. in the middle of the night in a dark house what fun this is! i went out to the summer cottage yesterday and turned on the heat, and i cleaned and stocked up on food. just like old times. when was i there last? seven years ago. - what about you? - i don't spend much time there. henrik's not fond of the seaside. the girls and i go out there occasionally, but they have their own lives nowadays. how's your husband? overworked. he suffers from high blood pressure. how's your wife? she's in italy for a rest cure. isn't it amazing they're both abroad at the same time? it's practically indecent. that's what's so nice. the place hasn't changed much. it's a bit dilapidated. it needs fixing up, but we can't afford it. put the car away or erik will see it and come over. - imagine the gossip if he saw you. - i will, dear. aren't you going to do it now? i'll do it later. this does feel kind of strange. why don't we lie down on the bed? come on. this is silly... but i'm as nervous as if it were the first time. but it's not. come on. it's been nearly a year now. it was the day before my birthday. and today's august 28. you seduced me. i did. - did you ever go see the last act? - no. we must have looked funny sneaking out of the theater. - what made you decide to do it? - i don't know. the second i entered the theater, i saw you sitting there all alone. you looked so lonely. it seemed natural to pounce on you. i was terribly pleased. so was i. you said, ""let's go."" and you blushed. no wonder. i had such a hard-on. you got me pretty hot too. we hadn't seen each other for two whole years. that's right. two years. and now it's our first anniversary. no. what do you mean? it's not our first anniversary. it's our 20th. we got married 20 years ago. that's right. twenty years. an entire lifetime. we've spent a whole grown-up life together. isn't that strange? my darling... my sweetheart. it feels strange to be in this wretched old bed together. our hotel rooms were better. more anonymous. it was wrong of us to come here. we should have gone to denmark. there wasn't time. this is fine. it isn't fine at all. i know. we'll call fredrik. he has a cottage nearby. how will we get in? - i expect a neighbor has a key. - this'll never work. there's no harm in trying. fredrik? johan here. how are you? i've never been better. listen, this is a delicate matter. are you alone? could i possibly borrow your cottage for the weekend? exactly, but it's not what you think. very pretty. young? almost too young. it's a sticky situation. thanks! that's great. i owe you one. don't say a word to birgit. women don't understand things like this. right then. the key's under the stone step. fine. yes, blonde. with a fabulous figure. i'll call you. i really appreciate this. thanks. give my love to birgit. no, better scratch that. bye. - here it is. - nice place. here's the stone step. it must be here. - let's clean up. - yes, let's. what's wrong? are you crying? you're so touching. i'm being silly. touching? well, i'll be damned. it's the truth. my dear, beloved johan. - you've grown so small. - you think i've shrunk too? you're better this way. soft and gentle. you used to look so tense and guarded. you don't say. are people mean to you? i don't know. i've stopped being on the defensive. someone said i'd gone slack and gave in too easily. it's not true. but i've accepted my true dimensions with a certain sense of humility. it makes me kind... and a bit mournful. you had such great expectations. no, you're wrong. those were my family's expectations. i really wanted to live up to them though. you wanted to know how things are with my husband? getting married was a big mistake. we looked on it as a joke. when did you meet? a few years ago. to be frank, it was a sexual affair. i see. henrik is very... how should i put this? convincing in that respect. he truly enjoys sex. and he made me realize that i felt the same way. i wasn't all that keen on it before. so i remember. - you don't like this subject, do you? - no, i don't. but it can't be helped. i was obsessed by this new sensation. i felt insatiable. how nice. for you, i mean. i became very attached to henrik, and he was pretty fond of me. but it wasn't long before i caught him with other women. what do you know. i was hurt and humiliated. even jealous. - jealous? you? - can you imagine? there was this violent scene, and i told him to go to hell. - well, did he? - yes. he did. he said i was too histrionic, and then he left. later i begged him to come back. johan, you look so thoughtful. i was just thinking how everything's fine, that's all. fantastic. couldn't be better. only i can't take it! i knew you didn't want to hear the truth. do you really think i care about your orgasms with that workaholic? i applaud your emancipation. most impressive. you should write a novel. the women's lib movement would rejoice. i hope you're not as stupid as you sound. i don't give a damn! suddenly it matters terribly. no, not really. it's just a taste of the marvelous things life has to offer. think of the awareness we've gained. it's magnificent. almost fantastic. we've discovered ourselves. it's unbelievable. one faces up to his insignificance, the other, to her greatness. here we are, bad-mouthing our spouses. they're almost right here in this room with us. it's mental group sex to the max! it's like a textbook on life. it's fabulously clever, but i can't stand it. i know what you mean, but i don't find it terrible. i can't abide this cold light directed on my every endeavor. how i battle with futility. i console myself with the thought that life is what you make of it. but it's of no comfort. i want something to long for. i don't feel the same way. i realize that. i persevere. i enjoy myself. i rely on common sense and my gut feeling. they work in tandem. i'm content with my direction. time has given me a third partner: experience. you should be a politician. - maybe you're right. - good lord. i like people. i enjoy negotiation, prudence, compromise. rehearsing your campaign speech? am i so impossible? only when you preach. i won't say another word. promise me: no more intimate truths tonight. i promise. promise me you won't mention that orgasmic athlete again. not a word. promise to rein in your awful levelheadedness. that will be difficult, but i'll try. could you possibly... i say possibly... use your boundless feminine powers sparingly? i see that i'll have to. all right, then. let's go to bed. what is it? there, there. come, sit here beside me. there, there. what brings on nightmares? what do you think causes them? - maybe it's something you ate. - you think so? unless there's something in your well-ordered world you can't get at. hold me. i'm shivering, even though i'm hot. i might be coming down with something. the girls have been sick. you'll feel better soon. pull the covers up. - that's nice. - what were you dreaming about? we were crossing a dangerous road. i wanted you and the girls to hold on to me. but my hands were missing. all i had left were stumps. i'm sliding around in soft sand. i can't get a hold of you. you're all up there on the road, and i can't reach you. what a horrible dream. - johan? - yes, my dear. - are we living in utter confusion? - you and i? - no, all of us. - what do you mean? i'm talking about fear, uncertainty and ignorance. do you think that secretly we're afraid we're slipping downhill and don't know what to do? yes, i think so. is it too late? yes. but we shouldn't say things like that. only think them. have we missed something important? - all of us? - no, you and i. what would that be? at times i can read your mind, and i feel such tenderness that i forget myself. without having to efface myself. it's a new sensation. do you understand? i understand. sometimes it grieves me that i've never loved anyone. i don't think i've ever been loved either. that distresses me. now you're being dramatic. - am i? - i know what i feel. i love you in my selfish way. and i think you love me in your fussy, pestering way. we love each other in an earthly and imperfect way. but you're so demanding. i am. but here i am, in the middle of the night, without much fanfare, in a dark house somewhere in the world, sitting with my arms around you. and your arms are around me. i'm not the most compassionate of men. no, you're not. i don't seem to have the imagination for it. no, you're rather unimaginative. i don't know what my love looks like, and i can't describe it. most of the time i can't feel it. and you really think i love you too? yes, i do. but if we harp on it, our love will evaporate. let's sit like this all night. oh, no, let's not. no? one leg's gone to sleep, my left arm's practically dislocated, i'm sleepy, and my back's cold. then let's snuggle down. yes, let's. good night, my darling. it was good talking to you. sleep well. thanks. same to you."
Bergman,The Seventh Seal,"and when the lamb had opened the seventh seal... there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. and the seven angels who had the seven trumpets... prepared themselves to sound. who are you? i am death. have you come for me? i've long been at your side. yes, i know. are you ready? my flesh is afraid, but i am not. wait a moment. you all say that. but i grant no reprieves. you play chess, do you not? how did you know? i've seen paintings and heard ballads. yes, i am quite a skillful player. you can't be better than me. why play chess with me? that's my business. you're quite right. but as long as i hold out against you, i get to live. and if i win, you set me free. you drew black. very appropriate, don't you think? between a strumpet's legs to lie that's the place for such as i the lord is up in heaven high far away off in the sky while here below on every street it's brother satan you will meet everyone in farjestad spoke of evil omens and other horrors. they say two horses devoured each other last night. graves opened wide, and corpses lay scattered about. four suns hung in the sky yesterday afternoon. can you tell me the way to the inn? did he tell you the way? not exactly. what did he say? nothing. was he mute? no, sire. as a matter of fact, he was quite eloquent. i see. most eloquent. though what he had to say was quite gloomy. good morning. have you had your breakfast? pity i can't eat grass. can you teach me how? we're a little hard up right now. folks in these parts don't care much for juggling. mia, wake up! i have to tell you what i saw! did something happen? i had a vision. no, it wasn't a vision. it was quite real. i see. you had another vision. i really did see her. whom did you see? the virgin mary. did you really? she was so close i could have touched her. she wore a golden crown and a blue robe with golden flowers. she was barefoot, and in her little brown hands she was holding the child and teaching him to walk. she saw me watching her and smiled at me. my eyes filled with tears, and when i wiped them away, she was gone. and there was a great stillness everywhere, in heaven and on earth. you understand? the things you imagine. i see you don't believe me, but it was real. not the reality you see. a different kind. like when you said the devil had painted our wagon wheels red, using his tail for a brush. why must you always bring that up? then we found red paint under your nails. perhaps i did make that up, but only so you'd believe my other visions, the real ones. keep your visions in check... or people will think you're a half-wit, which you're not. at least not yet, as far as i know. though i can't be sure. i didn't ask to have visions. it's not my fault if voices speak to me, the virgin appears to me, and angels and devils like my company. i told you once and for all: i must have my sleep in the morning! i've begged and pleaded, but nothing helps. so now i'm telling you: shut up! mikael. i want a better life for mikael. he's going to be a great acrobat. or perhaps a juggler who can do the one impossible trick. what trick is that? making a ball hang suspended in midair. that's impossible. for you and me. but not for him. you and your dreams. i wrote a song while i lay awake all last night. want to hear it? yes, sing it. i'm very curious. on a lily branch a dove is perched against the midsummer sky he sings so sweetly of jesus christ and there's great rejoicing on high mia, are you asleep? it was a lovely song. i'm not done yet. i heard, but i'll just sleep a bit more. sing me the rest later. all you do is sleep. is this any mask for an actor? i ask you. if the priests didn't pay so well, i'd turn them down. going to play death? scaring decent folk out of their wits with this nonsense! where are we performing? the saints' feast in elsinore on the church steps, no less. why not something bawdy? people prefer it, and it's more fun. idiot! they say an evil pestilence stalks the land. the priests are speculating in sudden death and moral bellyache. what parts are we playing? a fool like you can play the soul of man. now that's a bad part. who decides here? who directs this troupe? i ask you. ""to this law, o fool, there's no retort. your life hangs by a thread... and your time is short."" will the ladies fancy me in this getup? i ask you. jof? what is it? sit still and don't say a word. i'm as silent as the grave. i love you. what's that supposed to be? the dance of death. that's death there? yes, he's dancing off with them. why paint such nonsense? to remind people they're going to die. that won't cheer them up any. why always cheer them up, damn it? why not scare them a bit? they won't look at your paintings. oh, yes, they will. a skull is more interesting than a naked woman. if you scare them they'll think. and if they think they'll get scared. and run into the arms of the priests. i can't help that. you just paint your pictures. i paint things as they are. people can do as they like. some will curse you. well, then i'll paint something amusing. a man's got to live. at least till the plague gets him. the plague? sounds horrible. you should see the boils on the neck... and how the body shrivels up and the limbs flail around like crazed ropes. sounds nasty. nasty indeed. they try to tear the boils right out of their flesh. they bite their own hands, scratch open their own veins, and scream to high heaven. frightened? me? you don't know me. what's that rubbish there? remarkably, the poor wretches think that the plague is a punishment from god. crowds of ""sinners"" wander the land whipping themselves and others to please the lord. they whip themselves? yes. it's a horrible sight. best to hide in a ditch until they pass. got any gin? i've had nothing but water all day. i'm as thirsty as a desert camel. i think i frightened you after all. i want to confess as honestly as i can, but my heart is empty. and the emptiness is a mirror turned toward my own face. i see myself in it, and it fills me with loathing and horror. my indifference to my fellow men has cut me off from their company. i live now in a world of phantoms, a prisoner of my own dreams. yet you don't want to die. yes, i do. what are you waiting for? i want to know. you want a guarantee. call it what you will. must it be so cruelly inconceivable to know god through one's senses? why must he hide in a fog of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles? how can we believe the believers when we don't believe ourselves? what will become of us who want to believe but cannot? and what of those who neither will nor can believe? why can i not kill off this god within me? why must he live on inside me in this painful, humiliating way when i want to tear him out of my heart? why does he remain a mocking reality that i can't shake off? you hear me? i hear you. i want knowledge. not faith or conjecture, but knowledge. i want god to reach out his hand, show his face, speak to me. but he is silent. i cry out to him in the darkness, but sometimes it feels like no one is there. perhaps no one is there. then life is just senseless horror. no man can live facing death knowing that everything is nothingness. most people give no thought to death or nothingness. one day they'll stand on the far edge of life, peering into the darkness. ah, that day. i understand what you mean. we carve an idol out of our fear and call it god. you're upset. death visited me this morning. we're playing chess together. this reprieve will enable me to attend to an urgent matter. what sort of matter? my whole life has been nothing but futile wandering and pursuits, a great deal of talk without meaning. it's all been in vain. i say that without bitterness or self-reproach, knowing that most men's lives are the same. but i want to use my reprieve for one meaningful act. so that's why you're playing chess with death. he's a skillful strategist, but i haven't lost a single piece yet. how will you outwit him? through a combination of bishop and knight... that he has yet to catch on to. next i'll charge his flank. i'll remember that. you tricked me... and cheated me. but we will meet again... and i'll find a way out. we'll meet at the inn... and continue our game there. this is my hand. i can move it. blood pulses through its veins. the sun still stands high in the sky, and i... antonius block... am playing chess with death. my master and i just returned from abroad. understand, my painter friend? the crusades? precisely. we spent ten years in the holy land letting snakes bite us, insects sting us, wild beasts maul us, heathens attack us, bad wine poison us, women infect us, lice eat us, and fever consume us all for the glory of god. for the glory of god. our crusade was so stupid that only a true idealist could have thought it up. what you said about the plague was horrible. it's worse than that. well, wherever you turn, your rump's always behind you. there's a great truth. your rump's always behind you. a profound truth. here you see squire jons. he grins at death, scoffs at the lord, laughs at himself, and smiles at the girls. he lives in a jons-world believable only to himself, ridiculous to all, including himself, meaningless to heaven, and of no interest to hell. your soup stinks like hell. what's it for? she had carnal intercourse with the evil one. and now she's in the stocks. she's to be burned tomorrow, and we must ward off the devil. with that stinking muck? it's the best remedy: blood mixed with the bile of a big black dog. the evil one can't stand the smell. neither can i. have you seen the devil? you mustn't speak to her. is it that dangerous? i don't know, but she's thought to be the cause of this plague. fate's a roguish villain poor friend, you're at his call first you leap and bound then like a worm you crawl must you sing? no. why look so surprised? i steal from the dead. a lucrative business nowadays. no use running off to tell the others. every man saves his own skin. it's as simple as that. don't try to scream. there's no one to hear you, neither god nor man. nothing to be surprised about. i know you, but it's been a long time. you're raval, from the seminary in roskilde. doctor mirabilis, coelestis et diabilis. am i not right? ten years ago you convinced my master to join a noble crusade to the holy land. you look uneasy. stomach bothering you? i suddenly understand the meaning of those ten wasted years. we were too well-off, too satisfied with ourselves. the lord sought to chasten our smug pride. so he sent you to spew your holy venom and poison my master's mind. i acted in good faith. now you know better, huh? you've turned thief. a more suitable and rewarding occupation for scoundrels. isn't that so? oh, i'm not a bloodthirsty man. but next time we meet, i'll mark up your face like they do with petty scoundrels of your kind. i just stopped in to fill my waterskin. jons is the name. a pleasant, talkative young man who thinks only kind thoughts and performs only noble deeds. farewell, my lass. i could have raped you, but i've tired of that kind of love. it gets a little dry in the end. come to think of it, i'll need a housekeeper. are you a good cook? i'm a married man, but with any luck my wife is dead by now, so i'll be needing a housekeeper. don't stand there gaping, damn it! i saved your life! you owe me a great deal! damn jugglers! they're making fools of themselves. stop that, you tin-headed swine! i'm not in the first part, so i'm going behind the curtain. don't stand there gaping, you blockheads! the horse sits in the tree and crows wide is the path but narrow is the gate the black one dances on the shore the hen mews in a lake so dark the day is red but the fish is dead the black one crouches on the shore the serpent flutters high in the sky the virgin is pale but the mouse is content the black one runs on the shore the ram hisses through his two teeth the gust is strong and the waves crash the black one makes dung on the shore the sow lays eggs and the cat sows the night is like soot and the dark remains the black one stays and stays and stays on the shore god has sent his punishment down upon us. you shall all perish from the black death. you there, gaping like cattle, and you sitting there in your glutted complacency, don't you know that this could be your final hour? death stands at your back. i see the crown of his head gleaming in the sun. his scythe flashes above your heads. which of you will he strike down first? you there, staring like a goat will nightfall see your mouth twisted into its last unfinished gasp? you, woman... blooming with lust for life and pleasure will you grow pale and wither before the dawn? you there... with your bulbous nose and idiotic grin do you have another year to defile the earth with your refuse? don't you obstinate fools know you're going to die? today, tomorrow, the next day you're all doomed. you hear me? doomed! lord, have mercy on us in our humiliation. turn thy face not away in loathing and contempt, but be merciful to us for the sake of thy son, jesus christ! all that damned ranting about doom. is that sustenance for modern people? do they really expect us to take it seriously? you laugh at me, sire. but i've read or heard or lived through all the tales men tell each other. even the ghost stories about god the father, jesus christ, and the holy ghost i took them all in without batting an eye. what are you shouting about? i'm plog, the smith, and you're jons, the squire. that may be. have you seen my wife? no, but if she looks like you, i'd do my best to forget i had. then you haven't seen her? maybe she's run off. you know something? quite a lot. but not about your wife. maybe they can help you in the tavern. it's true. the plague is spreading along the west coast. people are dying like flies. business should be good this time of year, but i haven't sold a damn thing! they speak of judgment day, and there's all the evil omens. they say a woman gave birth to a calf's head. people are crazed. they flee and take the plague with them. if all that's true, then we should enjoy life as long as we're still standing. many have died trying to purge themselves in fire, but better to die pure than live for hell, the priests say. this is the end that's what it is. no one dares say it aloud, but this is the end. people are crazed with fear. you're scared yourself. i'm scared as hell! judgment day becomes judgment night, when the angels descend and graves open. it will be a terrible sight. want this bracelet? you can have it cheap. i can't afford it. it's genuine silver. it's nice, but i'm sure it's too expensive. excuse me, but have any of you seen my wife? is she missing? they say she's run off. run off? with an actor. an actor? if her taste is that bad, let her go. you're right. my first thought, of course, was to murder her. murder? that's a different story. and the actor with her. the actor? yes, the one she ran off with. whatever for? are you dense, or what? oh, the actor! now i understand. yes, there are far too many of them. guilty or not, you should kill him just for being an actor. listen, you. you're lying to the smith. me? lying? you're an actor too. a friend of yours probably ran off with his old lady. are you an actor too? me, an actor? i'd hardly call myself that. we should kill you too. it's only logical. you're very funny. you've turned pale. guilty conscience? you're funny. don't you think he's funny? i see you don't. perhaps we should mark up your face like they do with petty scoundrels of your kind. what have you done with my wife? you mean to hurt me? why? have i offended anyone or got in the way? i'll leave right now and never come back. stand up so everyone can hear you. speak louder. show us your acting skills: stand on your head. what have you done with my wife? get up and dance! no, i can't. imitate a bear. i can't imitate a bear. we'll see about that. get up! be a good bear. i can't be a bear anymore. remember what i said i'd do if we met again? i always keep my word! what's his name? mikael. how old is he? over a year now. he's big for his age. you think so? yes, i guess he is. you were in that performance earlier. was it awful? you're prettier without that paint on your face, and this dress suits you better. you think so? jonas skat ran off and left us, so we're in a real fix now. is that your husband? jonas? no. the other one's my husband. his name is jof. oh, him. now it's just the two of us. we'll have to do those confounded tricks again. you do tricks too? oh, yes. and jof is a good juggler. will mikael be an acrobat too? jof wants him to be. but you don't? i don't know. perhaps he'll become a knight. that's not much fun either. no, you don't look happy. no. are you weary? why? i'm in dull company. you mean your squire? no, not him. who then? myself. i understand. do you really? yes, i understand quite well. i've often wondered why people torment themselves so. mia. jof! what is it? jof, where have you been? come sit down. where have you been? let me see. why'd you go to that tavern? you drank there, of course. i didn't drink a drop! i suppose you sat boasting about your angels and devils. people don't look kindly on those kinds of tales. i never said a damned word about angels! then you were singing and dancing again. you're always performing. people don't like that either. look what i bought for you. you couldn't afford this. i bought it anyway. oh, how they beat me! why didn't you hit them back? i just get frightened and angry. i never get a chance to hit back. but boy, did i get angry! i roared like a lion. were they scared? no, they just laughed. doesn't he smell nice? he's so solid. you're a sturdy one. a real little acrobat. this is my husband, jof. good evening. you have a fine son there. he'll bring you much joy. yes, he's a fine boy. have we nothing to offer our guest? nothing for me, thank you. i picked wild strawberries this afternoon. and there's milk fresh from the cow. that we had permission to take. we'd be honored if you'd share our humble meal. sit down and i'll bring it. please. where are you headed now? the saints' feast in elsinore. i'd advise against that. why, if i may ask? the plague has spread along the southern coast. tens of thousands are dying. ah, there's no end to trouble in life, is there? come with me through the forest. you can stay at my castle or follow the eastern coast. it'll be safer. these strawberries were growing up on the hillside. i've never seen any so big. just smell! i wish you a hearty appetite. my humble thanks. your offer is attractive, but i must think about it. it would be nice to have company through the forest. i've heard it's full of trolls and ghosts and bandits. it's not a bad idea, but i must think it over. with skat gone, i'm in charge now. i'm director of the entire company now. ""i'm director of the entire company now."" some strawberries? that man saved my life. come join us, my friend. jons the squire offers his thanks. oh, how lovely this is. for a little while. almost always. one day is like another. nothing strange about that. summer is better than winter, of course, because you aren't freezing. but spring is best of all. i wrote a song about spring. i'll get my lyre not now, jof. our guests may not care for your songs. by all means. i write songs myself. you see? i have one about a randy fish i bet you've never heard. and i guess you're not going to. some don't appreciate my art, and i wouldn't impose, sensitive soul that i am. people have such troubles these days. it's always better being a couple. do you have no one? i had once. where is she now? i don't know. you look so solemn! was she your beloved? we were newly married. we played and laughed endlessly. i wrote songs to her eyes, her nose, her beautiful little ears. we hunted together. at night we danced, and the house was full of life. how about some strawberries? faith is a heavy burden, you know? it's like loving someone out in the darkness who never comes, no matter how loud you call. how unreal all that seems now sitting here with you and your husband. how insignificant all of a sudden. now you don't look so solemn. i will remember this moment. the stillness, the dusk... these wild strawberries, this bowl of milk... your faces in the evening light. mikael asleep... jof with his lyre. i'll try to remember what we spoke of... and i'll hold that memory in my hands like a bowl full to the brim with fresh milk. and it will be a sign for me... and a source of great satisfaction. i've been waiting. forgive me. i was detained. since i gave away my strategy, i beat a retreat. please. it's your turn. what are you so happy about? that's my secret. of course. i take your knight. as you were meant to. did you trick me? of course! you fell right into my trap. check. why do you laugh? never mind my laughter. just save your king. you're very sure of yourself. our game amuses me. your move. and be quick. i'm in a hurry. i know you have much to do, but our game must proceed at its own pace. will you be escorting those jesters through the forest? the ones called jof and mia, who have a little son? why do you ask? no reason. have you seen jons? we must be going. i think he's in the tavern. god in heaven! if it isn't plog the smith! are you blubbering here all by yourself? look at the smith, moaning like a rabbit drowning in piss. your wife again? yes, i have yet to find her. it's hell with women and hell without them. best to kill 'em while you're still having fun. nagging and pig swill. screaming babies and stinking diapers. sharp nails and sharp words. the devil's own aunt for a mother-in-law. and when you climb into bed to get some sleep then it's a different tune. sobbing and moaning to wake the dead. ""why don't you kiss me good night?"" ""why don't you sing me a song?"" ""why don't you love me like before?"" ""you didn't notice my new dress."" ""all you do is turn over and snore."" damn it all! damn it all? she's gone now. rejoice! i'll twist their noses off with pliers and bash their chests in with a hammer. i'll give them a nice little tap on the head with a sledgehammer. there he goes blubbering again. maybe i love her. maybe you love her? listen, you big misguided ham shank: love is nothing but lust, lust, and more lust, with a lot of cheating, lies, and general tomfoolery thrown in. it hurts all the same. of course it does. love is the blackest of all plagues, and the only pleasure would be to die of it. but it almost always passes. no, mine won't. yes, yours will too. only a few wretched fools die of love. if everything is imperfect in this imperfect world, love is most perfect in its perfect imperfection. you're lucky, with that oiled jaw of yours. you believe your own twaddle. who says i believe it? but ask for a word of advice and i'll give you two. i'm a man of learning, after all. jons, could i go with you through the forest? i'm so lonely... and they'll just laugh at me at home. just don't blubber all the time, or we'll leave you behind. little brother! watch out, jons! that one's a fighter, and off his rocker. right now he's a sniveler. i'm sorry if i hurt you. i have such a confounded temper. shake hands. give me a hug, little brother. thanks. maybe later. we're in a hurry at the moment. but thanks. look! what's this i see? you see something? who's that i spy at the forest's edge if not my own dearly beloved with actor in tow! watch out! it's the filthy smith who insulted my beloved lady, the fair kunigunda. what did you call her? kunigunda. are you deaf now too? her name is lisa. strumpet lisa. rumpy, smutty, slutty lisa. he's so vulgar! or think of another word yourself for ""tramp""... you gilded shithead! vulgar brute! you stubble-headed bastard of seven mangy mongrels, if i were in your lice-infested rags, i'd feel such boundless shame about my own person that i would immediately rid nature of my own mortifying countenance. be careful, you perfumed dung heap. dung heap. or else... i'll blow you down to actors' hell with one great fart... where you can sit and recite monologues. recite monologues to each other till dust runs out the devil's ears! bravo! and i'll prod you in the belly so hard your guts will run out your ears. and i'll punch you so hard that you'll never again perform your tricks for turks and cannibals. why are you laughing? this is serious. in southern lands there are human-like animals called apes. what of it? just mentioning it. my dear little plog. what? darling plog, forgive me for everything. she'll start crying any minute. i have to cry. it's just too dreadful. you can't imagine how horribly that man deceived me. look here, kunigunda. truth be told next it'll be his favorite dish. plog, when we get home, i'll fix you pork dumplings with rutabagas and lingonberries. that's your favorite, isn't it, my dear little plog? yes, but first i have to kill him. yes, do that. kill him good and proper. i can't stand him anymore. good lord, why did you give us woman? he's nothing but a false beard, false teeth, false smiles, and rehearsed lines, empty as a jug. just kill him! dear plog... if you thought i'd try to justify my so-called reality, you were wrong. kill me. i'll thank you afterward. what's that? the actor sows emotional confusion that's half the battle. don't just stand there gaping. he has to put up a fight, or i can't kill him. he has to at least provoke me. my friends, i will plunge this dagger into my breast... and my unreality will soon be transformed into a new, solid reality: an absolutely tangible corpse. hold on a minute. i didn't mean any harm. i forgive you, kunigunda. farewell, my friend. pray for me sometime. oh, dear! i didn't mean it like that. i was beginning to like him. he's dead. totally, enormously dead. the deadest actor i've ever seen. this is all terribly sad, but it's his own fault, poor thing. and this is what i'm married to! now you have your little lisa back. happy now? jons... just between you and me, isn't life yes, it is. but don't think about that now. it's crazy, that's what it is. i played that scene well. i'm quite the actor. now to find a tree i can climb up... so no bears, wolves, or ghosts can get me. tomorrow i'll look for jof and mia, and off we'll go to elsinore. i'll sing myself a little song. i am a little bird who sings whate'er he will workmen in the forest. they're cutting down my tree! hey, you pupated pecker, what are you doing to my tree? can't you at least answer? courtesy costs nothing. who are you? i'm cutting down your tree because your time is up. you can't. i don't have time! you don't say. i have a performance! canceled on account of death. but my contract! terminated. my family, my children skat, you should be ashamed! yes, i am ashamed. are there no reprieves or exemptions for actors? no, not in this case. no loopholes? no exceptions? the moon's come out from behind the clouds. good. now we'll see the road better. i don't like the moon tonight. the trees are so still. because there's no breeze. he means they're unusually still. it's completely quiet. if only we could hear a fox. or an owl. or a human voice... besides our own. where are you going? the execution grounds. ah, yes, the witch. why burn her at night when people need diversion? shut up, by all the dev by all the saints. the devil is with her. then you're eight brave men. we've been paid. this is a volunteer job. can you hear me? they say you've been in league with the devil. why do you ask? not out of idle curiosity, but for very personal reasons. i too want to meet him. why? i want to ask him about god. he must know... or no one does. you can see him anytime you wish. how? you must do as i say. look into my eyes. well, what do you see? do you see him? i see dumb terror in your eyes. nothing else. no one? nothing? no. isn't that him behind you? no. there's no one there. he's with me everywhere. i need only reach out my hand and i feel his. he's with me even now. the fire won't hurt me. did he say that? i know. did he say that? i know! you must see him too. the priests could see him, and the soldiers too. they're so afraid of him that they dare not touch me. why did you crush her hands? it wasn't us. who, then? ask the monk over there. what did you do to that girl? do you never stop asking questions? no. never. yet you get no answers. i thought we might kill all the soldiers, but she's nearly dead already. i told you to be careful! don't go near her! take this. it will stop the pain. what does she see? can you answer that? she feels no pain now. you didn't answer my question. who's watching over that child? the angels? god? satan? or just emptiness? emptiness, sire. that can't be! look in her eyes. her poor brain's just made a discovery: emptiness in the moonlight. no! we stand by helpless, arms hanging at our sides, for we see what she sees, and her terror is ours. poor child. i can't stand it! he sings so sweetly of jesus christ and there's great rejoicing on high it will soon be dawn... but the heat hangs in the air like a damp blanket. i'm so afraid! we know something's going to happen to us, but we don't know what. judgment day, perhaps. judgment day. give me some water! i have the plague! don't come past that stump. i'm afraid of dying! i don't want to die! won't you have pity on me? help me. at least talk to me! it's no use. absolutely no use. i'm sure of that. i'm dying. i'm... what will happen to me? will no one console me? have you no compassion? can't you see that i'm will no one help me? just a little water. it's pointless. utterly pointless. i tell you, it's pointless. help me! don't you see i'm trying to console you? shall we finish our game? it's your move. i take your queen. i didn't see that. what is it? i see something dreadful. i can hardly even tell you. what is it? the knight is playing chess over there. so i see. nothing dreadful about that. don't you see who he's playing? he's all alone. you mustn't scare me no, he's not alone. who's with him? death. he's playing chess with death himself. you mustn't say such things. we have to get out of here. we can't do that. we have to try. they're engrossed in their game. they won't notice if we slip away. your move, antonius block. have you lost interest in our game? lost interest? on the contrary. you look anxious. are you hiding something? nothing escapes you, does it? nothing escapes me. no one escapes me. i am worried, it's true. you're afraid. i've forgotten how the pieces were. i haven't. you can't get off that easily. i see something interesting. what do you see? mate at the next move. true. was your reprieve of some use? yes, it was. i'm glad. i'll be leaving you now. when next we meet... you and your companions' time will be up. will you reveal your secrets then? i have no secrets. so you know nothing? i know nothing. what a strange light. it's the thunderstorm that comes at dawn. no, it's something else, something terrible. you hear that roaring in the forest? probably the rain. no, it's not the rain. he saw us. he's chasing us. he's caught up! he's coming toward us! climb inside, mia! quick! the angel of death is passing by... and he's very large. you feel how cold it is? i heard from returning crusaders that you were on your way home. i waited for you here. the others all fled from the plague. don't you recognize me anymore? you've changed too. now i can see it's you. somewhere in your eyes... somewhere in your face... only hidden and frightened... is the boy who went away so many years ago. that's all over now... and i'm a little tired. do you regret having gone? no... i regret nothing. but i'm a little tired. i can see that. my friends are over there. have them come in. i'll set the table for breakfast. ""and when the lamb had opened the seventh seal... there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. and the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. the first angel sounded his trumpet... and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood... and they were cast upon the earth. and a third part of the earth was burnt up... and a third part of the trees was burnt up... and all the green grass was burnt up. and the second angel sounded his trumpet... and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea. and a third part of the sea became blood."" was anyone there? no, sire. i saw no one. ""and the third angel sounded his trumpet... and there fell a great star from heaven... burning as if it were a lamp. and the name of the star is called wormwood."" good morning, noble lord. i am karin, the knight's wife, and i bid you welcome to my house. i'm a smith by trade, and quite good, if i say so myself. my wife lisa. curtsy to the noble lord, lisa. she's a handful sometimes, and we had a little spat, but no worse than most people. out of our darkness we call to thee, o lord. o god, have mercy on us, for we are small and frightened and ignorant. in the darkness where you claim to be, where all of us probably are, there's no one to hear your cries or be moved by your suffering. dry your tears and mirror yourself in your own indifference. god, you who are somewhere, who must be somewhere... have mercy on us. my herbs could have purged you of your anxieties about eternity, but now it's too late. even so, feel the immense triumph of this final moment, when you can still roll your eyes and wiggle your toes. quiet, quiet. i will be quiet, but under protest! it is finished. i see them, mia. over there, under the dark, stormy sky. they're all there: the smith and lisa, the knight, raval, jons, and skat. and death, the grim master, bids them dance. he commands them to hold hands and dance in a long line. the stern master leads the way with his scythe and hourglass. but skat dangles at the end with his lyre. they dance away from the dawn in a solemn dance, away to the dark country, while the rain runs down over their faces... and washes away their salty tears. you and your visions."
Bergman,Wild Strawberries,"in our relations with other people, we mainly discuss and evaluate their character and behavior. that is why i have withdrawn from nearly all so-called relations. this has made my old age rather lonely. my life has been full of hard work, and i am grateful. it began as toil for bread and butter and ended in a love for science. i have a son, also a doctor, who lives in lund. he has been married for many years. they have no children. my old mother is still alive and is very active, in spite of her age. my wife karin has been dead for many years. dinner is served, professor borg. thank you. i am lucky in having a good housekeeper. perhaps i should add that i am an old pedant, which at times has been rather trying for myself and those around me. my name is isak borg, and i am 78. tomorrow i shall receive an honorary degree in lund cathedral. wi ld strawberri es in the early hours ofjune 1 st, i had a weird and very unpleasant dream. i dreamt that during my morning walk i lost my way among empty streets with ruined houses. are you ill? miss agda, please prepare some breakfast. i'm taking the car. please, professor! go back to bed and i'll bring you coffee at 9:00, and we'll leave at 10:00 as planned. oh, well, i'll go without breakfast. and who will pack your tails? - i will do it myself. - and what about me? you can come in the car or fly. please yourself. i've looked forward to seeing you get your honorary degree. and we had arranged everything so nicely, and now you're taking the car. the ceremony isn't until 5:00. if i leave at once, i've got 14 hours before the ceremony. you'll ruin everything! what about your son who is expecting you at the airport in malmo? you can think up an explanation. if you go by car, i won't come at all. now listen, miss agda! take the car, and you'll ruin the greatest day of my life. we're not married, miss agda. i thank god for that every night. i've used my common sense for 74 years, and it won't let me down now. is that your last word? yes. but i shall say plenty to myself about selfish, crabby old men who never think of those who have served them faithfully for 40 years. incredible that i have put up... with your bossing for so long. just give the word, and i'll leave tomorrow. i'm going by car anyway, and you can do as you damn well please. i happen to be grown-up and needn't take orders from you. no one can pack like you, miss agda. really? old sourpuss. shall i boil you a couple of eggs? yes, please, if you will be so extremely kind. the faculty should have made me honorary idiot. i'll calm the old girl down with a present. i hate resentful people. i wouldn't hurt a fly, let alone miss agda. toast? no, don't trouble yourself on my account. what are you cross about? don't you want a cup? good morning, uncle isak. well, well, why is my daughter-in-law up at this hour? who can sleep when you and aunt agda are making such a row? there has been no row. no, not at all. you're taking the car to lund? yes. can i come with you? you're going home? yes, i want to go home. home to evald? you don't need to ask why. i would take the train if i could afford it. of course you may ride with me. i'll be ready in ten minutes. good heavens! please don't smoke. i can't stand cigarette smoke. i forgot. there should be a law forbidding women to smoke. beautiful weather. yes, but sultry. - i think we'll have a thunderstorm. - so do i. no, give me a cigar anytime. that's stimulating and relaxing. that's a vice for men. and what vices may a woman have? weeping, giving birth and speaking ill of her neighbors. how old are you really, uncle isak? why do you ask? no reason. why? i know why you asked. oh, well. don't pretend. you don't like me. you never have. i only know you as a father-in-law. why are you going home? on impulse. nothing more. evald happens to be my son. so he is. evald and i are very much alike. we have our principles. you don't need to tell me that. now, this loan, for instance. i know exactly what you're going to say. he should have paid it back when he became an associate professor. it's a matter of honor for him to pay back 5,000 a year, and so on, and so on. a promise is a promise. for us, it means that we never can be free together, and that your son works himself to death. you have your own income. especially when one considers the fact that you're filthy rich and don't need the money. a promise is a promise. and i know evald respects that. perhaps. but he also hates you. what do you have against me? shall i be frank? yes, i'm asking you. you're a selfish old man, uncle isak. you're utterly ruthless and never listen to anyone but yourself. but you hide it all behind your old-world manners and charm. beneath your benevolent exterior, you're as hard as nails. but you can't fool us who have seen you at close quarters. remember when i came to you a month ago? i had a stupid idea that you might help evald and me. so i asked to stay with you for a week or two. remember what you answered? i said i'd be delighted. perhaps you've forgotten, but you said, ""don't try to draw me into your marital squabbles. i don't give a damn. you and evald must make the best of it."" did i say that? - not only that. - oh, no. these were your very words: ""i have no respect for mental suffering, so don't come lamenting to me. if you need therapy, you'd better see a shrink. or why not a minister? it's in fashion now."" did i say that? your judgments are very categorical, uncle isak. i should hate to depend on you. i have liked having you about the house. like a cat. a cat or a human being. you're a fine young woman, and i'm sorry you dislike me. - i don't dislike you. - really? - i feel sorry for you. - sorry? i'd like to tell you about a dream i had this morning. i'm not very interested in dreams. no. no, of course not. where are you going now? i want to show you something. we lived here every summer during the first 20 years of my life. there were ten of us children. perhaps you knew that. does anyone live here now? no, not this summer. i'll go swimming, if you don't mind. we have plenty of time. yes, by all means, do. the place where wild strawberries grow! perhaps i got a little sentimental. perhaps i got a little tired and felt a bit sad. it's not impossible that i began to think of this and that, associated with places where i played as a child. i don't know how it happened, but the day's clear reality dissolved into the even clearer images of memory that appeared before my eyes with the strength of a true stream of events. sara. sara, it's your cousin isak. well, i've become quite old, of course, so i don't look the same. but you, you haven't changed at all. good morning, sweet cousin. what are you doing? picking strawberries, silly. can't you see? and who shall be favored with these delicious berries picked in the early morn by a lovely young woman? nonsense. you know quite well that it's uncle aron's name day today. i forgot to make a present. so he'll get a basket of wild strawberries instead. i'll help you. you see, sigbritt and charlotta made a tapestry and angelica baked a cake, and anna has painted a really good picture, and kristina and birgitta wrote a song that they'll sing to him. that's the best one. uncle aron is stone-deaf. he'll be very pleased, and you're stupid. and you have a darned cute nape. you know you shouldn't do that. - says who? - i say. besides, you're an unusually insufferable young man who thinks he's really something. i'm your cousin, and you're in love with me. with you! come and be kissed on the lips. if you don't behave, i'll tell isak you're always trying to kiss me. little isak! i could beat him up with one arm. you know quite well that isak and i are secretly engaged. so secretly, everyone knows it. it's not my fault that the twins let the cat out of the bag. when is the wedding? when is the wedding? i don't know which of you four brothers is the least conceited, but i think it's isak. isak is the nicest, anyway. and you're the horridest, nastiest, silliest, stupidest... i can't find the words to describe you! admit you've got a weak spot for me. and you reek of cigars. it's a nice manly smell. and the twins, who know most things, say you've been up to no good with that berglund girl. she's not a nice girl, the twins say. and i agree. how pretty you are when you blush. you must kiss me. i can't bear it any longer. now that i think of it, i'm madly in love with you. - you're just saying that. - no. and the twins say that you're mad about girls. is that true? oh, look what you've done! and what will isak say, who really loves me? i'm so sad! you've hurt me so! you've made a bad woman of me. at any rate, nearly. i never want to see you again, at least not before brunch. i have to hurry. help me pick up the strawberries. oh, and now i've got a stain on my apron! where's isak? out fishing with papa, and they can't hear the gong. anyway, papa said not to wait with brunch. in jesus' name we take our seat. bless, o lord, this food we eat. amen. benjamin, go and wash your hands at once. how old do you have to be to learn cleanliness? i have. sigbritt, pass angelica the porridge. your fingernails are filthy. hagbart, pass the bread. don't take so much butter. charlotta, the salt is lumpy. you let it get damp. how often have i told you not to let it sit out? it's paint under my nails. who gathered the wild strawberries for me? - i did. - what? speak up, dear. uncle aron can't hear. i did! fancy your remembering my name day. how kind of you. couldn't uncle have a drink to celebrate? never when papa is not at home. uncle has already had three drinks. we saw him when we went out to bathe at 8:00. so you've picked berries too. thank you. twins, speak when spoken to. and as you didn't make your beds, you can dry the silver. you will do as auntie says. benjamin, don't bite your nails. anna, what are you doing? remember you're not a little girl anymore. i want to give uncle my picture. please, auntie, can't we give him our presents now? - where is your present? - under the table. no, after we've eaten. a very advanced work of art: fritjof and ingeborg. you can't tell which is fritjof! what were sara and sigfrid doing in the wild strawberry patch? we saw you! we saw you! the twins ought to be muzzled. the twins will be quiet or leave the table. no freedom of speech, eh? shut up, you brats. sara's blushing! sara's blushing! sigfrid is blushing too! sigfrid and sara! sigfrid and sara! quiet, everybody! but sara! they're lying! they're lying! isak is so fine and good, so moral and sensitive. he wants us to read poetry and talk about the next life and play four-handed piano. and he only wants to kiss in the dark, and he talks about sin. he's on such a terribly high level, and i feel so worthless. and i am worthless... there's no denying it. but sometimes it seems to me that i'm a lot older than isak, if you know what i mean. and then i think he's a child, although we're the same age. and sigfrid is so bold and exciting, and i want to go home. i don't want to be here all summer and be an object of ridicule for the twins and all of you. i don't want to! i'll speak to sigfrid. if he doesn't behave, i'll make sure he's made to study during the summer holidays. papa will fix that as easy as anything. he too thinks sigfrid is a good-for-nothing and needs to work. poor little isak who's so good to me. how unfair everything is. all will be well, you'll see. listen, now they're singing for uncle aron. how silly to write a song for a deaf old man. how typical of the twins. flowers nod, grasses bow around our lovely house we our uncle aron celebrate and with our song ornament his brow four cheers for uncle aron. hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! i'll run down and meet isak and uncle. you do that. i was overwhelmed by feelings of emptiness and sadness, but was soon awakened from my reveries by the voice of a young girl asking me repeatedly about something. is this your house? no, it's not. you're lucky to be telling the truth. it's my dad who owns the whole headland, including the house. i lived here once. two hundred years ago. oh, yeah? - is that your car up at the gate? - yes, that's my car. looks antique. yes, it's antique, like its owner. so you have self-irony too. that's fantastic. where are you going? i mean, in which direction? well, i'm going to lund. but that suits me perfectly. you see, i'm on my way to italy. i'm honored. my name's sara. silly name, isn't it? my name's isak. it's silly too. weren't they married? no, unfortunately. that was abraham and sara. let's leave, then. i have another lady with me. here she comes. - marianne, this is sara. - hello. we're going to have company as far as lund. sara's off to italy, but she's promised to ride a ways with us. ironic again, but it suits you. let's be off. hey, guys, i've got a lift almost to italy. that's anders and that's viktor and this is father isak. that peach you're gaping at is marianne. what a big bus. yes, there's room for us all. put your luggage in the trunk, if you don't mind. i must tell you, isak, that anders and i are going steady. we're crazy about each other. viktor's the chaperone. daddy insisted. viktor is in love with me too. it's a brilliant move of daddy's. i may have to seduce viktor to get rid of him. i'd better tell you i'm a virgin. that's why i'm so cheeky. and i smoke a pipe. viktor says it's good for you. he's crazy about anything healthy. i was once in love with a woman called sara. no! she was like me, wasn't she? she was, actually. what happened to her? she married my brother sigfrid and had six children. she's 75 now and quite a beautiful old lady. i can't think of anything worse than growing old. oh, dear, now i have put my foot in it. are you all right? i have no excuse. it's all our fault. my wife was driving. are you all right? the murderers must introduce themselves! my name's alman. that's my wife berit. you can see she has been an actress. that's the complication we were discussing when... come here, berit, and say you're sorry. i'm so sorry. it was all my fault. i was just going to hit my husband when that curve appeared. god punishes some people at once, eh, you catholic? let's get your car upright. - oh, never mind us. please. - shut up, sten. some people are unselfish, though you don't think so. my wife is a little nervous. we've had a shock. just look at him measuring his strength with the youngsters, straining his flabby muscles to show off in front of that cute girl. darling, you might have a stroke. my wife likes ridiculing me. i let her. it's psychotherapy. i never know whether my wife is really crying or just playacting. i'll be damned if it isn't real. it happens when you catch a glimpse of death. can't you shut up? my wife can really live a part. for two years, she made me think she had cancer and plagued us with every possible symptom, even though the doctors could find nothing wrong with her. eventually we believed her more than the doctors! it's natural that you're upset, but why not leave your wife in peace for a while? a woman has a right to her tears, eh? don't get in the way of a woman's tears. you are beautiful, but old berit's a bit past her prime. so you can afford to defend her. i sympathize with her. for several reasons. very sarcastic! yet you don't seem in the least hysterical. but little berit is. do you know what that means for me? i gather you're a catholic. quite right. that's how i stand it. we ridicule each other. she has her hysteria. i have my catholicism. so, you see, we need each other. it's only egoism that we haven't killed each other. there it came. that's what is called syncopes, isn't it? very funny. if i'd had a stopwatch, i could have timed the explosion. shut up! shut up! this may be too blunt, but for the children's sake, will you please get out. forgive us, if you can. it was with mixed feelings i saw this region again. i had my first practice here, and my old mother lives nearby. hello there, doctor. so you're in these parts again, doctor? shall i fill it up? pass me the key to the hood. eva! come here a moment! it's dr. borg in person. mom and dad and the whole countryside still talk about him. the world's best doctor. let's call the baby after him. isak akerman... not a bad name for a prime minister. suppose it's a girl. we only have boys. and how's your father these days? oh, dad's getting a bit decrepit. but mom's as lively as a cricket. and you're going to see your mother, doctor? she's amazing. she must be at least 95. - ninety-six. - imagine that. what do i owe you? - this is on eva and me! - absolutely not! don't insult us, doctor. we can do the proper thing too! why should you pay for my gasoline? there are things that can't be paid back... not even with gas. we haven't forgotten. ask anyone around here. they all remember your kindness. maybe i should have stayed here. what do you mean? you said you should have stayed. did i? well, thanks anyway. let me know when the new son arrives, and i'll be the godfather. you know where to find me. during lunch i was in good spirits and told the young people about my years as district medical officer. my stories were quite a success, and i don't think they laughed merely out of courtesy. i had wine with the lunch, and then port with the coffee. ah, when creation shows so much beauty, how radiant must be its source! he is going to be a minister, and viktor a doctor. reciting poetry is against our agreement not to discuss god or science on this trip. it was beautiful! how can anyone today study to become a minister! your rationalism is as dry as dust. i say that modern man... i say that... believes only in himself and his biological death. modern man is a figment of your imagination. man regards death with horror. religion for the people. opium for the aching limb. how sweet they both are! i always agree with the one i spoke with last. once you believed in santa claus... now in god. you never had any imagination! what do you say, professor? whatever i said would be met with tolerant irony, so i'll say nothing. i'm sure they'll be disappointed. no, sara. very, very happy. ""where is the friend i seek at break of day? when night falls, when..."" ""when night falls, i still have not found him."" ""my burning heart shows me his traces..."" are you religious, professor? ""i see his traces wherever flowers bloom. his love is mingled with every air."" ""his voice calls in the summer wind."" not bad for a love poem. i've gone all solemn again for no reason. well, i'm going to call on my mother. i'll be back soon. - may i come? - of course. here comes the thunder. i have just sent you a telegram on your great day. and now you're here. we all have our bright moments, dear mother. is that your wife over there? i don't want to talk to her. she has done us too much harm. no, mother dear. this is evald's wife, marianne. well, let her come and say hello to me. good day, mrs. borg. and why are you gadding about like this? i have been in stockholm for a visit. why aren't you with evald and the child? evald and i have no children. these young people nowadays! i bore ten children. will you please hand me that big box over there. my mother lived in this house. do you remember coming to see her, isak? very well. here are some of your toys. i have been trying to think which of you owned what. ten children, and all dead except isak. twenty grandchildren. evald's the only one who comes to see me. don't get me wrong... i'm not complaining. fifteen great-grandchildren whom i have never seen. i send presents for all their birthdays. i get letters of thanks, but nobody bothers to visit me unless they want to borrow money. oh, i know i'm tiresome. don't think that, mother. and i've one more fault. i don't die. the inheritance isn't being divided up the way these crafty young people had planned. this was sigbritt's doll. she got it when she turned eight. i made the dress myself. but she never cared for it so it went to charlotta. she took care of it... i remember it clearly. do you see who that is? sigfrid was three and you were five. and myself. what a fright one looked in those days. may i have it? by all means. it's only rubbish. and here's a coloring book. i don't know whose it was. they've all put their names in it. kristina has scrawled: ""i love papa more than anything in the whole world."" and birgitta has put: ""i'm going to marry papa."" isn't that funny? i laughed when i saw it. don't you think it's cold in here? no, not particularly. i have felt cold all my life. mostly my stomach. i wonder why. you have low blood pressure. let us have some tea, and we can sit and talk. no, thank you, mother. we won't disturb you any longer. sigbritt's eldest boy will soon be 50. i thought of giving him father's gold watch. it has no hands. does that matter? i remember when sigbritt's boy was a newborn. he used to lie in the lilac arbor at the summer house. now he's turning 50. and little cousin sara used to carry him around and sing to him. she married sigfrid, that good-for-nothing. well, you must go now, or you'll be late for the ceremony. i am very glad you came, and i hope to see you again. give my love to evald. good-bye. where are anders and viktor? they started arguing about god, and then they lost their tempers. and anders tried to twist viktor's arm, and viktor said that was a lousy argument for god's existence. i said they could talk about me instead. then they told me to shut up because i didn't understand the debate, so i left. they went up the hill to fight it out because each insisted... the other had hurt his innermost feelings. - where are they now? - up there. i'll see to them. which one do you like best? which one do you like best? i don't know. anders is going to be a minister... he's a darling. but a minister's wife... viktor's nice too. in a different way. - viktor will go far, of course. - what do you mean? a doctor earns more money. and ministers are out of date. though he has got nice legs and a sweet neck. but how can anyone believe in god? well? does god exist? i dozed off, but was haunted by vivid and humiliating dreams. there was something overpowering in these dream images that bored relentlessly into my mind. have you looked in the mirror, isak? then i'll show you what you look like. you're a worried old man who's soon going to die, but i have all my life before me. that hurt your feelings, after all. no, it didn't hurt. yes, it hurt because you can't bear the truth. the truth is that i've been too considerate. and so became unintentionally cruel. i understand. no, you don't understand. we don't speak the same language. look in the mirror again. no, don't turn away. i see. listen to me. i'm going to marry your brother sigfrid. love is almost a game for us. look at your face now. try to smile! there! now you're smiling. but it hurts so. as professor emeritus, you ought to know why it hurts. but you don't know. you know so much, and you don't know anything. i must go. i promised to keep an eye on sigbritt's baby. poor little thing. hush, baby. sleep. don't be afraid of the wind or the birds or the waves of the sea. i'm here with you, holding you tight. don't be afraid, little one. it will soon be day again. no one will hurt you. i am with you. i am holding you. please come in, professor borg. have you brought your examination book? please identify the bacterial specimen under the microscope. there must be something wrong. not with the microscope. i can't see a thing. please read this text. what does it mean? i don't know. really? i'm a doctor, not a linguist. what you see on the blackboard is a doctor's first duty. don't you know what that is? let me think. take your time. a doctor's first duty... a doctor's... i've forgotten. a doctor's first duty is to ask for forgiveness. of course! now i remember! you have been accused of guilt. i'll make a note that you haven't understood the charge. is it serious? unfortunately, professor. i have a weak heart. i'm an old man. you must be lenient with me. it's only fair. there's nothing about your heart in my papers. do you want to stop the examination? no, for god's sake, no! please diagnose the patient. the patient is dead. what are you writing in my book? - my verdict. - and that is? that you are incompetent. you are also accused of some minor but still serious offenses. callousness, selfishness, ruthlessness. your wife has made the charge. you'll be confronted with her. but my wife has been dead for years! do you think i'm joking? please come with me. you have no choice. many forget a woman who has been dead for 30 years. some cherish a sweet and fading picture, but you can recall this scene at any time. tuesday, may 1 st, 1917. you stood on this very spot. and heard and saw what that man and woman said and did. now i'll go home and tell isak. i know just what he'll say. ""my poor girl, i'm sorry for you."" just as if he were god. then i'll weep and say, ""do you really feel sorry for me?"" he'll say, ""yes, very sorry."" then i'll weep even more and ask him to forgive me. he'll say, ""you mustn't beg my forgiveness. there is nothing to forgive."" but he doesn't mean a word he says because he's cold as ice. and suddenly he gets very tender, and i scream at him that he's mad and that his hypocrisy makes me sick. then he says he'll get me a sedative and that he understands everything quite well. and i tell him it's his fault that i am as i am. and he looks sad and says it is his fault. but he doesn't really care about anything because he's so cold. where is she? gone. all are gone. removed by an operation, professor. a surgical masterpiece. no pain. nothing that bleeds or trembles. how silent it is. a perfect achievement in its way, professor. and the punishment? i don't know. the usual, i suppose. the usual? loneliness. loneliness? precisely. is there no mercy? don't ask me. i don't know. what's this? the children wanted to stretch their legs. but it's still raining. i told them about today and they want to honor you. slept well? yes, but recently i've had the weirdest dreams, as if i must tell myself something i won't listen to when i'm awake. what's that? that i'm dead. although i'm alive. you and evald are very alike. so you've said. he said the same thing. about me? no. about himself. but he's only 38. may i tell you about it? yes, i'd be grateful. a few months ago i wanted to talk to evald, so he drove me down to the sea. it was raining then too. he sat where you sit now. well, you've trapped me. what do you want to say? something unpleasant, of course. i wish i didn't have to. you have found someone else. don't be childish. you tell me in funereal tones that you must talk to me, and then you find it hard to begin. come on, for heaven's sake! don't keep me on tenterhooks! i almost want to laugh now. whatever do you think i'm going to tell you? that i've killed someone, or stolen the faculty funds? i'm going to have a baby. are you sure? the doctor told me yesterday. so that was the secret. i might as well tell you that i intend to have this child. - you've made up your mind? - yes, i have. you know i don't want a child. you'll have to choose between me and the child. - poor evald. - don't ""poor evald"" me! it's absurd to bring children into this world and think they'll be better off than we are. - that's just an excuse. - call it what you want. i was an unwanted child in a hellish marriage. is he even sure i'm his son? that's no excuse for behaving like this. i must be at the hospital at 3:00. i have neither the time nor the desire to discuss this any further. you're a coward. yes. this life sickens me. i will not be forced to take on a responsibility that will make me live for one day longer than i want to. and you know that i mean what i say. i know that this is wrong. there's neither right nor wrong. we act according to our needs. and what are they? yours is a hellish desire to live and to create life. and yours? mine is to be dead. stone-dead. if you want to smoke a cigarette, i don't mind. why have you told me all this? i saw you with your mother, and i was panic-stricken. i don't understand. i thought: that's his mother. an old woman, cold as ice, more forbidding than death. and this is her son, and there are light-years between them. he himself says he's a living corpse. and evald is growing just as lonely, cold and dead. and i thought of the baby inside me. all along the line, there's nothing but cold and death and loneliness. it must end somewhere. but you're going back to evald! to say i can't agree to his conditions. i want this child. no one can take it from me. not even the man i love most of all. can i help you? no one can help me. we are too old. things have gone too far. what happened after your talk? nothing. i left him the next day. hasn't he gotten in touch with you? - i don't want us to get... - to get what? like those two in the car today. i was just thinking of them. it reminded me of my own marriage. but we love each other. long may he live long may he live may he live to be a hundred years old we heard you're celebrating a grand occasion today. with these simple flowers we want to say that we are very impressed that you've been a doctor for 50 years. we know you must be a very wise old man who knows everything about life and has learned all the instructions by heart. thank you. now we must go on. it's getting late. so you did come. evald and i had given up hope. a nice drive is relaxing, isn't it? you'll have to get into your tails at once. good afternoon, marianne. i've told evald you're coming. thank you. that was most kind. so you came after all, miss agda. i considered it my duty. but my pleasure's been spoiled. welcome, father. as you see, i've brought marianne with me. - hello, marianne. - may i put my things upstairs? the guest room as usual, father? let me take your bag. it's rather heavy. - did you have a good trip? - yes, it was pleasant. who are those young people? i don't know. they're nice, and they're off to italy. - they seem nice. - yes, they're very nice. it's a quarter past 4:00. i've bought you new shoelaces. i'm leaving tomorrow, so don't worry. - are you going to a hotel? - no, why? can't we share the bedroom for one more night? unless you object. - give me a hand unpacking? - it's nice to see you. and unexpected. same here. are we going on to the banquet afterwards? yes, i'll just call stenberg and tell him i'll have a lady with me. hurry up, professor! during the ceremony, my thoughts strayed to the day's events, and it was then i decided to write down what had happened. in this jumble of events, i seemed to discern an extraordinary logic. did you enjoy the ceremony? yes, thank you. are you tired, miss agda? i won't deny it. take one of my sleeping pills. miss agda, i am sorry about this morning. are you ill, professor? no. why? i don't like the sound of it. is it so rare for me to say i'm sorry? do you want the carafe on the table? thank you anyway, professor. good night. miss agda, as we have known each other for so many years, don't you think we could call each other agda and isak? no, i don't. why not? have you brushed your teeth, professor? no intimacies for me, thank you. it's all right between us as it is. but we are old now. speak for yourself. a woman is jealous of her reputation. what would people think if we suddenly began to say agda and isak? they would make fun of us. are you always right? almost always. at our age, we should know how to behave. good night, professor. i'll leave the door ajar. you know where i am if you want anything. father isak! you were splendid in the procession. we were terribly proud to know you. an old girl is giving us a lift all the way to hamburg. - anders is mad about her. - oh, be quiet. we just wanted to say good-bye. good-bye. and thank you for your company. it's you i really love, you know. today, tomorrow, always. i'll remember. come on. we have to go now. let me hear from you. - i think uncle is asleep. - evald! yes, father? are you back already? marianne lost the heel on a shoe. so you're going to the dance? i suppose so. - how are you, father? - excellent. - heart all right? - excellent. sleep well. sit down a moment. anything special? how is it to be between you and marianne? forgive my asking. i don't know. it's not my business, but... but wouldn't it... i have asked her to stay with me. shouldn't you... i mean... - i can't live without her. - you mean alone? i can't live without her. that's what i mean. oh, i see. it will be as she wants. and she... she says she'll think about it. about that debt of yours... don't worry, you'll get your money. that's not what i meant. how are you, uncle isak? fine. just fine. i lost a heel. will these shoes do? they're very nice. thanks for coming with me. i like you, marianne. i like you too, uncle isak. if i have been worried or sad during the day, it often calms me to recall childhood memories. i did so on this evening too. isak, there are no wild strawberries left. auntie wants you to look for your papa. we'll sail around and meet you at the other side of the island. i can't find either papa or mama."
Bergman,Winter Light,"our lord, jesus christ, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it unto his disciples, saying: take and eat. this is my body which is given up for you. do this in remembrance of me. likewise he took the cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, drink ye all of it. for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sin. do this, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. let us now pray together, even as our lord jesus hath taught us. our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever. amen. the peace of god be with you. o lamb of god that takest away the sins of the world give us salvation, o merciful lord o lamb of god that takest away the sins of the world hear our prayers, o merciful lord o lamb of god that takest away the sins of the world grant us peace and bless our day look straight ahead and fold your hands. the body of our lord jesus christ, which was given for you. the body of our lord jesus christ. the blood of christ, shed for thee. the blood of christ, shed for thee. the grace and peace of our lord jesus christ be with you all. amen. go in the peace of the lord. thanks. let us pray. we thank thee, almighty father, who, through thy son jesus christ, hast instituted this holy communion to our consolation and bliss. we pray thee: give us grace so to commemoratejesus on earth that we may be partakers in thy great communion in heaven. give thanks and praise unto the lord. praise and thanks be unto the lord hallelujah humble your hearts before god and receive his blessing. the lord bless you and preserve you. the lord let the light of his countenance shine upon you, and be gracious unto you. the lord turn his face toward you and grant you peace. in the name of the father, the son, and the holy ghost. amen. yet, dear lord i bow down in prayer take my hand firmly into thine lead me then, my dearest savior take me to the land divine and where earthly woes are ended and my course is finally run thou wilt take my spirit with thee to share eternity in that house of thine time to go home. - you don't look so good. - i just need some rest. can't reverend broms take the service at frostng$?s? no, he's taking the new car out for a spin. - i bet you have the flu. - my throat's pretty sore. tomas. how did it turn out? - what? - did you find a housekeeper? - no. you won't be able to manage on your own in the long run. i've managed for five years now. why don't you ask mg$?rta lundberg? she's dying to help you out. i'd be glad to ask her. no, thank you. - hello, pastor ericsson. - hello, mr. froevik. - hi there, aronsson. - hi, algot. how are you? thanks for the sermon. can we help you with something? no, i thought i might be of service. well, there was one thing. i need to talk to you, pastor. i'll be at frostng$?s at three. and you'll have time to see me? of course, after the service. i'll be at the church an hour beforehand to turn the heat up. will we be using the same hymns? you don't look well. i've come down with a cold. i bet it's the weather. i always... - right. he has his disability pension from the railway company and a pittance for his services from the church council, i suppose. you have a visitor. mrs. persson would like to have a word. i've got to talk to you, pastor. yes, of course. i'll call you this evening in case you need a hand. thanks, but that's not necessary. please have a seat. good-bye, mr. and mrs. persson. you wished to speak to me? yes. actually, that's not the whole truth. actually, jonas is the one... - but he won't talk about it, so this morning i decided we should come to church and see someone. you see, we're feeling so lost. well, not me so much, butjonas is at his wit's end. could you talk to him, please? of course. how long have you felt troubled? it started last spring. jonas read about china in the papers. the article said the chinese people were brought up to hate... and that it's only a matter of time before china has atom bombs. they have nothing to lose. that's what they wrote. it doesn't worry me all that much. maybe i'm just short on imagination. butjonas can't stop thinking about it, and so we discuss it constantly, though i can't help him much. not with three kids and one on the way. right. everyone feels this dread... to some extent. we must trust god. we live our simple daily lives, and atrocities shatter the security of our world. it's so overwhelming, and god seems so very remote. that's right. i feel so helpless. i don't know what to say. i understand your anguish... but life must go on. why do we have to go on living? the pastor's not feeling well. i shouldn't be bothering you with this. besides, we're powerless to do anything. - let's discuss it. that's impossible. take me home and then come back. you and the pastor need to talk in private. when can you be back? - we live 10 minutes away. - i'll see you in 20 minutes. promise the pastor you'll be here. all right, i promise. is your car in the parking lot? yes, off in the corner. i'll be expecting you within half an hour. i'll make sure he comes. i'll be waiting for you. i'll be waiting right here. what a ridiculous image. oh, it's you. here's something nice and hot. oh, i brought coffee with me. i'm expecting a visitor any minute. don't worry. i won't stay long. it's getting pretty cold out. poor tomas. what is it, tomas? - it wouldn't matter to you. tell me anyway. god's silence. god's silence? god's silence. jonas persson and his wife were here, and i could only spout drivel. yet i had the feeling that each word was decisive somehow. what am i to do? poor little tomas. you should be in bed with a brandy. you're running quite a temperature. why did you take communion? it's a love feast, isn't it? did you read my letter? no. i haven't had the time. you're hopeless. when did it arrive? - yesterday. it's on my desk... - read it later, when you feel like it. another sunday in the vale of tears. i don't feel very well. - want me to feel sorry for you? - yes, please. then you'll have to marry me. oh? you should marry me. why? then i wouldn't have to leave this place. why would you have to leave? as long as i'm a substitute, i can be transferred. far away from you. we'll see what happens. yes, i know. you can't marry me because you don't love me. i've got to go. aunt emma is here and she plans to bake a cake. mg$?rta. yes, tomas. what if mr. persson doesn't return? then you can get some rest... and read my letter. you don't understand. here's the coffee. now what? poor tomas. i really mean it. i'm not being very nice to you. - you don't say. you're impossible sometimes. ""god's silence. god won't speak."" god has never spoken because god doesn't exist. it's as simple as that. now you'll get the flu. that's fine, seeing as it's a gift from you. would you like me to stay? - no, that won't be necessary. you have a lot to learn. says the schoolmarm. you must learn to love. and you can teach me that? i can't. that's not in my power. he has to show up. my love. ""we find it difficult to talk to each other. we're both rather shy, and i tend to retreat into sarcasm."" that's why i'm writing. i have something important to say. do you remember last summer, when that awful rash broke out on my hands? one evening we were in church arranging flowers on the altar, preparing for a confirmation. do you recall what bad shape i was in? my hands all bandaged, and itching so much i couldn't sleep? the skin had flaked off, and my palms were like open sores. we busied ourselves with daisies and cornflowers, or whatever they were, and i was feeling irritable. suddenly i got mad at you and challenged you angrily, asking if you actually believed in the power of prayer. you replied that you did. in a nasty tone i asked if you had prayed for my hands, but it hadn't occurred to you to do so. i melodramatically demanded that you do it then and there. oddly enough, you agreed. your compliance enraged me, and i tore off the bandages. you remember the rest. the sight of those open sores affected you greatly. you couldn't pray. the entire situation disgusted you. i came to understand you later, but you never understood me. we had lived together for some time at that point. almost two years... which at least represented some capital in the face of our emotional poverty. our caresses... and our clumsy attempts to evade the lack of love between us. when the rash spread to my forehead and scalp... i soon noticed how you avoided me. you found me repugnant... though you tried to spare my feelings. then the rash spread to my hands and feet. and our relationship ended. that came as a shock to me. i had to face the fact... that we didn't love each other. there was no way to hide from that fact or turn a blind eye to it. tomas... i have never believed in your faith. mainly because i've never been tortured by religious tribulations. my non-christian family was characterized by warmth, togetherness and joy. god and jesus existed only as vague notions. to me your faith seems obscure and neurotic, somehow cruelly overwrought with emotion, primitive. one thing in particular i've never been able to fathom: your peculiar indifference tojesus christ. and now i'm going to tell you about answered prayers. laugh if you feel like it. personally, i don't believe the two are connected. life is messy enough without taking the supernatural into account. you were going to pray for my weeping hands, but the rash left you dumbstruck with repulsion, something you later denied. i went berserk and tried to provoke you. be quiet! since you can't pray for me, i'll do it myself! god, why have you created me so eternally dissatisfied? so frightened, so bitter? why must i realize how wretched i am? why must i suffer so hellishly for my insignificance? if there is a purpose to my suffering, then tell me, so i can bear my pain without complaint. i'm strong. you made me so very strong in both body and soul... but you never give me a task worthy of my strength. give my life meaning, and i'll be your obedient slave. this autumn i realized that my prayers had been answered. i prayed for clarity of mind, and i got it. i realized that i love you. i prayed for a task to apply my strength to, and i received one. that task is you. this is what the thoughts of a schoolmarm might run to when the phone refuses to ring, when it's dark and lonely. what i lack entirely is the capacity to show you my love. i haven't a clue how to do that. i've been so miserable, i've even considered praying some more. but i still have a shred of self-respect left in spite of it all. my dearest tomas... this turned out to be a long letter. but now i've put down in writing what i never dared say when you were in my arms. i love you. and i live for you. take me and use me. beneath all my false pride and independent airs, i have only one wish: to be allowed to live for someone else. it's so terribly difficult. when i think about it, i can't see how i will be able to pull it off. maybe it's all just a mistake. tell me i'm not wrong, darling. i'm so glad you came. it's been a long wait. i'm sorry i'm late. i didn't mean it as a reproach. please, take your coat off. i've got some nice hot coffee. no, thank you. i don't expect you spend much time at sea this time of year? we just take short fishing trips, that's all. plenty to do ashore? yes, i'm building a new boat over at toernstroem's yard. an excellent establishment. i had my own boat built there, at toernstroem's yard. do you have money worries? forgive me for asking, but things like that can drive a man to despair. that's true. how long have you considered taking your own life? i'm not sure. a long time. have you spoken to a doctor? i mean, are you in good health? as far as i know. it's not unusual to... - do you get along with your wife? karin's all right. she's all right. so it all boils down to this business about china. listen, jonas. i'm going to be frank with you. you know my wife died four years ago. i loved her. my life was over. i'm not afraid to die, and there was no reason for me to hang on. but i did. not for my own sake, but to be of some use. i had great dreams once. i was going to make my mark on the world. the sort of ideas you have when you're young. i knew nothing of evil or cruelty. when i was ordained, i was as innocent as a baby. then everything happened at once. i was a seaman's pastor in lisbon, during the spanish civil war. i refused to see what was going on. i refused to accept reality. my god and i resided in an organized world where everything made sense. you see, i'm no good as a clergyman. i put my faith in an improbable and private image of a fatherly god. one who loved mankind, of course, but me most of all. do you see, jonas, what a monstrous mistake i made? an ignorant, spoiled and anxious wretch makes a rotten clergyman. picture my prayers to an echo-god, who gave benign answers and reassuring blessings. every time i confronted god with the realities i witnessed, he turned into something ugly and revolting. a spider god, a monster. so i sought to shield him from life, clutching my image of him to myself in the dark. the only person i showed my god to was my wife. she supported me, encouraged me and helped me. patched up the holes. our dreams. i'd better be going. no, don't go. i want you to understand why i talk so much about myself. so you realize what a wretch i am, what a poor beggar... - i must be going, or karin will be worried. please stay a little bit longer. let's have a nice, calm discussion. forgive me for talking in such a confused manner, but all this suddenly hit me. if there is no god, would it really make any difference? life would become understandable. what a relief. and thus death would be a snuffing out of life. the dissolution of body and soul. cruelty, loneliness and fear... - all these things would be straightforward and transparent. suffering is incomprehensible, so it needs no explanation. there is no creator. no sustainer of life. no design. god... why have you forsaken me? now i'm free. free at last. i had this fleeting hope that everything wouldn't turn out to be illusions, dreams and lies. i have to get ready. the service at frostng$?s starts at 3:00. i'm coming with you. no. i saw your car, pastor, so i came over. fredriksson's boys found him. just down the hill. it's jonas persson. he shot himself in the head with his rifle. the police superintendent is at the scene. the boys reported it immediately. i met them on my way here. they were terrified. could you please guard the body until the van arrives? good-bye. please call me. good-bye, tomas. maybe we'll talk this week. - do you have any aspirin? - sure, and cough syrup, too. - that might be good. come in. but isn't your aunt visiting? wait in the schoolroom, then. i'll just be a minute. - hello. - good day. whose boy are you? - the strands'. - how old are you? - ten. - what brings you here on a sunday? - i left something in my desk. - what's the dog's name? - jim. is he yours? no. he must be your big brother's, the one who'll be confirmed this year. yes. will you go to confirmation class too? no. why not? i don't know. does your brother find it boring? i don't know. well, good-bye, then. good-bye. hello, johan. what brings you here? i left something in my desk. how's your brother pelle? he's much better. he got out of bed friday. he'll be back in school by the middle of next week. good. give my love to your folks. good-bye. careful, that's hot. it's really for gargling with. you dissolve these tablets in hot water. auntie gave them to me. she swears by them. no, thank you. my aunt often suffers from sore throats and these really help. suit yourself. here's the aspirin. would you like some cold water? - that won't be necessary. you sound so unfriendly. sometimes... - sometimes you sound... as if you hated me. take the whole box if you like. auntie arrived well-stocked. can't i come to frostng$?s with you? i'm going to the persson's place. i can wait in the car. i thought your aunt baked a cake. i need some time on my own. are you trying to get rid of me? don't do this right now. i don't have the strength. why do you want to get rid of me? my dear little tomas, you're getting old. you're dissatisfied with life, but most of all with yourself. and here i am throwing myself in your arms, clouding the issue. or am i forcing it? - you be the judge. you have your dreams, and i pay no attention to them. at times i even despise them. i should have been kinder. - those are just trivialities. - no, they're not. you've been unlucky. i'm so very bossy. don't bother contradicting me. could you just listen to me? sorry, i'm doing all the talking. i feel humiliated by the gossip. no one used to pay much attention to the pastor. he was simply a fixture, though no one knew exactly what he was good for. then the rumors began about you and me. all that tittle-tattle. so that's your reason? you don't have to sneer at me. marry me, then. no. it's hard to plead one's own cause. yes, it certainly is. you can't... you mustn't push me away. how can you be so blind? don't get hysterical. that's what you always say whenever you see me crying. i suppose i am a tad hysterical. calm down. don't alarm your aunt. i can't hold back the tears. just go on talking. i can still hear your every word. i thought i'd found a good excuse. all that stuff about a pastor's reputation. but you didn't bite. and i understand that, since it was a pack of lies. the real reason is that i don't want you. did you hear that? yes. of course i did. i'm tired of your loving care. your fussing. your good advice. your candlesticks and table runners. i'm fed up with your shortsightedness. your clumsy hands. your anxiousness. your timid displays of affection. you force me to occupy myself with your physical condition. your poor digestion. your rashes. your periods. your frostbitten cheeks. once and for all i have to escape this junkyard of idiotic trivialities. i'm sick and tired of it all, of everything to do with you. why didn't you tell me this before? because of my upbringing. i was taught to regard women as beings of a higher order. admirable creatures, unassailable martyrs. and your wife? i loved her. you hear me? i loved her. and i don't love you, because i love my wife. when she died, so did i. i couldn't care less what happens to me. am i making myself clear? i loved her, and she was everything you could never be but insist on trying to be. the way you mimic her behavior is such an ugly parody. i didn't even know her. i'd better be going... before i spout even worse bits of senseless drivel. could it get any worse? stop rubbing your eyes like that. sorry. stare all you like. i can take it. i can barely see you without my glasses. you're all fuzzy, and your face is just a white blob. you're not really real. yes, i see that i did it all wrong from the beginning. i've got to go. i have to talk to mrs. persson. every time i've hated you, i've made an effort to turn it into compassion. you can't make it on your own. you won't survive, tomas dear. nothing can save you. you'll hate yourself to death. can't you be quiet? can't you leave me alone? can't you just shut up? would you like to come along? do you really want me to? or is that fear talking? suit yourself. but i'm asking you to come. of course i'll come. i don't have much choice, do i? auntie, i'll be back by 6:00. she must be asleep. i'll just go check the stove. your husband is dead, mrs. persson. they've taken him to the infirmary, but there's no hope. he shot himself. so, i'm all alone. shall we read from the bible together? no. no, thank you. i've got to let the children know. i'll be in all evening, if there's anything i can do for you. i'll come by sometime this week to make funeral arrangements. i spoke to him, but there was so little i could do. i'm sure you did what you could, sir. it was my parents' dream that i become a clergyman. hello there. those bells rang for 20 seconds too long. unfortunately, i was busy replacing the candles. i usually turn on the bells, light the candles, and make it back in time. but today i bungled it. an unfortunate mishap. but those candles were tricky to light. probably a factory defect. and i guess my broken-down body is slowing down my actions. the reason hardly matters. i leave the temple in semidarkness until just before the bells start. i believe electric lights disturb our spirit of reverence. don't you agree, miss lundberg? you asked to have a word with me. yes, about a rather urgent matter. once, when i complained about my pains keeping me up nights, you suggested that i read... - i remember. to distract myself. i began with the gospels. and real sleeping potions they were too, if i may say so, at least now and then. now i've got as far as the story of christ's passion, and it's given me pause. so i figured i'd discuss it with you, pastor ericsson. i feel compelled to do so. the passion of christ, his suffering. wouldn't you say the focus on his suffering is all wrong? what do you mean? this emphasis on physical pain. it couldn't have been all that bad. it may sound presumptuous of me, but in my humble way, i've suffered as much physical pain as jesus. and his torments were rather brief. lasting some four hours, i gather? i feel he was tormented far worse on another level. maybe i've got it all wrong. but just think of gethsemane, pastor. christ's disciples fell asleep. they hadn't understood the meaning of the last supper or anything. and when the servants of the law appeared, they ran away, and peter denied him. christ had known his disciples for three years. they'd lived together day in and day out, but they never grasped what he meant. they abandoned him, down to the last man. he was left all alone. that must have been painful. to realize that no one understands. to be abandoned when you need someone to rely on. that must be excruciatingly painful. but the worst was yet to come. when jesus was nailed to the cross, and hung there in torment, he cried out, ""god, my god. why hast thou forsaken me?"" he cried out as loud as he could. he thought that his heavenly father had abandoned him. he believed everything he'd ever preached was a lie. in the moments before he died, christ was seized by doubt. surely that must have been his greatest hardship? god's silence. yes. no service today. not a soul turned up. you don't count. you belong, so to speak, in the sheep pen. so, how are you doing? that pastor you're running after isn't worth much. don't deny it. you don't think a spinster can be choosy. mg$?rta, for your own sake, you can leave this place, so get out as quickly as you can. everything at mittsunda and frostng$?s is in the grip of death and decay. take me, for instance. remember when i used to arrange musical soirees on that pile of junk upstairs? i gave concerts. and the things tomas achieved. people actually attended church. but his wife was his undoing. that got your attention, didn't it? the little woman. my old galoshes knew human nature better than tomas did. he only had eyes for her. he was utterly smitten. so much for their love story. ""god is love and love is god. love proves the existence of god. love is a real force for mankind."" you see, i know the drill. i've been an attentive listener to the pastor's outpourings. bye-bye, you old turtledove. get out while you can. hello, you tubercular old wheezer. don't pass your flu on to me. will there be a service? i don't feel well. i can see that. florence nightingale is out there, waiting to minister to your needs. personally, i'd like to get some shut-eye. i'm playing tonight at the masonic lodge, you see. what's your opinion, algot? don't have one. i should have known. i'll go upstairs to the organ. algot can give me a sign when the bells stop ringing. well? there's only miss lundberg out there. guess i shouldn't say ""only."" it's time to start the service bell. that usually brings them in. if only we could feel safe and dare show each other tenderness. if only we had some truth to believe in. if only we could believe. shall we have the service, then? holy, holy, holy is the lord of hosts. the whole earth is full of his glory."
Tarkovsky,Andrei Rublyov,"Pull the rope. - This one? - Arkhip, give me the strap. - Hold it. Take it. Look! It's Yefim , isn't it? - Come here and help. - Pull the rope. - Hold on a second. - Come on, quick! Where is it'? - Where is it'? - Here. Come on, fast. Lift it- Lord. Let it go right. Untie it now. The rope is tangled. Hold it! We won't have enough time. I'm ready! Archipushka! You try to hold them! Just a second. Come on! Hold him, hold him! I'm here. I'm here. Cut the rope, man! Cut the rope! I'll show you, cut the rope! My God! Yefim! - Where are you going? - Archipushka! I'm flying! I'm flying! Hey! Chase me! Chase me! My God! What is it? Archipushka! THE JESTER Summer 1400 Danil ! Danil ! Danil! The Father told you to go back! There is no one to paint the icons. For God's sake! It's no business of yours. You will be sorry for that. You will come begging on your knees. But the Father will not forgive you. Come on. You never know. We shall see. It's not good. What? That we are leaving Troitsa. It's a shame. Aren't there enough painters in Moscow without us, Danil? We'll find some sort of work. All this is right, but it's a pity that... I passed this birch every day and never noticed it. When you know you'll never see it again, it means something. It's been ten years. Nine for you, but ten for me. No, seven for me, nine for you. - It's raining. - Come on here. Let's go. We will not melt. The jesters were walking. Drunk on mead and beer... ...when they met their master, the Boyar... ...and they sang, to greet him: 0 master. 0 Boyar... ...everything is ready in the kitchen! The Boyar's plump wife is a choosy trollop. Mistress, open the door. The master's coming! The Boyar yells: “Jesters are all thieves and drunkards! “You should be whipped from Friday to Friday!“ ""You goats and tramps, drown in your beer! ""Soon you will be impaled!"" The Jesters grabbed him between his navel and his knees. They shaved his beard; what's a Boyar without his beard? Any woman would rather he had a beard. The Boyar yells, hops about like a flea. He scurries home, raps on the window. But his wife doesn't recognize his naked cheeks... ...with no beard to grab hold of. She whacked him with a rolling pin. What a disgrace! “Cover your naked cheeks with your breeches. “Clear off, beardless Boyar!“ He hobbled off, pursued by geese... ...and met a priest... ...who mistook him for a woman and dragged him into the bushes. Without breeches... ...he looks the same at each end. The woman saw a naked head... ...and grabbed it by the beard. May we shelter from the storm? Come in. Do you want some beer? You are soaking wet. Thank you, we don't imbibe. And don't play around with women. God sent priests, but the devil sent jesters. The woman saw a head! By the beard! My woman might have been playing in the bushes. I'll show you! Come here, you. What are you doing? Give it back to him. Where were you, Kirill? Outside. Shall we go? Danil, the rain's stopped; let's go. Christ be with you, mistress. THEOPHANES THE GREEK Summer-Winter-Spring-Summer 1405-1406 I'm innocent! Let me go! Is anyone in here? Have you come to look? Yes, to look. Then look. We'll soon be finished. So you are Theophanes the Greek? Why look at me? Look there. Where are you from? From Andronnikov Monastery. From Andronnikov Monastery? Are you by chance Andrei Rublev? No. I've heard everyone praise this Rublev. He's good, but not as good as this. Such delicate colors. Oh Lord, it's just... Why did you stop praising me? Go on. I can't. I can't find the right words. Konstantin Kostechevsky was right when he said: ""Only with true insight... ""...can you grasp its essence."" Whereas Andrei... and I'll tell him to his face... He's like my brother. He's praised, it's true: he paints well. With subtlety. But there's something lacking in all his work. There's no awe, no faith... ...no faith that comes from the depths of his soul. No simplicity. As Epiphanius said in ""The Life of Saint Sergeius"": ""Simplicity, without gaudiness."" That is what this is. It's sacred. Simplicity, without gaudiness... you can't say it better. I see you are a wise man. If so, is that a good thing? If one is ignorant, isn't it better to be guided by one's heart? In much wisdom there is much grief... ...and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow. Proshka! Where is that oil? Whose ears should I box? It is as though the earth has swallowed everyone. They say you paint quickly. I cannot work any other way. I get bored. I wasted a week on an icon once. You threw it away? No. I used the board to press cabbage. It's all so boring. I have pupils and assistants in abundance... ...but none of them is any good. They can neither read nor write. Listen, help me. Be my assistant. Don't make fun of me. I'm not making fun of you. In spring, I must paint the Church of the Annunciation in Moscow... ...and I have no assistants to do it with. The scaffolding is being built. - Do you understand? - I do understand. But I wouldn't be able to cope. I'll teach you. You never prepared a wall for a fresco? You've a brain; even these idiots can prepare a wall. I said no and I mean no. You know best... ...but mind you don't regret it; I am rancorous. I may regret it, but it's a sin for you. An unknown monk comes to you... ...and you like the fact that you can talk about books with him... ...and you decide to take him and favor him. But I haven't looked at a book for three years and I don't want to. - Why? - I have a different road. Wicked bastards! Where is Proshka? Where is Vikenty? They ran to the square to see how they were going to kill the ruler. Wicked bastards! See? And you don't want to help? - I shall die soon. - You shouldn't say that. The other night I dreamed of an angel. He said: ""Come with me."" I said: ""I shall die soon, without you."" You won't change your mind, will you? Only on one condition. Whatever you want. Money? Half my fee, okay? No. I'll work for nothing if you yourself... ...come to Andronnikov Monastery to fetch me. Before the community, the metropolitan, ask me to help you... ...before the brotherhood, before Andrei Rublev. Then I shall serve you like a slave... ...like a dog, until the day I die. What is your name? Kirill. Orthodox Christians, lovers of truth. How long will this torture go on, when will you end this? You are thoughtless sinners, yet you judge. You faithless heathens! He has already seven times atoned for his sins... ...for both his sins and yours. You are incredible sinners yourselves. And you judge""- ...but you don't have God with you. Rejoice, 0 young man, in thy youth... ...and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth. Walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes... ...but know that for all these... ...God will bring thee into judgment. Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth... ...before the difficult days come... ...and the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say... ...“l have no pleasure in them.“ Remember thy Creator... ...before the silver cord be loosed. Or the golden bowl be broken... ...or the pitcher shattered at the fountain... ...or the wheel broken at the well. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was... ...and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. “Vanity of vanities,“ _ H saith the preacher; “All IS vanity. Kirill, have you seen Father Nikodim? Where has he got to since this morning? He took my gloves, then disappeared as though the earth swallowed him. I have to chop wood and the logs are icy. Why is your candle burning? It's daylight. Did you feed my dog? Did you ask me to? What's the matter with you? Go away. The words of the wise are like goads, and the words of scholars... ...are like well-driven nails, given by one Shepherd. And further, my son, you should stay away from these. Of making many books there is no end... ...-and much study is wearisome to the flesh. Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter... Fear God and keep His commandments... ...for this is man's all. A messenger has come! Who has come? A messenger from Moscow has come. A messenger has come from the Grand Prince. - So? - So so! A messenger from Theophanes the Greek. The Grand Prince orders you to Moscow... ...to paint the Cathedral of the Annunciation, with Theophanes. Is he really Andrei Rublev, this fellow? Yes, he's Rublev... and I'm Kirill. Theophanes the Greek says he wants you in Moscow... ...and he wishes to see you. I thank Theophanes. Tell him... ...that I'll come. I'll come. My head is splitting! Bring my horse here. What is wrong? Choose whichever helpers you like and be ready tomorrow. Is there a blacksmith here? If not, I'll fall off again. There is a smithy outside, beyond the chapel. Farewell, God-fearing people! Semyon! Come here! Come here and help us! Why are you standing? Come here! Let's go today, shall we, Danil? Go quickly, before Theophanes changes his mind. I'm not going. Why aren't you going? How can I manage without you? As best you can. I thought we'd go together. Why did you think for me? I was not invited. I can't do it without you. You can; you agreed to go without asking me. Theophanes simply beckoned. Don't grieve; you're not the first, or the last. Even without you there's plenty of work for me here. Thank God for it. Foma, Aleksei. Let's get ready. Piotr, you're coming with me. Did you forget something, Andrei? I came to say farewell. We've said farewell. I came to say farewell, but... It was hard for me before. Then the devil created enmity between us. I can't go away like this. I must make confession. Will you hear it? I cannot do anything, Danil... ...after living so many years together in the same cell. Apart from you, I have no one. I see the world with your eyes. I hear it with your ears... ...with your heart. lam happy for you, you old fool. If only you knew how happy. Go to Moscow. Paint; I shall be proud of you. The devil tempted me the other day too. Forgive me. I'll come back, Danil. Where are you going? What about Vespers? I'll manage without you. What's wrong with you today, Kirill? I'm tired of lying. I'm going back into the secular world. Why did we leave the Trinity Monastery? Andrei, Danil, you are not saying anything. Because the brothers valued profit higher than faith. They forgot why they had entered a monastery. And now? We sought to praise God with faith and work, but what's happened? The monastery's become a bazaar. Servant of God, how many souls did you trade in for monasticism? Twenty or thirty? And you ran after the Father Superior, bargaining. For two meadows, or even one, you bought eternal salvation. You don't need me to tell you, but you prefer to keep quiet. Perhaps I would also tolerate all this loathsomeness if I had talent. But what talent? Just a slight ability to paint icons. God be praised that He gave me no talent. I'm happy I'm untalented; I can be honest and pure before God. You are taking sin upon your soul! I'll tell you something else, brothers. What do you want to tell us that we don't know already? Do you know what happens to your sort? Speak! I won't get offended! Well, I... Get out, you dog! Out of my sight, you serpent! Rejoin the secular world, slanderer! Now do you see? Kirill! Kirill! It is written: ""And Jesus went into the temple of God... ""...and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple... ""...and overthrew the tables of the money changers... ""...and the seats of them that sold doves. ""And said unto them,"" it is written, ""My house shall be called... ""...the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves."" For three years I was cleaning brushes for Danil... ...before he let me touch an icon. And then only to clean it. Don't you trust me? You're always lying, Foma. Yesterday your robe was sticky; where were you? At the beehive. But you said you were at the monastery. Just look at yourself. Put mud or something on your cheek... ...or you will swell, like a hog. It's too late now, it's useless. You're constantly making up stories. I even think you have a disease. Me? What disease? There is a disease where a man lies without stopping. Look, Foma. Look, I say. What? You think you know everything so I'm not going to teach you any more. Why should I learn? Anyway, I will have to spend three years cleaning the brushes. I'm sick and tired of you, Foma. Go back to the monastery, go wherever you want. I can't understand why I took you as a pupil. You are always like that. First you say one thing then another. You yourself told Theophanes I was perceptive. You were different then; you worked, you didn't lie. And do you know what Theophanes said? ""What does it matter if he's perceptive?"" Whatever Theophanes has said... ...l can see blue colors better than anyone else. You eat too much; how can you paint with a bloated stomach? When your stomach's rumbling, how can your mind work? The rumbling is the only sound you hear. You're lucky, Foma. For you, everything is simple. If you are not painting, you are sleeping or fooling around. But only by prayer can the soul transcend the flesh. Would you go to learn from another teacher instead of me? Why not, if you tell me to go? Come on, come on. Don't be angry. What's that? So you've decided to put the apostle on the left, Andrei. Did you take the glue off the fire? Did you take the glue off the fire? Perceptive is he? He should be beaten every Saturday, like a dog. You're obstinate, Andrei. How did you see so much? Everyone else is thinking only of himself. I saw it, Theophanes. The women of Moscow gave their hair to the Tatars. What else could the poor creatures do? Better to lose their hair than be tortured. Is that heroic? It is. It is true that Russian women are humiliated and unhappy. It's not what I mean. Tell me honestly, are the people ignorant or not? Well, are they? They're ignorant, but whose fault is that? It's their own stupidity. Have you never sinned through ignorance? Everyone has. And I have too. God forgive us and make us better. Well, never mind. The Last Judgment is coming; we'll burn like candles. Mark my words. Each will accuse the other of his own sins, to defend himself. Theophanes, how can you paint with such ideas, even accept praise? I have become a hermit and lived in a cave. I serve God, not man. As regards praise, what is praised today is abused tomorrow. They will forget you, me, everything. All is vanity and ashes. Worse things have been forgotten. Humanity has already committed every stupidity and baseness... ...and now it only repeats them. Everything is an eternal circle and it repeats and repeats itself. If Jesus returned to earth, they would crucify him again. Of course, if only evil is remembered... ...then you will never be happy in the sight of God. Perhaps we must forget some things; but not all. I don't know how to say it. Then be quiet and listen to me. You think that one can only do good alone? Good. Remember the New Testament. Jesus taught people in the temples... ...so why did they gather later? To kill him! ""Crucify him!"" they shouted. And the disciples? Judas sold Him. Peter denied Him. They all ran away, yet they were the best. But they repented. That was afterwards, when it was too late. It's never too late to repent. Of course, people do evil. But you can not blame them altogether. It's difficult... ...and sinful, I think. Judas sold the Christ, and remember who bought him. People. And who accused Jesus? The scribes and Pharisees... ...they could not find witnesses, however hard they tried. “Who will testify against this innocent?“ Only later on they found the traitors. Two were found immediately. Two, and not one. There were only two. The Pharisees were masters of deceit, educated. They had studied to gain power... ...lo take advantage of the people's ignorance. We must remind people more often that they are people. Russians, of the same blood, of the same land. Evil is everywhere. Someone will always sell you for thirty pieces of silver. New misfortunes constantly befall the peasant... ...either Tatars three times an autumn, or famine, or plague... ...and he still keeps on working, working, working... ...meekly bearing his cross. He does not despair, he is silent and patient. He only prays to God for enough strength. How could God not forgive him his ignorance? You know yourself. You're tired and discouraged... ...and suddenly... ...in the crowd you meet a human glance... ...-and everything's lighter, as it is after Communion. Isn't it so? You just spoke of Jesus. Perhaps He was born and crucified to reconcile God and man. Jesus came from God, so He is all-powerful. And if He died on the cross, it was predetermined... ...-and His crucifixion and death were God's will. That would have aroused hatred not in those who crucified Him... ...but in those who loved Him... ...if they had been near Him at that moment... ...because they loved Him as a man only. But if He, of His own will, left them... ...He displayed injustice, or even cruelty. Maybe those who crucified Him loved Him... ...because they helped in this divine plan. Do you understand what you are saying? They'll exile you to the north, man, to renovate the icons. Am I not right? You too always say what you think. But I'm not a monk; I'm free. THE HOLIDAY Spring 1408 Sergei, over here! Light the fire. Foma, let's get some logs. Piotr has probably never seen... ...either Assumption Cathedral or Saint Dmitry Cathedral. Never mind, he will begin working, and understand things. Foma! Where are you? We won't be on time. It's okay, we'll be there tomorrow. No. We'll never finish the Cathedral of the Assumption by winter. It's almost June, Andrei. What is it? Quiet! Do you hear it? Nightingales? Nothing else? Come on. - What is it? - Come on. They're practicing witchcraft. Where are you going? Come to me. Hold on. Come to me. Darling. Take your hand away. There is an anthill. Anthill? Anthill. - Who is this? - I don't know. Let's go. It seemed to me... ...as if a black snake was hiding himself. What are you doing? Let me go! We'll let you go. At dawn, we'll hang a stone around your neck, to help you swim. Heaven's fire will consume you! The Last Judgment awaits! Now we'll tie you to this cross... ...like Jesus Christ. What are you doing, men? You can't do this to me. This is a sin. At least hang me upside-down. Men, brothers! Leave him here for the night, unless he ascends again. He's not going anywhere. - And who is this? - Marfa. Why did you want to be head down? It would have been worse. Why did you threaten us with fire from heaven? It is a sin to go naked and do what you do. What sin? Tonight is for lovemaking; is love a sin? Is it love to tie a man up like this? You might call the monks... ...who would force us to accept your faith. Do you think it's easy to live in fear? You live in fear because you know no love but bestial love. Carnality without soul; but love should be brotherly. Isn't all love the same? It's just love. What are you doing? Untie me. Why are you looking at me? Where were you? Thank God. Are these the people? No, these are strangers. Don't you see it? There is some onion, if you want it. Where were you? These forests are impenetrable; I'm all scratched. The local people like it. They are accustomed to it. For people, everything is a matter of custom. Old people don't need to think... ...for their days pass according to custom. But perhaps they consciously enjoy the way the days drag on. - Couldn't you get here before? - No. I couldn't. That is your sin, your conscience, your prayers. Get him, and her! Why are they doing that? Because the accursed pagans don't believe in one God. Don't look, Sergei. There is nothing to look at. Let me go! - Let me go! - You can't see that! Kick him so he shuts up! Go, go! Don't dawdle! Help, Fyodor! Help! Fyodor! Can't you deal with a woman? Stop! Hold her! Marfa, run! Catch her! - Where are you going? - She will drown herself! Marfa! Run, Marfa! Swim, Marfa! THE LAST JUDGMENT Summer 1408 Come here! He's just wasting materials. Who needs it? Foma! - What do you want? - Can I go for a swim? - No, you can't. - It's hot! Don't be lying. It's not. Maybe he's really hot. I'm hot too. Of course, you are working and he is sitting. Let him go swim. Don't spoil him. Let him be sitting with everyone. You shut up! You sleep all day long like a log... ...and you come down only to eat and go to the bathroom. And have you found a job for me? - You have found what you wanted. - So what? Since everyone is sitting here, let Serezhka be sitting with us too. If you had let him go, he would have been back already. Give him freedom... ...and he will sit in the water until he turns blue. He only thinks that it's hot... - ...and that's why he is whining. - He's not whining, you are. It was me. I was the first to say it's hot, and not Sergei. Why are you picking on Sergei? That's it! You want to go swimming, go! Go! Why are you sitting? Goa Here! You see? Wait! Wait! Where's Andrei? Not here? This is a fine state of affairs. I was at our bishop's house just now. Such a fuss. Yelling! He was purple with rage. ""I've lost patience!"" he cried. He meant you. All of you. ""For two whole months,"" he said, ""everything has been ready. ""But they haven't started yet. ""Nothing is ready; they asked for so much money, but do nothing. ""None of them is working and nothing is ready."" Did you ask for a lot of money? How do I know? He said, ""I don't care. Danil Chorny or Andrei Rublev... ""...it's all the same to me."" ""It's all the same."" And he pulled a face like this. ""What do I care about Andrei Rublev? ""By autumn,"" he says... ""...I want the cathedral painted, and that's that!"" He's sent a courier with a complaint to the Grand Prince. He's sent a courier to the Grand Prince. It's a complaint about you, you know. You haven't started yet. You'd better hurry up. Where's Andrei? He's gone somewhere again. Can't you start without him? Go on, start without him. Why are you smirking? There are so many of you. If he can't make his mind up, can't one of you? Two heads are better than one. Where is Andrei? I can't go on like that. Answer me: yes or no? Yes or no? Wasn't everything decided in Moscow? To the smallest detail; the Prince said everything was in order. What is not clear? What have we been discussing for two months? Explain it to me. I may be old, I may have lost my wits. The Last Judgment; either you accept the task and paint it... ...or you refuse the commission. And if we really refused? If we went back, Danil? How shall I face people? I should die of shame. We're wasting such good time. This heat, no rain. We could have finished the cupola and the columns. How wonderfully they could have been done... ...how brightly, and beautifully. On the right, the sinners... ...boiling in pitch, painted to make your flesh crawl. I have thought of a great devil, with smoke from his nose and eyes. - It's not the smoke that matters. - Then what matters? I don't know. - Why aren't you looking at me? - Because I can't. I can't paint all that; it disgusts me. I don't want to terrify people. Understand me, Danil. Collect yourself! Listen! It's the Last Judgment! I didn't invent it. I can't do it. Do as you will, but I can't. Why didn't you speak earlier, in Moscow? You shouldn't have agreed. This is dishonest. I am what I am. You couldn't teach me integrity. I don't know what to paint. What do you mean, you don't know? We were ordered to paint the Last Judgment. You see... ...I think it will be better... ...if we don't paint the Last Judgment at all. What do you mean? You know. I want... I don't want anything. - Nothing. - That's it. Well, I'm leaving. This is no work for me. Thanks for your kindness and your slaps; I learned something. But now I'm going to work for myself. They've asked me to paint a church at Pafnutievo. Not a great honor, but it's still an honor. I'm going to paint the Last Judgment. Who will come with me? Well, then, stay... ...but don't complain later. When I was a child... ...l spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child... ...but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see through a glass, darkly... ...but then face to face... ...now I know in part... ...but then shall I know... ...even as also I am known. And now abideth... ...faith, hope, and charity... ...but the greatest of these is charity. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels... ...and have not charity... ...I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy... ...and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge... ...and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains... ...and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor... ...and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity... ...it profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not... ...charily vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up... ...doth not behave itself unseemly... ...seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil... ...rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth... ...beareth all things... ...believeth all things, hopelh all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth ...but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail... ...whether there be tongues, they shall cease... ...whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part... Princess, is that nice? It's sinful to splash milk. Such a naughtiness. - Why is it sinful? - Because... wipe it off. But it will dry by itself in a minute. Let's walk by the stream. Let me go, Stepan, or I'll send you to the stables. How do you like it? I couldn't imagine it better. It's light, beautiful. It's light. Take her out. Her nurses have spoiled her. I say! No one can build a mansion better than us. Who could paint like that? Look at the carving. Only Mitiai can do this directly, without tracing. It's like a bird singing. Look. Maybe it is like a bird singing. I don't care. I can sleep on the hay. You are the Grand Prince. Don't you like it? I'll tell you this. It should be repainted. Walls, ceiling, everything: brighter, stronger colors. I've been in this trade for forty years. It's not the years that matter... ...but your ability to glorify the Grand Prince with your work. That's enough. Go. We won't redo anything. It's time to go. We have another job. They are waiting for us in Zvenigorod. Where? At your brother's. They have the stone already. A beautiful stone. Whiter than this. When your brother came at Easter... ...we made a deal and he said: ""Do what you like, whatever the cost. ""I'll tax the peasants more, just build me the best mansion possible."" Then go to Zvenigorod. Here, I have brought it. When I looked at the Prince, he became numb. - When I mentioned Zvenigorod? - Yes, he became paralyzed. He fears his brother will outshine him. - Who carved that? - I did. Why didn't you set it in the wall? It didn't come out right. Pity; it's rather good. Everything crumbles: I told the Prince to spare no expense on the stone. Maybe now he's sorry when he heard about Zvenigorod. I could have carved beautiful things for him. Come on, you ass! Where's Stepan? Where did Stepan gallop to? He went to Zvenigorod with the others. I've dirtied my hands. We'll build another mansion just as good for the Prince's brother. Will the stone be better there? Yes, it will. Look, the Captain of the Guard. Hold on, old man. You, ass! Help him! In the bushes! Where's my whip? Has anyone seen my whip? Damn. I've lost it. Have you seen my whip, ass? - Seryoga. - What? Read the Scriptures. From where? From wherever you like. ""Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ. ""Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things... ""...and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you. ""But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ... ""...and the head of the woman is the man... ""...and the head of Christ is God. ""Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered... ""...dishonoreth his head. But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth... ""...with her head uncovered, dishonoreth her head... ""...for that is even all one as if she were shaven. ""For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn... ""...but if it be shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven... ""...let her be covered. ""For a man ought not to cover his head... ""...forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God... ""...but the woman is the glory of the man. ""For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. ""Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. ""For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head... ""...because of the angels. ""Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman... ""...neither the woman without the man, in the Lord."" Go on reading. ""For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man... ""...also by the woman; but all things of God. ""Judge in yourselves: is it comely... ""...that a woman pray unto God uncovered? ""Doth not even nature itself teach you that, if a man have long hair... ""...it is a shame unto him? ""But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her... ""...for her hair is given her for..."" Why have you stopped? Read. “But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory for her... “But if any man seem to be contentious... “But if any man seem to be contentious... “...we have no such custom... ”...neither the Churches of God. “Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not... “...that ye come together not for the better... ”...but for the worse.” Danil, listen. It's a feast. It's a feast, Danil, and you are saying... They are not sinners... She is not a sinner, even if she does not wear a scarf. She is not a sinner. Leave him alone. Let God's servant repent. The Passion According to Andrei Part Two THE RAID Autumn of 1408 They are coming! The Tatars are coming, Prince! Hey, Prince! Is this your ford? It has been raining, and everything is flooded. Follow us. We were just going to leave. We expected you yesterday. I couldn't resist attacking a small town on my way. I am sorry I am late. Never mind. Let's go. It will be shallow to the left. Keep to the left. This isn't a trap? Believe me, Vladimir is deserted. My brother, the Grand Prince, is in Lithuania. Here is the town, behind that forest. They say the Prince has a son, but you want the throne. We'll see. I see you want the throne. I understand. You were told to keep left. Grab this! Come on, Prince! Don't lag behind! Strong is your love for your brother. This is our destiny. When were you last reconciled with him? I never was. The Metropolitan summoned us... ...and made us kiss the cross and swear to live in harmony. What are you saying? The Metropolitan summoned us to kiss the cross. - When ? - Last winter. Vladimir is a beautiful town. Do you like it? Let's go. Forward! You dog, stay close, or I'll kill you! Keep close to the Prince! To the gates! Tatars! Run away! What is going on? The Grand Prince is coming. The brother has arrived. Hold him, hold him! Brothers, what are you doing? We are all fellow Russians. I'll show you if we are fellow Russians, you Vladimir swine! Catch him! Catch him! Run around! Don't you hear me? Where the devil are we? There's no one here. They've all fled. How your bitch has grown; doesn't remember me, eh? Vaska, take the dog. Oh please, let me go! Don't be afraid, beautiful. I'll show you how Tatars can love. Well, Prince? Aren't you sorry about the cathedral? Tell me, Prince, who is that woman? It's no woman, it's the Virgin Mary: the Nativity. Who is in the box? Christ, her son. How can she be a virgin if she has a son? Strange things happen in Russia! Very interesting. Tie his legs tighter! Tell the truth, you dog! Hold on, hold on! I haven't seen your gold. By God, by God, I haven't seen it! It hurts! I don't know where the gold is; it probably was stolen. Your Tatars must have taken it. You're all thieves. Ask around your own men. He hasn't told the truth. Come here, I'll tell you something. See how the devils torture an innocent Russian believer. Look, you Judas, you dirty Tatar! You lie, I'm Russian. I recognize you. You resemble your brother. You've sold Russia! I recognized you! Mark my words! ""No Tatar shall ever set foot on Russian soil."" This is my vow to the Lord. Give me a cross. Let a believer kiss the cross. You'll get your cross. If I have sinned, may God forgive me. God is merciful. Lord, will you pardon me? But all of you will boil in pitch. You will leave and we will rebuild again... ...but your guts will go to the fires of hell. What are you doing this for? Theophanes? But you are dead. I wanted to see you so much. Even if you had not wanted, I would have come anyway. I dreamed you were suspended in a window with your head down. You look in, and wag your finger at me... ...and I'm lying across a saddle... ...and two Tatars twist my head. And you look at me, and tap on the window. And I cry out to you. What do you cry? What's happening to us? We are being murdered and raped. Together with Tatars, they are pillaging churches. And you said to me... Only now I'm worse off than you. You're dead, but I... Dead? What of it? I didn't mean that. I've spent half my life in blindness. I worked for people day and night. But they aren't people, are they? What you said was true. So what if I said it then? You are wrong now, I was wrong then. But haven't we the same faith... ...the same land... ...the same blood? One Tatar even smiled. Like this! And shouted: ""Even without us you'll out each other's throats!"" What a disgrace. They killed everyone. Even my Seryoga. I found him on such a special day. She is the only one that survived. It's time for me to go. Wait. Don't go. Don't you like being with me; are you bored? All right, I won't... Let's sit and talk. I'll tell you... But I already know everything. Then you know I'll never paint again. Why so? Because it's of no use to anyone. That's all. So what? Your iconostasis was burned. Do you know how many of mine they burned? In Pskov, Novgorod... You are committing a grave sin. I haven't told you the worst. I killed a man. A fellow Russian. When I saw him carrying her off. Look at her. Just look at her! I don't remember how it happened. I caught up with him... ...and I couldn't help it. Through our sins, evil has assumed human form. Encroaching evil means encroaching humanity. God will forgive you; don't forgive yourself. Live, between divine forgiveness and your own torment. As for your sins, what do your scriptures say? ""Learn to do good: seek justice... ""...rebuke the oppressor, defend the fatherless, plead for the widow. ""Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord... ""...though your sins be as scarlet... ""...they shall be as white as snow."" See, I haven't forgotten; that may comfort you. I know, God is merciful and will pardon me. I shall offer the Lord a vow of silence. I have nothing more to say to people. Is this a good idea? I have no right to advise you. Didn't you go to heaven? Lord! I can only say it is not as you imagine it on earth. Russia, Russia! Our mother country suffers all; she will endure all. But how long will this go on? I don't know. Forever, most likely. Yet how beautiful all this is. It's snowing. Nothing is more terrible than snow falling in a temple. THE CHARITY Winter 1412 The apples are all rotten. In all my years, I've never seen such a famine. We are slowly dying out. Lord have pity on us. Mefody is bringing someone again. Mefody, you should not be the gate-keeper... ...because you will let the whole neighborhood in here to eat. - Sit down, man of God. - Thank you. To eat! You can't feed all the hungry people. There is no one in the neighborhood. The villages are deserted. Everyone has left Khotkovo. The people of Semyonovka have fled. They've fled, they've fled! It's true. I passed Semyonovka this morning. In Vladimir it is even worse. No harvest for three years; everyone has fled. Those who stayed are eating mice. Why are you whispering? I'm not whispering. I have a cold. I spent a night in a lake. Why was that? Wolves chased me; I fled to the lake, praying they wouldn't follow. I was standing like that till dawn. When I got out, I was completely numb. I've been sick for two weeks and I'm shivering all over. - So you're from Vladimir. - I used to live there. Someone else from Vladimir is here. Andrei Rublev. Have you heard of him? He has sinned, and now he is atoning. He has brought a holy fool with him from Vladimir. A mute girl. Now they are silent together. Though she is a holy fool, she knows where to get better food. He has brought her... ...so that he may always remember his sin. Can you call it holiness? And Rublev's guild? It fell apart. Some were killed by Tatars... ...others were driven away. Is Danil alive? Some say he went north, others say he died. So he's given up his craft? Aren't you Kirill? Kirill, is it you? Father! Master! Kirill has come back! Father! Let your prodigal son Kirill back in! You didn't ask me if you could leave... ...and now you want to come back? You didn't like it in the secular world? No, I won't take you in. My God, why hast thou forsaken me? Now you want back into the den of thieves... ...to the money-changers and dove-sellers. You think because I am old, I have forgotten about it. Begone! Go back to where you came from! There is no place for you here! Don't drive me away, for God's sake! There is no truth in the world. The devil tempted me. I can't continue sinning... ...and without sin you cannot live in the secular world. There is sin and dirt all around. Accept my penitence and I will kiss your feet. You were always eloquent, but you won't move me, Kirill. If you knew how I've suffered, what I've endured... ...if you knew what evil I've seen, you would forgive me... ...but I will never forgive myself. You're not guilty before me, but before God. Remain here; but to expiate your sin... ...you must copy out the Scriptures fifteen times. Take the late Nikodim's cell. Thank you! Thank you, God! How wonderful! Thank you, Father, thank you! Hey, it's bad to eat dirty meat. Brothers, what's going on? I'll go to tell Father Nikodim. A good Russian. She eats horsemeat. Do you want to come with me? You'll be my wife. I have seven wives, but no Russian wife. You will eat horsemeat every day, drink horse milk, wear coins in hair. Russian wife for Tatar husband is never dirty. Girl! Come with us! Come! Give me your hand! Do you hear me, Andrei? Don't you recognize me? Don't grieve, they'll let her go. They won't dare harm a holy fool. It's a sin. THE BELL Spring-Summer-Autumn- Winter-Spring 1423-1424 Is this the home of Nikolka, the bell-maker? It is. - Is he your father? - Yes. Then call him. - He's not here. - Where is he? He's dead. The plague took them all: mother, sister, father. And where does Gavrila the bell-maker live? Gavrila? He's dead, too. So is Kasian, and the Tatars led lvashka away last year. Only Fyodor is left. Go to him; the fifth hut. But you should hurry; Fyodor's in bed with the plague. He can't open his eyes. He will pass away at any moment. I can't stand it any more. Where else can we look? Let's go home. Get up. You aren't going home. Is there no one left to cast the bell? Take me with you. Let me cast the bell for you. Are you mad, boy? Take me to the Prince. Honestly, I can make everything very well for you. You won't find anyone better than me; they're all dead. Go to hell! Okay! But I know the secret of bell-making, and I won't tell. What are you saying? I know the secret. My father knew the secret of bell-making. Before he died, he passed it to me. No one else knows, except me. My father died and passed me the secret. Shall we take him? What secret? Do you want the Prince to flay us? He's lying about the secret. The worse for him! - What is your name? - Boriska. Come here! Mount! What about the hut? Did you persuade him? Shall we dig here? We can do it here. But it would be more convenient to do it closer to the bell-tower... ...so that we won't have to drag this heavy thing far. Can't we dig here? Let's do it here. Mark it out. Let's dig together, shall we? We're bell-casters, not diggers. Why should we be digging? You know what my father said... ...before he died? ""Bell-casters must dig the casting-pit."" ""I only understood that in my old age,"" he said, and died. I don't know what Nikolka said, but I'm not going to dig. Call us when you need us. Okay, I'll dig for you. Well? Did you find it? There is no need to look for it. Here it is. No, it's not the right clay. - We always took it here. - Then you are fools. The clay is very good. - Andreika, isn't the clay bad? - Yes, it's bad. You see? Come on. We'll search until we find good clay. Stepan, perhaps we shouldn't have done this. Come on. Look what clay we have found. How hard we've worked, and now we've found a new spot. It's not the right kind. It's the end of August, and we have not found the clay yet. Think about yourself. I'm sorry for you. I've managed all these years without your pity. Let's go back, Boriska. I can't. I know that's not the right clay. Then what is right? I know what it is. I don't need people like you. I can manage without you. I don't need such people! Andreika! Semyon: I have found it! Uncle Fyodor! I've found it! The clay! Uncle Seymon! Stepan! We've found the good clay, Stepan! Here is the clay! I have found the clay, Stepan! Andreika! Andreika! Where are you all? Boriska! Boriska! - What? - Shall I dig in? I'm coming. What are you saying? LN \ \ N] I “Q 3 Where's Nikolai? He left this morning to fetch wood. - It should be here already. - He'll be back by evening. The evening? I need to reinforce it now. To the devil with your Nikolai, he's an idiot. Why are you standing there? Work! - The merchants don't agree. - What do you mean? They have tripled the price. They say it's still cheap. Buy it. What else can we do? Buy it at this price? Buy, I say! The Prince will flay you. We'll ruin him. I no longer care. Buy it. You're in the way, Father. It's dangerous. Don't dig in without me. - Boriska! - Just one moment. The cast won't hold; it needs another layer. Another layer? You should have applied the clay already. You haven't put up the frame yet! It needs reinforcing, but there are no more twigs. We're not going to reinforce it. We start firing tonight. Is he kidding? If we don't reinforce the cast, it won't hold. It will crack and our work will be wasted. If it snows and we can't fire, won't our work be wasted, too? They'll flog me, not you. The cast won't hold like this. Apply the clay. Do you hear me? I won't do it. You won't? Then get out! Andreika, apply the clay. He won't do it, either. Are you going to apply the clay? The metal will burst the mold. It needs reinforcement. Will you obey me? Who is in charge here? It needs reinforcement. Flog him! He refuses to work. He won't obey my orders. I'll show you who's in charge! Your father treated us better. You remember him? Then flog him in my father's name. All right, apply the Clay- Start the work without me. But we're waiting for you. Start without me. Rest, sleep a little. Why are you staring at me? Lost your tongue? Are you deaf? Are you sorry for him? Go and console him; that's what a monk is for. 0 Lord. 0 Queen of Heaven... I can't understand how the Grand Prince trusted him with all this. Boriska! Wake up! I've started the firing. Why did you start without me? I told you to wake me. Only I know when to start. Fyodor, the Prince's men have come, and they want to see you. What heat! What heat! That's enough. Not enough silver; tell the Prince not to be so miserly. Our Grand Prince is never miserly. I don't care. I need another eighteen pounds of silver. What's eighteen pounds of silver, more or less? Who knows the secret of bell-casting, I or you? Tell the Prince not to be miserly. We need another sixteen pounds. Are you mad? I'll get all the silver I want from the Prince. Imagine, if after this it doesn't ring! Watch out. I recognize him! Beat him! Beat him! Are you mad? To attack someone like that. You've mistaken him for another. I'm not mistaken. I recognize you, Judas. How handsome he used to be then. Now he has lost his looks. Thanks to him, I spent ten years in prison... ...and they cut off half my tongue. I'll kill him! I'll kill him! I'll kill him! He's innocent, brother. He's betrayed no one. I swear it by the Holy Cross. Lord, why this punishment? Strike me, but don't touch him. Get up. You're heavy. The Prince's jester died. They wanted me to go, but I'd rather be a carpenter. I recognize him. He denounced me. Give me something to drink. There are worse things than that. Andreika, stand aside. Why stand there? Work! Add some more, add some more! Come on! Boriska, where is he? Boriska, where is he? Boriska, the second furnace is ready. Go, go! We're all ready. Open! Everything is ready. Shall we begin? Come on! It's coming, Boriska! It's coming! It's coming. It's coming, Boriska! It's coming! It's coming. God, help me. What a day tomorrow will be! We should get some sleep. Boriska! Let's go, shall we? Just a moment. This is what happened, Andrei. I've thought it over and I've decided to tell you. You know how much I envied. Envy just gnawed at me. It was inside me like a poison. I couldn't stand it any longer, that's why I left. I left because of you. When I heard you had given up painting, the envy went. My heart grew lighter. Then I forgot. I only want to copy the Scriptures before I die. The Father Superior is strict... ...and his punishment is not easy in my old age. I'm afraid I won't have enough time to finish my task. Why am I repenting? Why should I repent to you? You yourself are a greater sinner than I. Yes, yes, greater than I. What am I? A humble worm; nothing is demanded of me. But you, what are you? For what sacred deed did God give you your talent? For what did you deserve it? Lord, I don't want to say this. I know Nikon has sent a third messenger to you... ...to persuade you to come back to paint the Trinity. And you sent them all back. You wouldn't even talk to them. I'll tell you the truth. I won't lie. Then, in my dirty soul, there, in the very depth of it... ...there was a tiny flicker of joy. And now... ...my life is ending; my soul calls out for rest. Nikon doesn't care a bit for your life. He wants you here, to glorify and strengthen his power with your talent. Never mind Nikon, but listen to me. Go to the Trinity Cathedral and paint, paint, paint! Don't burden your soul, for it is an awful sin to deny the divine spark. If Theophanes were alive, wouldn't he say the same thing? Look at me, look at the ungifted one. Why do you think I returned? For a crust of bread, to finish my life in peace. I shall die soon and nothing will remain after me. And I know that I will die soon. Nor have you much longer to live. Do you want to take your talent to the grave? Why are you silent, Andrei? Give me at least one word. It was I who denounced that jester then. Curse me, but don't stay silent, Andrei. Curse me. Well, how is it? Come on, then. Everyone, get away! What's going on up there? Everything is okay. Come on, come on! Everyone go up! Is everyone ready? Well? Come on. Go on. Give the signal. Come on! The Grand Prince is coming with a foreign ambassador. Is everything ready? If not, watch out! Motherfucker! We bless and consecrate this bell with holy water. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Amen. Look what kind of people are overseeing here. Where are you going? Isn't it rather peculiar? They're all peculiar here. Come on, come on, dumbbell! Shall I help you, or will you touch it yourself? What do you think will come out of all this travesty? What do you think? In my opinion, nothing good will come out of this. Excuse me, Your Excellency, but I think you are being deceived by appearances. Look at all of this! What do you think of this dumb bell, this awkward scaffold? Iwould sum it up and say this bell will not ring. In fact, it can't ring. Does Your Excellency wish to make a wager? I think you underestimate the situation these people are in. Besides, they were the ones that built it. That may be true, but I wouldn't venture to call that thing a bell. Excellency, they fully understand... ...that the Prince will behead them if it doesn't ring. Judging from the face of that youth... ...one could say that he is aware of the circumstances. Don't you think so? Excellency... ...have you heard that the Grand Prince beheaded his brother? It seems they were twins. Look at that marvelous girl! My God! My friend, that girl is not more than thirteen years old. That doesn't make her less attractive. Sometimes these girls are women at the age of thirteen. What's the matter with you, Your Excellency? Come on, come on. My father, that old snake, didn't pass on the secret. He died without telling me, he took it to the grave. Skinflint scoundrel! You see, it's turned out very well. Come on, come on. Let's go together, you and I. You'll cast bells. I'll paint icons. We'll go to the Trinity Monastery together. What a feast day for the people. You've brought them such joy, and you're crying. Come on, come on."
Tarkovsky,Ivan's Childhood,"Comrade Lieutenant! What is it? They've detained someone. The lieutenant said to bring him to you. Light the lamp. He was crouching in the river near the bank. He won't say why. He won't answer any questions. He says he'll only talk to the commander. He's very weak, or else pretending. The second lieutenant gave the order. Go stand by the stove. Who are you? First send him out. Wait outside. I'll call you. Well? Say something. Where are you from? I am Bondarev. Tell No. 51 at HQ that I'm here. Who's No. 51? What HQ do you mean? What army? Field post VCH-49550. Strip down and dry yourself off. Go on, take it. It's dirty anyway. The pants too. What are you... bashful? What's that on your back? I asked what's on your back! None of your business. And don't shout at me. Just tell HQ I'm here. They'll know what to do. Don't order me around! You know where you are? I've never heard of you. You'll stay here till you tell me who you are and where you're from. Got that? Are you gonna answer? Answer if you want me to report that you're here. - The other side of the river. - What? How did you get here? Can you prove it? I don't have to prove anything! And stop questioning me or you'll answer for it! Just tell No. 51 at HQ that Bondarev's here, and that's it! They'll know what to do. Very well. Give me No. 3. No. 3? Comrade Captain, No. 8 here. I have Bondarev here. - Who? He demands that I notify Volga. Major Bondarev from Operations? The inspector? This is no major. It's a kid of about 12. Who are you putting on here? You been drinking? I just thought... He says he's from the other side of the river. ""He says""? I suppose he came over on a flying carpet! Tell him if he doesn't notify No. 51, he'll be held responsible. Well, you asked me to report and I did. He told me to lock you up. Satisfied now? I said to tell No. 51. Who did you call? I can't just call Army HQ. - Then let me. - Don't you dare. Who are you gonna call? Who do you know at Army HQ? Captain Kholin... and Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov. Tell Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov I'm here at once. Or I'll call myself. Baikal? Get me No. 51 at Volga. No. 51? Senior Lieutenant Galtsev reporting. Bondarev is here. He insists... Bondarev? Alone? Listen carefully, Galtsev. No questions and no discussion. Kholin's coming for him immediately. In the meantime, make him comfortable and be gentle with him. The kid has a hot temper. First of all, give him paper and pencil. Send whatever he writes to me at once. Got that? - Yes, sir. Are you going to eat? Later. I won't look. Get me No. 13. Vasilyev, bring in two pails of hot water. What? That's right. I'm going to wash up. Enough of your talk. Big hero! If you'd had a toothache like the one I had... Some tour of duty! Enough talk now. I'm going down to the river to see what's going on. You stay here. Hurry up. Wash up. I'll be back soon. Thanks. It's deep. Of course it is. In a very deep well, you can see a star even on the brightest day. What star? Any star. - Mama, I see it! - Yes, there it is. Why's it there? It's nighttime now for the star, so it came out just like it was night. But is it nighttime now? It's daytime. It's daytime for you and me, but it's nighttime for the star. You needn't get so worked up over the smallest thing. Stop this stupid talk. Well, I'm going down to the river to see what's going on. You stay here. All right, but... Aren't they here yet? No. Go to sleep. I'll wake you up when they're here. Were you here while I was sleeping? Yes. Why? Did I talk in my sleep? No. Why? Never mind. I never used to talk in my sleep. Now I don't know. My nerves are on edge. Ivan! Kholin! How can this be? Katasonych is waiting for you at the hollow tree! The Germans are there. I got a cramp halfway across. I thought I was done for. - You swam across? - Don't be mad. They're patrolling the bank. Think it's easy finding our dinghy in the dark? They catch you and you're finished. Kholin! You're nothing but skin and bones. Bring the car closer. Hello. Tell the sentry not to let anyone in. Here, get dressed. Keep coming. That's good. Where'd you disappear to? Where are you going? - For kerosene. What for? We're leaving. Here's to meeting again. Katasonych is waiting for me at the hollow tree. Here's to his safe return. No. 20 here. No. 51 here. Listen, Malyshev, about that disagreement... they were right. We should head for Fyodorovka. - But we decided... Yes, I've heard all this before. May I, Lieutenant Colonel? What? Hello? I've heard it all before. I have reliable firsthand information. Waited all night for nothing, eh, Katasonych? Sit down. Ivan's here. He couldn't make it to the hollow tree on the bank. Says there were German patrols everywhere. How did he get here? He swam across. But that's... A grown man might drown. Well, that's enough about that. Ivan, wait! What's all this about? He says I'm to be sent to the rear! You're sending me to military school? Is that true? So that's how you work, by tricking me? I know the offensive is coming. I can still be useful. You said reconnaissance is the most important part, that scouts are the soul of the front. So now it's come to this? I won't go. If you force me, I'll run away and join the partisans. You're going to military school. You got that? The matter is closed! I'll discuss it no further! Well, I will! Kholin, tell him I'll do a good job. I'll work hard! I can't just... Katasonych, you tell him. The matter is closed! Very well. Military school or a children's home... it's all the same to me. Quiet. Yesterday in the mail I received two mysterious letters Each line was nothing but periods For me to figure out on my own The stove and chimney will stand forever. Where is it? I put it right here. Are you going far? Yes. Everybody is nowadays. But why? Who knows? I lost a nail. Help me find it. You're not doing anything. Come in. No stove or chimney will ever burn down. Here's a straight nail. No, not that one. Where's your mama? Is she alive? A German shot my old lady too. Where can it be? I just had it. A tall fellow... with glasses. And hair down to here. What's your name? Ivan. Pelageya will be back soon. That was my old lady's name. I'll have the house all ready for her. How could you, Ivan? Think I've got all day to chase after you in the mud? No one asked you to. Watch your mouth! So he was off to join the partisans. Get in the car. You won't run away again. Yes, I will. I said get in the car! I'll run away from your military school, just like I did from the children's home. ""I ran away from Granny, and from Granddad too."" O Lord, when will all this end? Can't you understand, silly? War isn't for you. Understand? But you promised not to order... Lakhov and Moroz were killed because they were big. I can get through anywhere. Besides, I'm all alone. I have no one left. That's enough. It's been decided. Nothing's been decided! Are you my father, that you can decide for me? Shut up! Or I'll give you a good whipping. Anyway, I'll run away if you don't let me go. I'm my own boss. His own boss. You're a real problem. Are you aware that there are lice in Company 5? The linen isn't disinfected properly. Please do something about it. Yes, Lieutenant. We simply can't have this. There'll be no time for that when the offensive begins. Yes, Lieutenant. Thank you. - A letter from home? - Yes. Everything all right? Yes. Greetings! I've been looking all over for you... Carry on. I'll wait. You must be stricter with your subordinates. You try to do everything yourself. There's a lull now, and we have time. When the offensive starts, there'll be the wounded. I honestly don't know what to do with you. Get the medical service in order. Report back to me in two days. Yes, sir. Don't worry. Everything will be in order. What's your name, Lieutenant? Masha. Pretty name. My name's Leonid. Lennie for short. Have you ever... - What? Known a guy named Lennie? No. So I'm the first? Are you from the Ukraine? - Why do you ask? You're beautiful and stubborn. No, I'm from near Moscow. Twenty minutes by train. In Siberia we consider 200 miles ""nearby"". Surikov, the artist, was from our city. Ever heard of him? Writers lived near our town. We once saw Alexei Tolstoy walking in the woods. Very tall, with gray hair. We were walking through the woods. Have you ever been wounded? - Yes. Why are we being so formal? Let's relax a bit. - I can't so easily. - I can. I'll start, and you catch up, okay? What is it? - A cobweb. You scared? What a brave soldier. Some soldier you are. I'm only afraid of spiders. Nothing else? Vasilyev, have you seen Captain Kholin anywhere? He went that way, Lieutenant, with the medical assistant. Climb up this trunk. You said you weren't afraid of anything. All right. That's far enough. Jump. I'll catch you. Are you scared? Then why don't you do it? - No special reason. Did you get scared? Fine. I forgive you. I don't need your forgiveness. You don't? - Let me help you. - I'll manage. ""I'll manage!"" Masha... come here. What for? Come closer, Masha. What for? Quick, come here. Hurry. Now go away. Go away. You hear me? Go. Hurry and go now, Masha. Let's go have a look at your troops. Lakhov and Moroz are up there. Go have a smoke. - Greetings, sir. - Hello, Katasonych. Give me the defense line map, Galtsev. Go wait for me in your trench. I'll be right there. Comrade Lieutenant... some gunners gave me a record. They said you had a phonograph. Could we listen? It's broken. No problem. I'll fix it. Thanks, Katasonych. This is the best spot, Captain. But where will we land, Katasonych? In those bushes. It's a safe spot. Just tell the gunners to leave us a corridor. WELCOME Damn! Couldn't you have dug it deeper? You know who's on the other bank? Yes. Can't you bring them in? It's an hour's work at most. Anyway, have you got any boats? - No. Why are you lying? - What do you need them for? - I just do. You don't lie too well. - They're for the landing party. - That's what I need them for! A scouting mission? No, for a picnic with your phonograph. Will Ivan go again? ""Ivan, Ivan""! I'm not the information window! What's so funny? Oh, nothing. You have a pretty medical assistant. I'm sending her away. She can't cope with the job. You're too stern, Galtsev. You need a little tenderness inside. War is a man's business. It's not for girls. Fine, carry on. I don't need you here... ""man""! Excuse me, are you Masha? Yes. Don't you remember me? No, I don't. We took college entrance exams together. We sat at the same table. Yes, now I remember. I'm so glad I saw you. Me too. I'm so happy to find you. Where'd you go after the exams? I looked everywhere. Now I've found you. Coming! Now I've found you. We'll meet again, Masha! We'll meet again! WELCOME - Captain. - Ah, Katasonych. - They're here. - Fine. Show them in. - Hello, Kholin. - Hello, Ivan. Ivan? Hello. Galtsev, give us a hand. - Hello, Katasonych. - Sir. Galtsev, let's have some interesting magazines with lots of pictures. Come sit over here. This one's about scouts. I've read it. How about this one? That one too. - And this one? - I've read it. - You're lying. - I am not. All this time at HQ, I just sat and read. I did nothing but read for three days. I got you a spring for the phonograph at HQ. Thanks. It's under the bed. What's this? Spoils of war. - Any pictures? - It's all pictures. Let me see. You should hear him ""sprechen""... just like a Fritz. I wanted to take him on as an interpreter last year. Now he's in command of a battalion. Boy, look at that! Are these Germans? Yes. it's an old engraving. They're Fritzes all the same. This one on a horse... all skin and bones. I saw one just like him on a motorcycle. Look, they're trampling the people here too. It's just someone's imagination. Imagination! I know them. Is he a Fritz too? He's either a German doctor or writer. They have no writers. I saw them burning books in a square. They poured gasoline on them and set them on fire. There was soot in the air for a week. That writer lived 400 years ago. Well, then maybe. If they spot us, our gunners will keep them down. We'll open a passage for Ivan in the swamp. I'll be the last to retreat. Got that? What's this? I'll take one of Galtsev's boats. - Will you take me along? - Where? - The other bank. - Hear that? We've got a volunteer. Can you swim? - I can manage. I could swim this river five times. - You're quite a fellow. You're not trigger-happy, are you? Lay off! Hear that? He's got a short fuse. No self-control. How can I take you across? - Then you don't get a boat. - We'll just take one. Or I'll report you to the divisional commander. That's enough, you two. He'll give you a boat. Right? Enough of that. Let's go have a look. You stay here and rest up. What a knife! Galtsev, may I have it? I'd give it to you, but... Don't be greedy. Give it to him. It was my buddy's. He was killed. Let me have it till tonight. All right. Why should I go? You won't take me across, and you know where the boats are. Relax. Come on. I'll take you across after the war. They tell Masha not to go Beyond the river They tell Masha It's working now. We'll listen to it at dinner. You'll have a knife just like this. I'll get you one tomorrow. Tomorrow. - Where are his parents? - Whose? Ivan's. I don't know. His mother and sister were killed, I think. His dad was a border guard. Killed too, I think. I see. He's been through more than you can imagine. He was a partisan too, in several places. What'll become of him? The colonel or Katasonych will adopt him when the war's over. Why them and not you? I'd take him, but the colonel says I need bringing up myself. Galtsev here is certainly good at stealing boats. He only takes the best. How many boats have you stolen? Let's take this one. - No. - No what? He should be sent to the rear. A war's no place for children. There you go again. If we don't take him across, he'll go on his own. it'll only be worse. He's got just one thing on his mind: vengeance. Don't waste your breath explaining. They can't see beyond their own noses. We see just as much as you do. Didn't you say you wanted to adopt him? Will you lay off? Mind your own business! We'll manage on our own! Come on now. - Fine, Kholin. - Don't ""Kholin"" me! The colonel was right. You do need upbringing! Watch out, trouble-maker, or I'll report you to the commander. That's it. Keep cool... that's the main thing. Careful. And remember: We have to take him alive, understand? THERE ARE 8 OF US NONE OVER 19 IN ONE HOUR WE'RE TO BE TAKEN OUT AND SHOT AVENGE US Hurrah! Surround the building! Don't let him out! Hands up! Come out! Hiding, eh? You can't hide from me! Are you shaking? You'll answer for everything! I'll... You think I've forgotten? I'll sit in judgment at your trial! I'll... I'll... Welcome to our little tea party! Damn it! That was our best dinghy! Just thank God you're alive. You and your dinghy! Hurry! Can't you move any faster? Ivan! Don't be afraid. They'll stop soon. What is it, Ivan? I'm not afraid. I hear you were a partisan. - So? - Why'd you leave them? The Germans surrounded us in the woods. They sent me out by plane to a boarding school, but I ran away. You just eat up grain supplies while studying the importance of herbivores in man's life. Yeah, boarding school's not the thing. You ought to go to a military school. Has Kholin been coaching you? Why? Kholin's not the only one with brains. You've done your fighting. Rest up. Go back to school. You know who rests during wartime? Useless people! True enough. But war isn't your business. Not my business? Have you been to Trostyanets? - Where? - The death camp. Then what are you lecturing me about? What do you know? You're all plotting against me! Smoking again? Go on and smoke. It'll turn your lungs green. Green? So what? Nobody can see them. - I don't want you to smoke. - Okay, I won't. Let's have dinner before we start out. - Where's Katasonych? - He was summoned to HQ. He left? Without coming by to wish me good luck? He couldn't. It was urgent. Still, I can't imagine what could have happened. They know how badly we need him, but they go and summon him. He could've stopped by. Some friend! Will it just be the two of us? The three of us. He's joining us. What are you grinning about? Stop staring at me like a stuck pig. I'm serious. You volunteered. Getting cold feet now? No. It's just sort of unexpected. Unexpected? Everything in life is. May I come in? What is it? We've billeted the new men, Lieutenant. - Where? - Company 2 and Company 3. Very well. You may go. Yes, sir. I wouldn't take you, but it's an emergency. Make up your mind. I don't want to hear later, ""Kholin made me""! - What am I, a little boy? - Fine. Who'll you leave in command? Gushchin... commander of Company 5. If they find out you crossed the river without permission, we'll be in trouble. Although you'll only be gone for the night... AVENGE US Ivan, get up. Hear me? It's time. Katasonych didn't even stop by. I told you he couldn't. He loves you very much. I know. Still, he could have stopped by. Get dressed. Need help? - I'll manage. Jump up and down. To check if anything rattles. Your matches. Are you crazy? IN ONE HOUR WE'RE TO BE TAKEN OUT AND SHOT AVENGE US Gunners, to your posts! Go chat with the sentry so he won't notice us. Not a word. Just do it. - Got a light? - Just a sec. Who's that? It was all... so stupid, how it happened. They brought the boat here and had a smoke. The captain was here, and he was over there. He started climbing out of the trench. He started to rise and then suddenly slid back down. Real quiet. We didn't even hear a shot. ""Katasonych!"" the captain cried out. But he was dead. The captain said to leave him here till morning. Not a word. Just get the oars. Who's that? Kholin, who's that? Two of ours. Lakhov and Moroz. They went across after you. There's still time. Wait here. I'll be right back. - Come over here. it's drier. - Makes no difference now. An MG-34 - Are you afraid? A little. My nerves are on edge. I can't get used to begging. I'm sick of everything. They should be buried. - Who? Lakhov and Moroz. Of course we'll bury them. Quiet! It's all set. Everything's in place. Let's go. Here we are, boys. - How do you feel? - Fine. Well, I'll be going. - I'll go part of the way with you. - You're too big. They'll catch on. - Maybe I should go. The gully's all clay. You'll leave footprints. I said I'm going alone. See you soon. See you soon. See you soon. Just be careful. If the offensive starts, meet us in Fyodorovka. Go on now. - See you. - Good-bye, Ivan. Are you nuts? I want a smoke. - Want your mama too? - Bug off. I for one really do want my ma. - It's so dark. - Shoot off a flare. But carefully. Why are we wading around in this filth? There's no one here. Yeah, especially after we knocked off those other two. What's all this talk? Just keep moving. They'll spot the boat. The boat? What if they spot Ivan? Are you a louse or just stupid? - Stupid, I guess. - Your nerves are shot. See a doctor about that when the war's over. The gully's mostly clay, damn it. A good rain would wash away his footprints. I think he made it. Wait here. I'll go for the boat. When I come back, call out to me in German. What will you say? - Halt! If I'm caught, swim back. You said you could swim this river five times. What if you're wounded? Don't you worry about me. Halt! Quiet, damn you! Come here! Come on, hurry up. Who's that? Is it them? - Yes. It was them yesterday. Today it's us. Climb in. Are things quiet on the bank? - Yes. And you were afraid, you girl. Why aren't we going back? It's the first snow of the year. He might still be hiding and waiting. Jump! Let's drink to... They tell Masha Not to go beyond the river They tell Masha Not to love the young man May I come in, Lieutenant? Masha? Who were you talking to on the road? A friend? Yes. A friend. Does he wear glasses? He wasn't wearing glasses. But he does. He's a strange one. No, he isn't. What is it, Lieutenant? I've come to say good-bye. I'm transferring her to a hospital. Good idea. Hear that, Galtsev? Hear that, Masha? It's so quiet. The war... Victory! GERMAN IMPERIAL CHANCELLERY I know where that is. Come. I'll show you. - Is it far from here? - No, it's close by. Come closer. Can you identify these bodies? It's Goebbels and his wife and daughters. He poisoned his family with potassium cyanide. He ordered his troops to douse his corpse with gasoline and burn it. He can show you the place. He saw him only yesterday. Then last night he murdered his family and committed suicide. All right. Let's go. Will this be the last war on earth? Your nerves are shot. You should see a doctor about that. No, Kholin, wait a minute. You were killed... and I survived. I must think about this. Shot. Hanged. Shot. Hanged. Shot. Shot. Hanged. Hanged. Shot. Hanged. Where's the little bastard? Here on the left? Yeah, or the next one over. - You got the keys? - No, you do. There he is. Come on out, please. Come on, you little devil. We've got a thing or two to teach you. Come on! You mind hurrying it up a bit? Go on. Filthy partisan! Keep moving! These guys are so much trouble. - Hurry it up! - Forward! Here we are."
Tarkovsky,Nostalgia,"Thank God, we arrived. Speak Italian. Sorry. We've arrived. I stopped far away so we could go for a walk. It's a marvelous painting. I cried the first time I saw it. This light reminds me of the autumn in Moscow in Neskuchny Garden. - Come on. - I don't want to. I'll go ahead and wait for you inside. I don't want to. I already told you. I am fed up with all your beauties. I don't want to take it alone anymore. All this beauty of yours... I can't take it anymore. That's it. Do you want a baby too? Or are you asking God to spare you? I'm here just to have a look. Unfortunately, if there are any casual onlookers who aren't supplicants, then nothing happens. What is supposed to happen? Whatever you like, whatever you need most. But you should at least kneel down. - I can't. - Look at them. They're used to it. - They have faith. - Probably. Can I ask you something? Why do you think... it's only the women who pray so much? - You're asking me? - You see so many women here. I'm only the sacristan. I don't know these things. But you must wonder why women are more devout than men. You should know better than I. Because I'm a woman? No, I've never understood these things. I'm a simple man. But I think... a woman is meant to have children... to raise them... with patience... and self-sacrifice. That's all she's meant for? - I don't know. - Thank you. You've been a great help. You asked what I thought. I know... you want to be happy. There are more important things. Wait. Mother of all mothers, who knows the pain of being a mother. Mother of all mothers, who knows the joy of being a mother. Mother of all children, who knows the joy of having a child. Mother of all children, who knows the pain of not having a child. Mother who understands all, help your daughter to become a mother. I just don't understand you. You go on and on about the Madonna of Childbirth. We drove halfway across Italy in the fog. And you didn't even go in there to see her. What are you reading? Arseny Tarkovsky's poems. - In Russian? - No, it's a translation. Quite a good one. - Throw it away. - Why? The translator's a Very good poet. Poetry is untranslatable, like the whole of art. You may be right that poetry is untranslatable. But music? Music for example... What is it? What do you mean? It's a Russian song. You're right, but how could we have got to know Tolstoy, Pushkin... and so understand Russia? You don't understand anything about Russia. Nor you Italy then. If Dante, Petrarch and Machiavelli are useless. Sure. It's impossible for us poor devils. How can we get to know each other? By abolishing the frontiers. Which? Between states. Good morning. You know a maid in Milan set fire to the house? - Which house? - Her employers' house. - Why? - She was homesick. She missed her home and family down South. So she burned the thing that stopped her going back. Why did your musician, Sosnovsky, go back to Russia if he knew he'd be a slave again? Why won't you confide in me? I don't understand. Read this. You'll understand. What is it? The letter from the Bologna Conservatory? I wanted to ask you, was Sosnovsky successful when he returned to Russia? Was he happy? He started drinking and then... - He committed suicide? - Exactly. Here I am! I'm sorry, l was asleep. - Do you have any identification? - Yes. Here it is. I'll go and get the keys. Those aren't the other hotel keys, I hope? No, they're to my house. Here's your key. This way. Please. It's our best room. Good night, Andrei. Come with me. Your room is upstairs. It's nice here. It's still night, but the countryside's pretty too. There's the river, the mushrooms. People keep coming back, they often fall in love here. - You and your boyfriend will like it. - He's not my boyfriend. Go on, he's sad because he's in love. No, I think his mind's on other things. THE HOLY BIBLE - Did you knock? - I hadn't yet. Shall I ask to call Moscow? You haven't talked to your wife for two days. No, thanks. One, two, three. Go! Andrei. Andrei, get up! We'll be eating in half an hour. I'll be downstairs. It's lovely here. - St. Catherine used to come too. - I'm coming. Excuse me, Miss. What does this Russian do? - He's a poet. - Is he writing about Italy? He's writing the biography of a Russian musician. - Zoe! - And how come he is here? This musician studied in Bologna and came to these baths. - When? - At the end of the 1,700s. - Was it Tchaikovsky? - No, his name was Sosnovsky. - Wait. - Didn't he marry a local woman? No, he was in love with a Russian slave and died for her. What's the hurry? - Does your poet like Italy? - Too much so. But... I don't know. General, what's this strange music we keep hearing day in and day out? Wonderful music. Beats Verdi anytime. Hands off Verdi. This is Chinese stuff. A different civilization with no sentimental wails. Voice of God, of nature. Pretend they're not there. Just go on your way. It's gotten into my mouth. Move slowly. - What does it taste like? - It's a liquid sulfur. - So it's good for the skin. - Disgusting! I'm fine. I'm falling asleep. In the '60s a drowned body was found here. Don't talk about it, otherwise l get scared. In the war I've seen thousands of dead soldiers. Now listen, it's never too late to learn whatever happens, don't interfere. Have you heard their talk, what they're interested in? You've got to be different. You know why they're in the water? They want to live forever. Look who's here! Look at them! My cigar's gone out. Hand me the lighter, please? General! Why do they make fun of him? A few years ago, he shut himself up in the house with his family to wait for the end of the world. They stayed in for seven years. A religious fit, they say. Nonsense. It was jealousy. He was always jealous of his wife. Later she ran off with the children to Genoa. Jealous my foot, he's nuts. It's obvious. That's not it, he was just scared. - Scared of what? - Everything. You're wrong, he's a man of great faith. And how, he kept his family locked up for seven years. I was there when they broke down the door. His kid shot out like a rat and he chased after him. We thought he wanted to kill him. What faith! Here's the Russian poet. Miss, I don't smoke, but could l have a cigarette? Of course, as you don't smoke. - It's gone out. - So it has. Thank you. Never forget what he said to her. He who? And her? Saint Catherine! So what did God say to St. Catherine? ""You are she who is not, but I am he who is."" Did you hear that? Bravo, Domenico! Did he speak to St. Catherine himself? Be careful. He's not stupid. Of course not. Domenico has a degree. In what? I don't understand ""Faith."" What is it? Your Italian isn't so good, uh? It was better when you first came. What does ""faith"" mean? In Russian it's ""vera."" Why do they say he's mad? He's not mad. He has faith. There are lots of these lunatics at large in Italy. Asylums have been closed down but the families won't have them. And many must withdraw from others. We don't know what madness is. They're troublesome, inconvenient we refuse to understand them. They're alone. But they're certainly closer to the truth. He has another fixation now. What? He gets into the pool with a lighted candle. Nobody knows why. Everyone's afraid he wants to drown himself so they throw him out and save him. I don't believe it. Ask them. Can we ask him to have lunch with us? - When? - Now. Now, you don't know what time it is. - What time is it? - It's 7:00 in the morning. In the morning? Does that man with the wet shoes come often? - Who? Domenico? - Yes. So this is what it's all about. It depends. Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn't. - Where does he live? - Up above Bagno Vignoni. In the square, near the church. What's so funny? Andrei! - Stop. - Why? You're prettier... in this light. Redhead, redhead. You think so? I'm beginning to understand. What? Why do you think he locked up his family for seven years? How should I know? There he is. - Good-bye. - Thank you. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. I've brought a famous Russian writer. My life is normal, there's nothing interesting about it. It's true, but we hear you had a lovely experience. I read about it too, in the papers. Tell him about it. It's not worth it. Maybe not, but this gentleman has come from Moscow. For me? He's come a long way. - What did he say? - He doesn't feel like talking. - Let's go. - What? Try again, it's very important. Excuse me? - Stop for a minute. - Go! Look at that! Where are you going? What's wrong? Have you offended him? You've offended me! He's crazy. It's not up to me whether he talks or not. I'm sorry, but I'm going. If you care so much, try. You know a bit of Italian. If you don't like the way I work, say so. But believe me, not only am I a good translator, but I even improve on the original. I'm going back to Rome. Our trip's over. All right. Excuse me. I think I know why you do that. What? The bicycle? Before, with your family. I'm tired. Where are you? Come in! Did you hear that? It's Beethoven. One drop plus one drop makes a bigger drop, not two. - May I? - Smoke. When I don't know what to say I ask for a cigarette too. But I never learned to smoke. It's too hard. You have to learn to not smoke, to do important things. Such as? Some wine? We need bigger ideas. What? I was selfish before. I wanted to save my family. Everyone must be saved, the whole world. How? It's simple. You see the candle? All right. Why do you say ""all right""? Wait... You're confusing me. You need to cross the water with the lighted candle. - Which water? - The hot water. St. Catherine's pool, by the hotel, the steaming water. All right, when? Now... I can't do it. I don't want... When I light the candle and get into the water, they pull me out. They kick me out. And they shout, ""You're crazy!"" Get it? - All right. - All right? It's all wrong! Help me. - Help me. - All right, but... Of course. Where's the Russian who's going to Bagno Vignoni? The taxi's here. It's late. I must go. Thank you. Why me, of all people? - You've children? - Two, a girl and a boy. And your wife? Is she pretty? You know the Madonna of Childbirth? By Piero della Francesca. She's like that but all black. Go with the candle. We're planning something big in Rome. Zoe! Where are you? Zoe, answer me! Zoe, you know I'm scared of being alone. I know what you're thinking, but that's enough now. It's wrong to keep thinking the same thing. What do you want? Dad. Is this the end of the world? Good morning. Are we going? Stand back! They're letting them out! I knew they were in there. I used to listen in secret. The water had run out in my bathroom. I hope you won't kill me. - I thought you'd left. - No, I'm still here. - Good. - You don't look pleased. Look. Look what he gave me. - Who? - Domenico! Why are you afraid of everything? Full of complexes. You're not free. You all seem to want freedom, you talk about freedom... but when you get it you don't know what to do with it... or what it is. That's enough, that's enough. I know! It must be this country, the air one breathes here. Because in Moscow I met some wonderful men. What are you all after? These? Here! But not you. You're a kind of saint. You're interested in Madonnas. No! You're different. One ""intellectual"" tried to keep me locked up. Can't I ever meet the right man? I don't mean you, you're the worst. But I swear I'll find my kind of man. And I have, he's waiting for me in Rome. You dress badly too. And you're boring. Do you know what a boring man is? I'll tell you. You're the kind I'd sleep with rather than explain why l don't feel like it. What are you saying, Eugenia? Don't you see? I found myself in a most embarrassing position. I've had enough! I can't take any more! I'd like to sleep for 10 days and wipe you out. Maybe there's nothing to wipe out because you don't exist. It's my problem. I know why I like idiots. I mean... Men with no charm, because... I might look young, but I know all about charm. Go, go, please. You know... when I met you, that same night... I dreamt that a soft worm with lots of legs... fell on my head. It stung me. It was poisonous. I kept shaking my head until it fell off. I tried to squash it... before it reached the wardrobe but it was no good, because... because I kept just missing it. I just couldn't... squash it. Since that night... I keep touching my hair. Thank God there's been nothing between us! Just the thought makes me sick! She's insane. Run back to your wife! Though you nearly betrayed her! You're a pig, like everyone else. Even worse... Anything else? Hypocrite! We're going to listen to some music. - What's going on? - Nothing, nothing. Oh, God! Now the General and his Chinese music! But you won't drive me away! Dear Pyotr Nikolayevich, I've been in Italy 2 years, very important ones, both for my profession as a musician and for my everyday life. Last night I had a bad dream, I had to stage an opera in the theater of My Lord the Count. The first act was set in a park full of statues, but they were naked men painted in white, forced to stand motionless. And I was a statue too. I knew I would be harshly punished if I moved because our lord and master was watching us. I could feel the cold rising from my marble pedestal... as the autumn leaves settled on my upraised arm. Yet I stood still. But when, exhausted, I sensed I could resist no longer, I awoke. I was afraid. For I knew it had been no dream, but my reality. I could try not to return to Russia, but the thought kills me. Because I would die if I never again saw my homeland... the birches, the air of my childhood... An affectionate greeting from your abandoned friend, Pavel Sosnovsky. Maria. Andrei! As a child I fell ill from hunger and fear. I tear shreds of skin from my lips. In my memory I lick traces of salt, of freshness. And still I walk. I sit on a doorstep, looking for warmth. I stagger deliriously as to the piper's tune. I was hot, I opened my collar and I lay down. The trumpets sounded. A light pierced my eyelids. High above the pavement mother flies, beckons with her hand... and flies away. Now beneath the apple trees, I dream of a white hospital. As a child I fell ill. I must go and see Dad. I have a jacket in the wardrobe. It's been there three years. I'll wear it again when I'm home in Moscow. I never go anywhere, I never see anyone. What are you doing here? Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid of me. It's I who should be afraid of you. You could shoot me. You know, everyone shoots in Italy. And there are too many Italian shoes. Dreadful! Everyone buys them. Why? These are 10 years old. It's not important. All right. You know the great love stories, the classics. No kissing. No kissing. Nothing at all. Very pure. Hence great. Feelings unspoken are unforgettable. Here it's like in Russia. I don't know why. You know... I don't speak Italian well. Here's a story. A man saves another who was sinking into a slimy pond... thereby risking his own life. Now they are both lying on the edge of the pond out of breath, exhausted. The rescued man says, ""Idiot. Why did you do that? I live in there!"" I live in there. He took great offense. - What's your name? - Angela. Angela, good girl. Are you happy? About what? About life. About life, yes. Good girl. Sight grows dim, my strength is two occult, adamantine darts. Hearing weavers for my father's house breathes distant thunder. The tissues of hard muscles weaken like hoary oxen at the plow and no longer when night falls do two wings gleam behind me. During the party, like a candle I wasted away. Gather up at dawn my melted wax and read in it whom to mourn, what to be proud of. How, by donating the last portion of joy to die lightly and in the shelter of a makeshift roof to light up posthumously, like a word. Why must I think of this? I have enough worries. My God, why did I do it? They're my children, my family, my own flesh and blood. How could I? Years without seeing the sun, fearing the light of day. Why? Why this tragedy? Lord, do you see how he's asking? Say something to him. But what would happen if He heard my voice? Let Him feel your presence. I always do, but He's not aware of it. I'll bring the car around in 10 minutes. Mr. Gorchakov, phone call for you. - For me? - Yes. Please, wait a minute. - In the lobby. - Thank you. Hello? It's Eugenia. - How are you? - Fine. - Guess why I called? - Maybe because... No, no... Your Domenico is here, the lunatic from Bagno Vignoni. Sorry, I know he's not mad. It was so you'd understand. He's here in Rome for a demonstration. They do weird things. He's been making speeches for three days. Like Fidel Castro. - Come and say good-bye to him. - I'm leaving. - When? - Immediately. Domenico asked me about you. He keeps asking if you've done what you were supposed to do. Of course. I'll tell him right away, he's been waiting for this news. Thank you. I'm glad we could say good-bye. I'm leaving too, you know? I'm going away with Vittorio. We haven't decided yet, but we'll probably go to India. Vittorio's my man, he's interested in spiritual issues. He's from a distinguished family in Orvieto. Good, Eugenia, I wish you all the best. Same to you. Say hello to Moscow for me. How's your health? How's your heart? I don't know, I've reached the limit. I'm bored. I want to go home. Good-bye, Vittorio. I'm going to buy some cigarettes. I want to change my ticket. I'm leaving in two days' time. - What's happened? - Nothing. Can you drive me to Bagno Vignoni? - When? - Now. - Yes, but we'll have to advise — - Right. - I wait, right? - Right. I had a feeling you wouldn't leave today. What ancestor speaks in me? I can't live simultaneously in my head and in my body. That's why I can't be just one person. I'm capable of feeling an infinite number of things at the same time. There are no great masters left. That's the real evil of our time. The heart's path is covered in shadow. We must listen to the voices that seem useless. In brains full of long sewage pipes of school wall, tarmac and welfare papers the buzzing of insects must enter. We must fill the eyes and ears of all of us with things that are the beginning of a great dream. Someone must shout that we'll build the pyramids. It doesn't matter if we don't. We must fuel that wish... and stretch the corners of the soul, like an endless sheet. If you want the world to go forward... we must hold hands... We must mix the so-called healthy with the so-called sick. You healthy ones! What does your health mean? The eyes of all mankind are looking at the pit into which we are plunging. Freedom is useless if you don't have the courage to look us in the eye, to eat, drink, and sleep with us. It's the so-called healthy who have brought the world to the verge of ruin. Man, listen! In you, water, fire and then ashes. WE'RE NOT CRAZY WE'RE SERIOUS And the bones in the ashes. The bones and the ashes. Wait for me in the car. Hello. Where am I when I'm not in reality or in my imagination? Here's my new pact with the world: it must be sunny at night and snowy in August. Great things end, small things endure. Society must become united again, instead of so disjointed. Just look at nature and you'll see that life is simple. We must go back to where we were, to the point where you took the wrong turn. We must go back to the main foundations of life... without dirtying the water. What kind of world is this, if a madman tells you... you must be ashamed of yourselves! Music now. - Music! - Music! I forgot this. Oh, mother! The air is that light thing... that moves around your head and becomes clearer when you laugh. The music doesn't work! TOMORROW IS THE END OF THE WORLD To the memory of my mother."
Tarkovsky,Sacrifice,"Come here and give me a hand, boy! Once upon a time, long ago an old monk lived in an Orthodox monastery. His name was Pamve. And once he planted a barren tree on a mountainside just like this. Then he told his young pupil, a monk named Ioann Kolov, that he should water the tree each day until it came to life. Put a few stones there, will you? Anyway, early every morning Ioann filled a dipper with water and went out. He climbed up the mountain and watered the withered tree and in the evening when darkness had fallen he returned to the monastery. He did this for three years. And one fine day, he climbed up the mountain and saw that the whole tree was covered with blossoms! Say what you will, but a method, a system, has its virtues. You know, sometimes I say to myself, if every single day, at exactly the same stroke of the clock, one were to perform the same single act, like a ritual, unchanging, systematic, every day at the same time, the world would be changed. Yes, something would change. It would have to. One could wake up in the morning, let's say, get up at exactly seven, go to the bathroom, pour a glass of water from the tap, and flush it down the toilet. Only that! I'll be hard to get rid of today! Beautiful, eh? Like Japanese Ikebana. I will come to your house to wish you well on your birthday. I am very honored by the invitation! Here's the last of it. The post office is closed. Anyone who turns up now will just have to wait till tomorrow. Here! I don't have my glasses. Please read it. ""Happy Birthday, dear friend STOP. Mighty Richard greets good Prince Myshkin STOP. God grant you joy, health and peace STOP. From your loyal and loving Richardians and Idiotists STOP."" Oh, how touching! A joke. Friends, and their jokes! ""Idiotists..."" That's not half bad. ""God grant you joy..."" Say, how is your relationship to God? Non-existent, I'm afraid. What do you mean? It could be worse. Here you are... a famous journalist, a theatrical and literary critic, who lectures on aesthetics for students at the university. Hey, your lasso! Run and fetch it! And essays... you write them too. But you're so gloomy! What's that supposed to mean, ""gloomy""? Well, you shouldn't grieve so much. You shouldn't yearn so for something. You shouldn't be waiting like that. That's important. One shouldn't be waiting for something. ""Shouldn't be waiting""? Who says I'm waiting for anything? We all are... waiting for something! Take me, for example. All my life I've been going around waiting for something. All my life, in fact, I've felt as if... as if I were waiting in a railway station. And I've always felt as if... as if the living I've done, so far, hasn't actually been real life but a long wait for it... a long wait for something real, something important! What about you? Yes, if that’s what you mean. I just never knew you were interested in that kind of problem. But I am! I most certainly am! Unfortunately. Sometimes I get the most peculiar notions. Yes, I mean it. Like that dwarf, for example. That notorious dwarf! What dwarf? Look here, you've managed to muddle me up completely! Oh, you know who I mean. That hunchback! Eh? The one Nietzsche mentioned. The one who made Zarathustra faint. Faint? What are you talking about? I say, do you know Nietzsche? No, not personally. I haven't really studied him all that carefully. However... he interests me, I can't deny it. So? Sometimes I get silly things in my head, things like this ""eternal recurrence."" We live, we have our ups and downs. We hope. We wait for something. We hope, we lose hope, we move closer to death. Finally, we die and are born again. But we remember nothing. And everything begins again, from scratch. Not literally the same way, just a wee, wee bit different. But it's still so hopeless and we don't know why. Yes... No, I mean. Really, it's quite the same, literally, the same. Just the next performance, so to speak. If I'd made it all, I guess I'd have done things the same way. Funny, eh? But I've heard all that, it's nothing new. You didn't invent it! Do you really think that mankind could devise a universal concept, a model, so to speak, of Absolute Law, of Absolute Truth? Why, it'd be like trying to create a new universe! To be a demiurge! And you actually believe in your dwarf, do you? In your ""recurrence""? Yes... Sometimes I do... You understand? If I truly believe, it will be so. ""Believe that it hath been given and it shall be given unto you."" But now I think I'll head home. It's late, I must think of a gift. You needn't do that. This is a very important day! You'll be buried in telegrams! Au revoir! What? What are you mumbling about? In the beginning was the Word. But you are mute, mute as a fish. A little smelt. Look here, my boy, we've lost our way. Humanity is also on the wrong road, a dangerous road. So, up you go! Dear, how heavy you are. The first impression that Man had... How has he been lately? All right? Yes. In what way? He works a lot. I don't like his monologues. Alexander! Doctor! Wait, we'll come to you. You're not equipped for a jaunt through Africa. It's quite a job, you know. - Hello. - Hello! Welcome. - Many happy returns. - Thanks, thanks. And you, young man, how are you? Isn't it hard to keep silent? I can well imagine. But it's good for you. Sociability is a burden. Not all of us can bear it. - My brave boy. - Why ""my""? He's ""ours,"" after all. He gargles and goes to bed by himself. Gargles? That's nothing! Think how well he behaved during the operation. He's got the makings of a real man! Open wide, now. It looks fine. Keep that up and you'll be talking in a week. By the way, did you know that Gandhi had one day in the week when he spoke to no one? - It was his system. - Why? He was probably tired of people. Shall we walk here? You've deserted your patients. And what elegance! On a day like this, one has to live up to expectations. Your present's in the trunk. Still more presents! - It's time we went home. - Yes, all of us. But why don't you two take the car? We'll follow on foot. We must finish our chat. Right, my boy? Please don't be too late. All right, little man? Everything's almost ready. Have I told you how your mother and I found this place? We came here on a trip once. You weren't even thought of then. It was the first time we were here. We had no map with us, we forgot to bring one. Besides, we'd run out of gas. We stopped somewhere near here, then we kept going on foot. Frankly, we were lost. Then it started raining, a cold, ugly drizzle. We came to that bend over there, by that dry old pine tree and just then, the sun came out. It stopped raining. The light was dazzling! Then we saw the house. Suddenly I was sad that I didn't... I mean, that we didn't live there in that house under the pines, so close to the sea. How beautiful it was! I knew that if I lived there, I'd be happy until I died. Hmm? What's wrong? Don't be afraid. There is no such thing as death. No, there's the fear of death, and that is an awful fear. Sometimes it even makes people do things they shouldn't. But how different things would be if only we could stop fearing death! Huh? Oh, I was talking about something else... Ah, yes. As I was saying, we were enchanted as we took in the beauty of it. We couldn't tear ourselves away. The peace, the stillness... And... it was plain that this house was meant just for us. It turned out to be for sale, too. What a miracle! And you were born in this house. Do you like it? Do you like your house? Eh, my boy? Man has defended himself, always against other men, against nature. He has constantly violated nature. The result is a civilization built on force, power, fear, dependence. All our ""technical progress"" has only provided us with comfort, a sort of standard. And instruments of violence for keeping power. We are like savages! We use the microscope like a cudgel! No, that's wrong... savages are more spiritual than we! As soon as we make a scientific breakthrough we put it to use in the service of evil. And as for standard, some wise man once said that sin is that which is unnecessary. If that is so, then our entire civilization is built on sin, from beginning to end. We have acquired a dreadful disharmony, an imbalance, if you will, between our material and our spiritual development. Our culture is defective. I mean, our civilization. Basically defective, my boy! Perhaps you mean that we ought to study the problem and look for a solution together. Perhaps we could, if it wasn't so late. Altogether too late. God, how weary I am of this talk! ""Words, words, words!"" At last I know what Hamlet meant. He was fed up with windbags. And so am I! Why do I talk this way? If only someone could stop talking and do something instead! Or at least, try to. Little Man! Little Man! Dear God, what's wrong with me? Fantastic! Such remarkable refinement! Such wisdom and spirituality. And such pure childlike innocence as well. At once profound, yet virginal. It's unbelievable. Like a prayer. And all this has been lost. We can't even pray any longer. I had a rotten day today. Or rather, a day I lost control of. Thank you, Victor. A splendid book! Thanks for the wine too. We'll have it later. Above all, thanks for coming. Have you... never felt that your life was a failure? No. Why? I once felt exactly that way. But since Little Man came along, all that has changed. Not all at once, of course. A bit at a time as he grew bigger. I'm very attached to him, too much, I'm afraid. But there is something in all this that I resent. I prepared myself for a life, a higher life, so to speak. I studied philosophy, the history of religion, aesthetics. And I ended up putting myself in chains, of my own free will. But at the same time, I'm happy. Today, for example... What happened today? I got a telegram from my friends. As a joke they signed it: ""Richardians and Idiotists"". Old theater friends. We played Shakespeare and Dostoyevsky. - I remember. - No. - Remember what? - Those performances. - Oh, come now. - Yes, I do! I remember how you dropped that vase from the tray and broke it. And your eyes were full of tears. I remember it well. The vase, too. It was white, with blue flowers. That's right! She does remember. But those tears meant nothing. I had something in my eye. It hurt so, I didn't think I'd get through the performance. Alexander was superb as Prince Myshkin. That role made you. And then you just gave it all up. The theater, the lot. You threw away everything after Richard III and The Idiot. I don't know why. - What ""everything""? - Hmm? What do you mean by ""everything""? The theater. Everything! ""Success,"" that's what you mean! As it happens, theater isn't ""everything."" I couldn't take it anymore. What do you mean? Well... For some reason, I started feeling embarrassed onstage. I was ashamed to impersonate someone else, to play another's emotions. But worst of all, I was ashamed of being honest onstage. It was a critic who first saw that. But it wasn't sudden, not at all. So you mean that an actor may not keep his ego intact? That he must lose his identity? No, not quite. What I mean is that an actor's identity dissolves in his roles. I didn't want my ego dissolved. There was something in it that struck me as sinful something feminine and weak. Aha! Feminine! So that's what's sinful. I liked you as an actor, so you quit. That's it! - I don't know. That might be it. - No, that was it! I said it might be. Always the last word! She'll be his death! Please, not today. It's Alexander's birthday. Thanks for defending me, Victor. In other words, first he seduced me with his acting. Then he lured me from London and abandoned me! But I liked being the great actor's wife. Forgive me, but I saw no harm in it. Who's that, now? By the way, Alexander, I'll soon be leaving. Leaving? Leaving all this. Has something happened? I've been offered a clinic in Australia. Are you serious? You must tell me about it later. It's Otto, the postman. He's carrying something. Julia! Your beau's come calling! Good evening! - Many happy returns! - Thanks. Here I am, and here's a kind of present for you. Thank you very much. What is it? I don't think I can do this alone. It's a map of Europe, from the late 1600's. Is it genuine? How could it be? It must be a copy, a reproduction. No, not at all! It's genuine, an original. - How could anyone... - Is it possible? How beautiful it is! We must take it inside. Come, now. But it's far too dear a gift. I don't know if I... Oh God, don't say that! But it's far too much. Too much, Otto! I know it's no sacrifice, but... And why shouldn't it be? Of course it's a sacrifice! Every gift involves a sacrifice. If not, what kind of gift would it be? Excuse me... Otto. My name is Otto. Oh. Excuse me, Otto. What are you doing in these parts? I hear you haven't lived here long. Smoke? Once I went to the morgue and saw the autopsied corpse... of a man who had smoked all his life. I saw his lungs. I haven't smoked since. Hear that, Alexander? Yes, you're completely right. I've only lived here two months. Before then, I taught history at a secondary school. But when I was pensioned, I moved here. And here I am. Nowadays I have fewer expenses, and more time left over for my interests. My sister used to live here. She's dead now. I understand you're employed by the post office. Yes, I'm a postman. But not regularly. Only in my spare time. Hello, Maria! I've put everything in order, Mrs. Adelaide. Can I go now? Yes, yes, Maria. Thank you. Oh, yes! Do you think you might just warm the plates? Julia can do the rest. Yes, Mrs. Adelaide. I'll put the plates to warm at once. I'll warm the plates. Then can I go? Is there something more? No, no! You may go. Julia's still here. Oh, one more thing! Would you put the candles on the table? Then you may go... You have opened the wine, haven't you? Well, open it. Then you won't be needed. The plates, the candles, the wine. We're neighbors, she and I. We're acquainted. Indeed? Congratulations. She came from Iceland a few years ago. Really? She is very odd. Who? Maria. Yes, Maria. Sometimes she scares me. It must've been lovely when men thought the world looked like this! This Europe looks more like Mars. That is, it has nothing to do with truth. No. But people lived then. And not badly, either. But wait, what's the date... ...today? 1392... It's best we put the map away now. Otto, will you help me? I have a feeling that our maps have nothing to do with truth, either. What truth? You keep going on about truth. - Truth! What is truth? - There's no such thing. We look, but don't see. Here comes a cockroach... A cockroach!? Par example, madame! Excusez-moi! Here comes a cockroach running 'round a plate. He fancies that he's moving forward with a definite purpose. How do you know what a cockroach thinks? It could be a ritual. - Yes! - His own. Aha. ""Could be."" Anything could be. ""Could be""! Otherwise all we're left with is this ""truth,"" ""truth."" - Can I help? - No, that's fine. Let's put it there, Otto. A fantastic map! I'm glad you think so. It's a first-class chart. Where's Little Man? Where's the boy? I don't know. He was here just a moment ago. - Shall I look? - No, no. He seemed down, to me. - Something wrong? - I'll be right back. Dinner's ready. You said you had more time for your interests... What'd you mean? Huh? Take it easy. He's around here. - I'm sort of a collector. - Are you? What do you mean, ""sort of""? How shall I put it? I collect incidents. Things that are unexplainable but true. I need a lot of time, though, to gather evidence that they're true. I need to travel, too, and I need money for it. That's why I'm a postman... as well. Unexplainable? Little Man should be here. He loves stories like this. Does he, indeed? But still... I don't really understand. Well, for example... No, not that one. How about this one... It happened before the war. In Königsberg, a widow was living with her son. But then war broke out, and the boy was drafted. He was 18 years old. They decided to see a photographer and have a keepsake photo taken. The mother and her son were photographed together. Then the boy... the boy was sent off... to the front. A few days later, he was killed. Good Lord! In the midst of all the commotion and calamity the widow, of course, forgot about the photos. ""Of course""? Why, how could she forget such a thing? - It's not important. - No, it's not very important at all. The fact is, this woman never fetched the photographs. The war ended. She moved to another town far from her memories. But didn't she even try to find the photographer? It was her last photo of her son! But do let him make his point. Sorry. - Mommy...! - I'll be quiet. Sorry. It doesn't matter. Some years later... I think it was in 1960... the widow visited a photographer to have her photo taken. She intended to give it to a friend. The photo was taken, but when she got the prints she saw not only herself on them, but her dead son, too. In the photos, he was 18 and she was as old as she was when these last photos were taken. Did it happen like that? Just as you told us? Yes. That's how it happened. How did you check it? I've spoken with the woman. And I have the photo showing her in 1960 and her son in a 1940 uniform. Oh, dear God! And besides... I have a copy of his birth certificate and an official copy of the notice of death. Are you pulling our leg? No, by no means! I have about 300 similar incidents. 284, to be exact. We are blind, simply. We see nothing. What was that? What do you think? Are you ill? No... nothing's wrong. It was only an evil angel passing by, who saw fit to touch me. And you see fit to joke with us, eh? Mr. Postman? There are jokes and then there are jokes, Doctor. There's nothing to joke about here. ""Which of you have done this?"" ""The Lords...?"" Maria! Who made that? Little Man. Little Man, really? - Where is he? - He's upstairs. I think he's in his room. That's good. But what is it? He made it for you. It's his birthday present to you. It was he and Otto, the postman, who built it together. Don't say that I told you, Mr. Alexander. He wanted to show it off himself. I'll go now. Happy birthday. Go home now! It's so damp out. - May I come in? - Yes, come in. Oh, it's you. Come in! Things are almost ready downstairs. What on earth is that? What's what? The picture, there. On the wall, what is it? I can't see clearly. It's behind a glass. And it's so dark. It’s the Adoration of the Three Kings by Leonardo. A reproduction, of course. My God, how sinister it is! I've always been terrified of Leonardo. ...are now being organized nationwide... This is even the duty of all officers of the army. Every responsible citizen... is expected to behave with courage... to keep a cool head... and to help the army... in its efforts to re-establish peace, order, and discipline. The only dangerous enemy in our midst at the moment, It is contagious, and won't allow itself to be ruled by common sense. Order and organization... and nothing less, good citizens. Only order... order... against this chaos. I beg you, I humbly appeal to your courage and... in spite of all... to your common sense. Shall we eat? And wake the boy? We have here, unfortunately, such a base... with four missile warheads. And it is very likely... that these warheads, tragically enough... What's this? ...will be used against us. Communications may be broken at any time... but I have told you what is most important... ...my fellow citizens. You are to stay where you are. There is no place in all of Europe that is safer than where we are now. In this regard, we are all forced into the same situation. All districts will be under the control of special military units... so that... so that... Surely this isn't... Shouldn't one do something? I've waited for this all my life. My whole life has been one long wait, for this. Don't touch me! Do something! You men! Why don't you say something? Can't we do something? Mama, please calm down! My God! Victor! At least you could do something! Please! Shh! The boy is asleep. He mustn't be awakened. It's all my fault! This is my punishment! The boy's sleeping. Don't wake him. - Little Man! Where is he? - He's sleeping. Julia! Go get Little Man! Alexander, don't you even understand? Julia! Fetch the black bag by the piano. Maybe later. Oh, God! Put it on the table! Alexander! I can't bear it anymore! Please, please! Julia, do you need one, too? No, I don't want it! It's not necessary. Yes, it is. It's absolutely necessary. And it's completely harmless. It will be easier for all of us if you take it. No! I don't want to! - And you, Alexander? - No, I'll have a drink instead. Just don't drink too much. It'll only make it worse. Otto? Oh no, don't worry. Thanks, but I don't need it. Julia? We must go up to the boy. He's not to wake up now! I'll go with you. Julia can stay with Mama. Sleep now, sleep. We'll be right back. It's dead. The telephone's dead. Oh, dear God... Why do we always do the opposite of what we want? Always! I have loved one man... and married another. Why? Would you like something to drink? No, no. Nothing. Thanks, Otto. No. I think I know, now. We simply don't want to depend on anyone. When two people love each other, they don't love in the same way. One of them is strong, the other, weaker. And the weaker is always the one who loves without reckoning... without reservation. It feels now as if I've awakened from some kind of dream... after some other kind of life. For some reason, I always offered resistance. I fought against something. I defended myself, just as though I'd had... someone else inside me, saying: Don't give in to anything... don't go along with... anything... ...or you’ll die! But God, how foolish we are anyway! That's good. It's good that you finally understood that. How do you feel? - Better now? - Yes. I've finally understood, even though it's a bit late. But what shall we do now? The telephone isn't working, of course. We could get into the car and drive north, where it's quieter... But it's no use. No. It's the same everywhere. And no one knows where it's worst. No, no! We'll stay here. There, there... Easy, easy... We won't go anywhere! We're staying here! Victor! And now... Now we shall eat dinner. Excuse me, but I must go now. I have a few things to put in order. What will you do, Martha? Julia. Go wake Little Man! Today is a very special day. We must be together. Please stop it! Julia, did you hear me? - It's best not to wake him. -Julia! I'm not going to wake him. I have no intention of doing it. And I won't allow anyone else to, either. He's asleep now, and we mustn't wake him, or frighten him. A lot can happen while he's sleeping. If God wills it, he'll never know what's happened. Don't scare him! Please, I beg you! If you have to torture someone, let it be Mr. Alexander. Or me, for that matter. Choose whom you will, since you can't do otherwise. But I will not allow you to torture the boy. My dear girl... My poor, dear girl... Forgive me. Our Father, Who... Our Father, Who art in Heaven... hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come... Thy will be done... Give us this day our daily bread... And deliver us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom... and the Power... and the Glory. Amen. Lord! Deliver us in this terrible time. Don't let my children die, nor my friends... my wife... Victor... all those who love Thee and believe in Thee... All those who do not believe in Thee, because they are blind... those who haven't given Thee a thought... simply because they haven't yet been truly miserable. All those who in this hour have lost their hope, their future... their lives... and the opportunity to surrender to Thy will. All those who are filled with dread who feel the end coming closer... who fear, not for themselves, but for their loved ones. All those whom no one, except Thou, can offer protection. Because this war is the ultimate war a horrible thing. And after it, there will be no victors and no vanquished... no cities or towns, grass or trees, water in the wells, or birds in the sky. I will give Thee all I have. I'll give up my family, whom I love. I'll destroy my home, and give up Little Man. I'll be mute, and never speak another word to anyone. I will relinquish everything that binds me to life... if only Thou dost restore everything as it was before... as it was this morning and yesterday Just let me be rid of... this deadly... sickening, animal fear! Yes, everything! Lord! Help me... I will do everything I have promised Thee. Come here, Victor. Help me! My boy! - What is it? - Sorry to get you up. - Were you asleep? - What is it? What's happened? There's still one last chance! A chance? What kind of chance? A chance. One last hope. What kind of hope? What's the matter with you? Nothing's the matter with me. But Maria can do it. Maria! Maria? Which Maria? Do what? You must go to her and convince her. Do you understand? Where must I go? Whom must I convince? Come in, have a drink. I had one and I feel better. There's no light anymore. How long have I slept? You shouldn't drink that by the glassful. It's very good cognac, that. Where is everybody? Are they sleeping? They're downstairs, sitting 'round the table. - They're very fond of you. - Sitting 'round what table? You must go to Maria at once! Which Maria? Can't you express yourself more clearly? Maria, you know her! One of your servant girls. Yes, yes, yes! I'll explain later. Don't rush me! Who's rushing you, for God's sake! Why do you always have to beat around the bush? She lives... on a farm on the other side of the bay. Behind the church. It's closed now. Who? ""Who""? I'm not talking about ""who."" I mean the church. But I asked who lives there. What's the church got to do with it? Who lives there? Why, Maria, of course. Your servant. I've been trying to tell you that for half an hour! Can't you pay more attention! This is very important. Pay attention? I... I know where she lives. My wife showed me. Oh, I think that... I... Yes, it's quite all right. It's all right, believe me. I'll sit here by you. What was it you said about the servant? Oh, yes, your servant girl... - Did you hear? - Hear what? What was that? I don't know... I don't know. I thought it sounded like music. In any case, you must go to Maria! But why? Don't you want all of this to be over and done with? For what to be done with? Everything! The whole lot! God, Otto! There is an end to this. Otto! Yes. You must go to Maria and lie with her. What? I say, you must go and lie with Maria! Lie with Maria? It's very simple. She lives alone. And if you only wish for one thing at that moment: That all this will be over, then it will be! There'll be no more of it! But that's madness, Otto! Good God, Otto. You don't understand a thing. It's true! It's a holy truth. She has very special qualities, you know. I've gathered evidence. She is a witch! In what sense? In the best sense. Are you joking again? Still having me on with your Nietzschean pranks? Is there any other way out? There is no other alternative. None, whatsoever. What alternative, Otto? What alternative? What are you talking about? It's best if I go now. I've left the bike for you... down there by the shed. Don't take the car, they'll hear you. I've put a ladder against the balcony. Go to Maria... but be careful! There are a couple of broken spokes in the front wheel. I once caught my pants-leg in them. I almost fell in the water. - What pants-leg? - The right one. Be careful! Have you finally understood what I told you? Do you hear what I'm saying? Yes, what about it? No... never! Anyway, I prefer Piero della Francesca! As I understood Alexander's words, he meant that it is peculiar for a man to change, of his own free will, into a work of art. Generally, the result of all poetic striving lies so far from its author that one can hardly believe that it is a man-made creation. In the case of the actor, though, the reverse is true. The actor is, himself, his own creation, his own work of art. Excuse me. - I'll be right back. - Don't stay long. How much gas do we have left? Will it last? I don't know. I'll see. They brought new tanks last week. Don't you remember? Julia! Come here to us. - Who is it? - It's me. Mr. Alexander? Has something happened? But why stand there? Come in. It was only by chance that I heard you knock. The kerosene gave out, so I got up to fill the lamp. Has something happened? Why don't you say anything? What is it? Is it something at home? Something's happened at your house again. Is that it? But don't you... don't you have a TV? Yes, a small one. But... it went dead about 11:00, and didn't come on again. What... What's happened to your hands? I fell off the bike. Did you come on a bike? Yes, I did. I fell. Come! You mustn't go about with dirty hands. Thank you. You're welcome. As a child, I played this prelude. My mother loved it. Years ago, before I was married, I often went to visit my mother... in the country. She was still alive in those days. Her house, a little cottage, was surrounded by a garden... a little garden, dreadfully neglected and overgrown. No one had tended it for many years and I don't think... anyone had ever been in it. Even then, my mother was very ill. She almost never left the house. Still, amidst the ruin of the garden there was something that was, in its way, beautiful. Yes, now I know what it was. When the weather was fine... she often sat at the window... looking out at the garden. She even had a special chair by the window. Once, though, I decided that I would tidy things up... in the garden, that is. I wanted to mow the grass, burn the weeds, prune the trees. On the whole, I wanted to redo the garden in my own taste... with my own hands. Yes, simply to please my mother. And for two solid weeks... I went at it with shears and a scythe. I dug... and cut... and sawed... and weeded... I kept my nose to the ground, literally. And I took great pains to get it ready as soon as possible. My mother's condition grew worse, and she kept to her bed. But I wanted her to be able... to sit by the window and see... her new garden. In short, when I was finished and everything was ready... I took a bath... put on fresh underwear, a new jacket, even a tie. Then I sat down in the chair to see what I'd made, through her eyes, as it were. I... I sat there... and looked out through the window. I had prepared myself to enjoy the sight. Anyway, I looked out the window and saw... What did I see? Where had all the beauty gone? The naturalness of it? It was so disgusting. All that evidence of violence! I remember once when my sister was young. She went to a barber and had her hair cut. It was the fashion then. Her hair was unbelievably lovely. Golden yellow, like Lady Godiva's. She came home pleased as punch. Then my father saw her. He began to cry. I think it was the same with the garden. And your mother? It's three o'clock! We won't have time... But your mother... did she see it? Maria... My being here must be an imposition on you. You can't sleep. What do you mean? What do you mean? Could you... Could you love me, Maria? What are you saying? Love me, I beg you! Save me. Save us all! I know who you are. He... He told me! Please, please. Save us, I beg you! What are you talking about? Go home now. Do you want me to go with you? I... I have a bicycle, too. Don't kill us. Save us, Maria. But why? You poor, poor man. Why? No, not that way! You poor man. Don't be afraid. What's wrong? Who has frightened you so? Calm down, calm down. I understand, I know... that it concerns your home. I know her, she is wicked. I know her. They've hurt you... frightened you. Don't be afraid of anything. Everything's going to be all right. Be calm. Don't be afraid, not of anything. It's all right now, all right. You poor, poor man. There, there. There's nothing to fear. Don't be afraid. Nothing will happen to you here. Don't cry, don't cry. Everything will be fine. -Just love me. - Yes. My poor dear. What have they done to you? There, there... No... no. What is it? - Calm down! - No, no! I c-c-can't! I can't! Drink this. No. There... It'll soon be over. What's frightened you so, Alexander? Mama! Hello! Hello, is it Martin? Yes. Alexander? Yes, it's me. Your voice is so weak. Oh. Better now? - Yes, it's better. - I wonder, is the editor in? Yes, but I don't think he's free. You can't imagine what things are like here today. You were to see him next week. Yes, but it wasn't important. A trifle... it doesn't matter. I'll call back. All right, until then. By the way, congratulations! On what? Oh, of course! Mama, did you know that our Victor is leaving for Australia? What'd you say? To Australia? Yes, and he's not coming back. He's been offered his own clinic. I heard it last night. Right, Victor? - Why are you laughing? - I'm not laughing! When did you decide that? Australia! You must be mad! I don't know why I chose Australia. I don't know. It doesn't matter. I'm tired, that's all. All right! But what's to become of us? Of Alexander? The fact is, what I'm most tired of is the lot of you. Tired of being your nursemaid. Your nursemaid and your warden. Tired of wiping your noses. Victor, are you mad? Pardon. What are you saying? May I smoke? Martha, go away! Go, go, go! Go, go, go! God, Mama, I'm not a child! Call your father to breakfast! - But... - Is it too much to ask? All right, I'll go. Oh, her ways! So calculating. I won't let you go, Victor! I don't know about Mama, but I won't let you go! Something's wrong here and I'm fed up with it. Yes. You can forget about me, and Martha, and the boy... But Alexander is your friend! He'll always be. But he needs you! He has a wife to take care of him. She ought to, anyway. He has a family, a splendid house... - and a son he adores. - Fine and dandy! Julia! Fetch your mistress' jacket! She's cold! So thoughtful! Little Man. Where is he? Look, he's left this note! What's it say? ""My dears: I've slept badly this night. Please don't wake me. Go and take a little walk. The boy will show you his Japanese tree that we planted yesterday. Or was it today? I don't remember, it matters not. I kiss you all. I've taken my pills. Forgive me, even now. June 19, 1985. 10:07 a.m. Papa A."" Shall we take a walk, before the weather changes? ""Forgive me, even now""... What did he mean by that? And why the exact time? Mama, you know how he is. ""How he is..."" I think that ""his"" kindness would be enough to see us all through. But he'll be around longer than that. ""How he is!"" What'd I say wrong? Have you enough kindness left for ""him""? All right, Victor. But why must he be such a child? Maybe I want to be a child as well! We all want something. I, for one, want to go to Australia. Well, gather the ashes. Put them in a glass, fill it with wine, and drink it. - Why? - Don't ask me. Someone said so. If you do, you'll remember this the rest of your life. Come, let's go. Julia, come with us! Fetch the boy and we'll go. I had a dream recently. I was walking the streets, begging. When I woke, I cried and cried. The boy's not there! He's already gone out. I think I know where. To the Japanese tree? He and the boy are just crazy about their Japan. Why just Japan? First it's Australia, then Japan. God, I can't take much more of this! What about this morning? I turned on his music... But he didn't fancy his Japanese. He shut it off. He says he and the boy were Japanese in an earlier life. I wish someone would tell him what to make of this life. Maybe that springs from a deep inner need. Maybe it's easier for him so. Why can't I find an easier way? Can't you? You seem to have all sorts of schemes to that end. But nothing quite so far-fetched as Australia. My God, what is all that nonsense about? Australia! It's absurd! Flowers! I don't understand. What've I done with them? Where are they? Alexander! What's happened? I did it. Don't be upset! Listen to me, Victor. I've got something very impor- No! Silence! Say nothing! Ask nothing! Come, Alexander! You can't stay here! Come, now. Let him be! What are you doing to him? Don't touch him! See you, Alexander! In the beginning was the Word. Why is that, Papa?"
Tarkovsky,Solaris,"Kris, come here! You're just in time. He takes a walk every morning for at least an hour. I forbade him to come back earlier. He's had a lot of work, sometimes staying up all night. These Solarists! He reminds me of a bookkeeper, preparing his accounts. We expected you yesterday. He wanted to run away when he saw me. Hello. Hello. I probably shouldn't have bothered you today. How old you and I have become. I've only just realized that. What are you apologizing for? Does he understand that everything depends on his first report from the station? Everything we've received so far has been confusing or incomprehensible. If he confirms that the work can't continue for some reason, the station can be taken out of Solaris' orbit. He understands. You promised to talk to him. I brought the film. That's what I came here for. - Yes, of course. Can the boy stay with you for a few days? I have a lot to do and no one to leave him with. Anna will look after him. She'll have more free time now. When does he leave? He'll be gone by tomorrow morning. It's so pleasant here. This house reminds me of my grandfather's house. I really liked it. So we decided to build one just like it. I don't like innovation. I'd better get going. I have a lot to do. Don't you want to see this? I've already seen it many times. On the 21st day of our expedition, radiobiologist Vishyakov and physicist Fekhner went on an exploratory flight over the Solaris Ocean in a hydroplane. When they failed to return after 16 hours, we declared an emergency. The fog was thick and we were forced to call the search off. All of the rescue craft returned to the station except for the helicopter operated by Burton. Burton returned an hour after dark. Once out of the helicopter, he ran to his quarters. He was in a state of shock. This was highly unusual for a man with 11 years of experience flying in space. He recovered in a couple of days, but he would never leave the station and refused to approach the window overlooking the Ocean. Later he wrote to us from the clinic. He was preparing a statement of great importance, one that would decide the fate of Solaristics. Excellent. Let's hear what he has to say. At this time, let us give the floor to Burton. Thank you. When I first descended below 300 meters, I had trouble maintaining altitude. There was a strong wind. All of my attention went towards operating the ship. I did not look out of the cabin. As a result, I wound up in a fog. - Was it an ordinary fog? Of course not. It seemed to be colloidal and viscous. It coated all of the windows. Because of the fog's resistance, I began to lose altitude. I couldn't see the sun, but the fog glowed red in its direction. After half an hour I came out into a large, open space. It was almost round, a few hundred meters across. At that point, I noticed a change in the Ocean. The waves disappeared. The surface became almost transparent, with clouded patches. Yellow sludge gathered beneath it. It rose up in thin strips and sparkled like glass. Then it began to seethe, boil and harden. It looked like molasses. This sludge or slime gathered into large lumps and slowly formed different shapes. I was being drawn into the fog, so I had to struggle against this for some time. When I looked down again, I saw a sort of garden. A garden? Attention, please. I saw shrubs, hedges, acacia trees, little paths. Everything was made of the same substance. Did these trees and plants have leaves? These shrubs and acacias? No, I already said they were all made of plaster, but life-sized. Then everything began to crack and break. Yellow sludge poured out of the fissures. Everything began to boil even harder, and foam appeared. You can see for yourselves. I used a camera from time to time. Everything I saw before and after should be on film. Then I propose we interrupt these discussions and see everything with our own eyes. All right, show us your film. This is very interesting. Is that it? That's all of your film? Yes, that's everything. But we don't understand. You filmed clouds. Why did you film clouds? That must be the fog I told you about. I wasn't expecting this. All of this could be the result of Solaris' biomagnetic current acting on Burton's consciousness. We now know the current is not only a gigantic cerebral system, but a substance capable of thought processes. That hypothesis is questionable. Were you feeling sick that day? The next part is meaningless. Let's pick up here. I discovered something floating in one of the openings. It looked like Fechner's space suit. Its shape was that of a person. I turned around – I didn't want to lose sight of that spot. At that moment, the figure rose slightly, as if it were swimming or treading the waves. This person had no space suit, and he was moving. I don't understand. ""Person""? Yes, person. Just a minute. Did you see his face? Yes. What person? Who was it? It was a child. What child? Had you seen him before? No, never. In any case, not that I remember. When I flew closer to him, I noticed something awful. What do you mean? I couldn't make it out at first. Then I saw that he was unusually large. Gigantic. He was about four meters tall. He had blue eyes and dark hair. Perhaps you're not feeling well? We'll postpone the meeting. I'll continue. He was naked, absolutely naked, like a newborn. He was wet, or rather, slippery. His skin was shiny. He rose and fell like the waves, but he was moving by himself. It was disgusting. I'm sorry. I'll jump ahead a little. There isn't much more. Burton's statements appear to be the result of a hallucinatory complex brought on by the planet's atmosphere, as well as symptoms of depression exacerbated by inflammation of the associative zone of the cerebral cortex. This report in no way, or in almost no way, corresponds with reality. What do you mean ""almost""? Excuse me, I'm not finished yet. Professor Messenger offers a different opinion. He believes that Burton's statements could be founded in reality and merit further study. That's it. I saw it all with my own eyes. I would like to offer another opinion. We stand on the brink of an enormous discovery, Our decision should not rely on the observations of a man without any scientific qualifications. Although any researcher may envy this pilot, his presence of mind, his gift of observation. Moreover, in light of recent information, we are morally obligated to continue the exploration. I can understand how Professor Messenger feels. I understand him. But let's take a look at the road we've traveled. Solaristics is exactly where it began. Years of work have been in vain. Everything we now know about Solaris is negative and has come to resemble a mountain of disjointed, incoherent facts that strain credulity. We're in exactly the same situation today. Solaristics is degenerating. But what we're talking about is far more serious than just the study of Solaristics. We're talking about the boundaries of human knowledge. Don't you think that by establishing artificial barriers we deliver a blow to the idea of limitless thought? By limiting our movement forward, we facilitate moving backwards. I nevertheless repeat my question. What do you mean by saying the report of my observations in almost no way corresponds with reality? I saw everything with my own eyes. What do you mean by ""almost""? ""Almost no way"" means that some real phenomena could have triggered your hallucinations, Burton. When it's windy, it's easy to confuse a swaying bush with a living being, to say nothing of a foreign planet. I meant no offense, Burton. None. I'd like to know what impact Professor Messenger's opinion will have. Practically none, which means that exploration in this area will be discontinued. Just a moment. Yes... I'd like to make a statement. The commission has not offended me, but it has offended the spirit of the expedition. Therefore, I consider it my duty to announce... And so on... Nowadays it's considered good manners to laugh when Burton's report is mentioned. Thank you, Burton. We've known you for a long time, but I never knew anything about you. You know, you were very handsome. That's not true, but thanks anyway. Excuse me. Well, Kris, what do you think? If you don't mind, I'd like to speak to your son alone. I don't want to look like an idiot in front of you yet again. I'll wait for you outside by the swing. What a ridiculous man. You have no reason to say that. He's ill at ease. He thinks he's getting in the way of our farewell. He's a tactful man. If he decided to come, it's because he considers this important. Although, I admit, I'd rather not see anyone now. You and I rarely get a chance to talk. I'm glad to hear you say that. Even if it's on the last day. The last day. One always feels awful after a big farewell. Here comes your aunt. Let's meet after lunch. We need to talk. Why did you have to invite this Burton today of all days? Where are the guests going to sleep? Next to you, or in the room upstairs? Upstairs, I guess. Well, I'm off to my meeting by the swing. - Maybe... - Just a moment. You and your rooms can wait! Listen, Kris... What happened? - What's standing over there? - What are you afraid of? In the garage, staring at me. It's a horse. Don't. I've seen it already. Come on. He's gentle. Look how beautiful he is. You understand, I think Solaristics has reached an impasse as a result of irresponsible daydreaming. I'm interested in the truth, but you want to turn me into a biased supporter. I don't have the right to make decisions based on impulses of the heart. I'm not a poet. I have a concrete goal: Either stop the research and remove the station from orbit, thereby legitimizing the Solaristics crisis, or take extreme measures. Perhaps bombard the Ocean with heavy radiation. - Not that! - Why not? Didn't you say research should continue at any price? You want to destroy that which we are presently incapable of understanding? Forgive me, but I am not an advocate of knowledge at any price. Knowledge is only valid when it's based on morality. Man is the one who renders science moral or immoral. Remember Hiroshima. Then don't make science immoral. It's strange... Strange. There's nothing strange about it. You yourself can't be sure that what you saw wasn't just hallucinations. Thank you very much. It's seems there's nothing more to discuss. - What happened? - I'm leaving. Where are you going? He's an accountant, not a scientist. You were right. You and I are friends, but that doesn't mean you can say that about him. Great. You and I have known each other for 20 years. It had to end someday. Are you leaving the boy? What did you have to offend him for? You're too harsh. It's dangerous to send people like you into space. Everything there is too fragile. Yes, fragile! The Earth has somehow become adjusted to people like you, although at what sacrifice! What, are you jealous that he'll be the one to bury me, and not you? Thus, it had been established that the Solaris Ocean is a distinctive brain. Right after that, an even more daring hypothesis came out, suggesting that the Ocean is a thinking substance. Incidentally, this hypothesis still cannot be confirmed or refuted. It's a program about Solaris. There are few believers left. First of all, there are those connected to the fate of the Solaris station. On this huge station built to house 85people there is now a crew of three. They are: astrobiologist Sartorius, cyberneticist Snaut, and physiologist Gibarian, who deal with the problem... I'm calling from the city. Burton. Anna, leave for a minute. We need to talk. I didn't talk to Kris about what was most important: about Messenger, who voiced a different opinion at that meeting. He became very interested in Fechner, who died in the Solaris Ocean. It turns out that Fechner has an orphaned son. He had left his family. Messenger and I paid a visit to Fechner's widow, and I saw this boy with my own eyes. You never told me about that. I never got the chance. Fine. Go on. This child was identical to the one I saw on Solaris. Of course, he wasn't four meters tall. He shouldn't think about this too much before liftoff, but he should keep it in mind. There's no point in keeping these papers. The ones to hold on to are in my room. My research notes, my thesis... I held on to so much. If something should happen, I'll find someone to take care of them. I'll come up with something. Don't look for that film. I'm taking it with me. Remember? The one of the bonfire? Yes, of course. - Ready, Kelvin? - Ready, Moddard. Don't worry about a thing. Have a great trip. Send our regards. - When is liftoff? - You're already flying, Kris! Take care. Solaris station! Do something! I'm losing stability. This is Kelvin, over. Hey, where is everyone? You've got guests. Dr. Snaut? Snaut? I'm Kelvin, the psychologist. It looks like you weren't expecting me. Did you receive the radiogram? Yes, of course. What's with you? Forgive me. Where's Gibarian? Where's Sartorius? Sartorius is in his quarters. Gibarian is dead. What do you mean ""dead""? Suicide. I beg your pardon. I knew Gibarian and he would never have... He was almost always in a state of deep depression ever since these disturbances began... Why don't you go rest, take a bath? Take any room and come back in an hour. I would like to see Gibarian – I mean, Sartorius. Later. I doubt he'd see you now. He's upstairs, in the laboratory. Listen, Snaut, I understand that something extraordinary has happened and maybe... Dr. Kelvin... You understand... Come back in an hour. Please. Go and rest. Listen, there are only three of us: you, me and Sartorius. You know us from our photographs. If you see something out of the ordinary, something besides me and Sartorius, try not to lose your head. What would I see? I don't know. That sort of depends on you. Hallucinations? No. Just remember. - Remember what? - That we're not on Earth. You know, it would be better if you came back in the evening, or at night. No, let's make it tomorrow morning. A. GIBARIAN HUMAN BEING FOR K. KELVIN Hi, Kris. I still have a little time left. There are some things I must tell you, and some things I must warn you about. By now you're at the station and know what happened to me. If not, Snaut or Sartorius will tell you. What happened to me... is not important. Or rather, it cannot be explained. I'm afraid that what happened to me is only the beginning. I wouldn't, of course, want it to happen... but this could happen to you and the others. Here, it could probably happen to anyone. Just don't think that I've lost my mind. I'm of sound mind, Kris. Believe me. After all, you know me. If I have enough time, I'll tell you why I did everything. I'm telling you this so that, if it does happen to you, you'll know it's not madness. That's the most important thing. As for continuing research, I'm leaning towards Sartorius' proposal, subjecting the Ocean's plasma to heavy radiation. I know it's prohibited, but there's no other choice. We... You will get mired in it. It may offer a way of breaking this deadlock. This is our only chance to make contact with this monster. There is no other choice, Kris. If... Dr. Sartorius, I am Kelvin. I arrived two hours ago. Listen, this is ridiculous. Either open up or I'll break down the door. All right, I'll open the door, but don't come in. I'll come out. - Fine. My name is Kelvin. Go on. You must have heard of me. I work, or worked, with Gibarian. Go on. Snaut told me about Gibarian. Then you already know the story. Yes, it's horrible. I don't know the details, but he's dead. That's not the problem. We all die. But he insisted on being buried on Earth. Is space really such a bad grave for him? But Gibarian wanted to be in the ground, with the worms. I wanted to disregard it, but Snaut insisted. - Have you ever heard of Burton? - He was the pilot who... Yes, he was in the search party for Fechner. Fechner died a magnificent death, but Gibarian was a coward. There's no point talking badly of him now. It's at least worth talking about duty. Duty to whom? - To truth. - You mean to people. You won't find truth there. Look. Your position is absurd. Your so-called courage is inhuman! You hear me? Go away. You're too impressionable. You must get used to everything. Good day. I spoke to Sartorius. He's a rotten person. He's a very talented scientist. I think I'm a little sick. There's nothing wrong with you. You just won't take advice. Snaut, aside from the three of us, is there anyone else on the station? Did you see someone? What were you warning me about? Whom did you see? Was it a human being? Is she real? Can she be touched? Wounded? You saw her today. And you? Who the hell are you? Quiet. - Where did she come from? - Leave me alone. You're afraid. Don't worry. I won't think you're insane. Insane? God, you know absolutely nothing! Insane... That would be a blessing. Listen, Snaut... It's all so senseless. They won't understand me. They think I've gone crazy. Do you see, Kris, how it's not entirely absurd? I have to do this because I'm afraid they'll come in here. I mean Snaut and Sartorius. They themselves don't understand what they're doing. I'm afraid, Kris... I can't... Nobody will be able to understand. Open up! You hear, Gibarian? Open up! Don't be stupid. It's just us – Snaut and Sartorius. We want to help you. They want to help me. Just a second. Quit knocking. I am my own judge. Have you seen her? Kris, understand that this is not madness. It has something to do with conscience. I really wanted you to get here in time, Kris. Where did you...? It's so nice. But... but it's not... How did you know where I...? What do you mean, ""how""? Don't, Kris. That tickles. Where are my shoes? - Shoes? No. They're not there. Who's this? Kris... it's me. You know... I have the feeling... as if I've forgotten something. I can't understand it. Do you love me? Don't be silly, Hari. As if you didn't know. I'm going out for a moment. Wait for me, okay? - I'll go with you. - No, Hari. I'll be back soon. No. What's with you? Why? I don't know. I can't. You can't what? It feels like I... I have to see you... all the time. What are you, a child? I have work to do, Hari. I'm behaving foolishly. And so are you. Running around all disheveled, like Snaut. - Like who? - Like Snaut. Listen, how do you... Well, I have to go. If you want, we can go together. But you won't be able to get into a suit with your dress on. Get undressed. Kris, help me. I can't undo it. Why are you looking at me like that? SOLARIS Part Two Get in. - What about you? - I'm right behind you. I have to shut the hatch. Is everything all right? Are you comfortable? Yes. Hurry, Kris. You could at least knock. It sounded like you were talking to someone. All the more reason. So you had guests? Well, I see you took good care of them. It's nothing. You won't die from it. Did you at least start out modestly? Narcotics, poisons, barbiturates, eh? If you plan to clown around, you might as well leave. Sometimes you become a clown without wanting to. Don't tell me you haven't tried a rope or a hammer. Did you happen to throw the inkwell like Luther? No? So, one, two, and into the rocket, and that was that. Next time, don't panic. And push the button from the corridor. You could get burned. - What was that? - I don't know. Then again, we've managed to determine a few things. Who was it? She died 10 years ago. What you saw was the materialization of your conception of her. What was her name? - Hari. Everything began after we started experimenting with radiation. We hit the Ocean's surface with strong X-ray beams. But it... Incidentally, consider yourself lucky. After all, she's a part of your past. What if it had been something you had never seen before, but something you had thought or imagined? I don't understand. Evidently the Ocean responded to our heavy radiation with something else. It probed our minds and extracted something like islands of memory. Will she come back? She will... and she won't. - Hari the Second. - There may be an endless number of them. Why didn't you warn me? You wouldn't have believed me. I got scared and acted not entirely... Don't be hard on yourself. We've had enough of Gibarian. There's talk about liquidating the station. That's why I was sent here. If I submit a report, will you sign it? And what if we suddenly make that long-awaited contact? Night is the best time here. It somehow reminds me of Earth. Attach strips of paper to the air vents. At night it sounds like the rustling of leaves. It was Gibarian's invention. So simple, like all genius. I adopted it right away. Sartorius made fun of us, but he has one in his room. He hides it in the closet. You should rest. If you can, come to the library later. I've prepared a list of books for you. Snaut, is that you? Kris, where are you? Come here. - It's so dark. - Come here. Don't be afraid. Hari! The door opens the other way. Kris. Hari ! Hari! Hang on. I'll be right back. When I saw you weren't there, I got scared. Hello, Kris. Yeah. I can barely hear you. Speak louder. What are you doing right now? Nothing. Sartorius has invited us to his laboratory. How are you? Fine. I'll try to make it. Kris, what's wrong with me? Maybe it's epilepsy? This is my wife. Hello. Hello. - We've been waiting for you. - I was busy. - How lovely! Are these yours? - No, they're Snaut's. So, as far as I can tell, they are constructed... Let's just call them ""guests."" Fine. While our structure is made of atoms, theirs consists of neutrinos. But neutrino systems are unstable. They seem to be stabilized by Solaris' force field. You've got a superb specimen. That's my wife. Wonderful. Perfect. Then take a blood sample from your wife. Why? It'll sober you up a bit. What do you think? - Snaut? - Enough of all of you! I burned the blood with acid, but it's restoring itself. Regeneration? In essence, immortality – Faust's problem. Excuse me. There's no need for cotton. Are you qualified to perform an autopsy? I've already told you – she's my wife. Don't you understand? I think these experiments are more humane than testing on rabbits. Don't you agree? It doesn't matter. It would be like cutting my own leg off. Did you feel pain when you broke through the door? Pain? Of course. So if I ever catch you doing anything... - You're lucky. - How so? It's meaningless, yet you've managed to establish emotional contact with them. It may be pleasant... - What are you, jealous? Maybe I'm jealous. No, you're not jealous. After all, you're not guilty of anything. - Of course. - But I am guilty. Of what? When you turn into an utter cripple with no arms or legs, call us. We'll empty your chamber pot. - But whom have you wronged? - You, among others. My father shot that. Well, I shot a bit. Listen... I don't know myself at all. I don't remember. When I close my eyes, I can't recall my face. And you? What? - Do you know yourself? - Like all humans. That woman in the white coat hated me. Don't make things up. She died before you and I met. I don't understand why you're deceiving me. I remember perfectly. We drank tea and she kicked me out. Naturally, I stood up and left. I remember perfectly. What happened after that? After that, I went away, and we never saw each other again. Where did you go? To a different city. - Why? - I was transferred. Why did you leave without me? You didn't want to come. That I remember. Forgive me. I thought you were already awake. What happened? The regeneration is slowing down. For two or three hours we can be free of them. You came in the middle of the night to tell me that? I'll tell you why I came. Sartorius and I were thinking: If the Ocean derives guests from us while we dream, maybe it makes sense to transmit our waking thoughts to it. - How? - With beams of radiation. Perhaps it will understand and spare us from all these apparitions. Again these ridiculous X-ray sermons about the greatness of science? We'll modulate the beam with the brain waves of one of us. And ""one of us"" means me, of course. An encephalogram! A transcription of all my thoughts! What if I suddenly want her to die? To disappear! Entrust everything to that... that mass of jelly? It's already invaded my soul. Kris, we're running out of time. Sartorius has proposed another project: the annihilator. Self-destruction of the neutrino systems. What is this? Blackmail? I convinced him to start with the encephalogram. But forget about this for now. Tomorrow's my birthday. Consider yourself invited. - Liar! You just want to make up with us. - Yes, I do. Don't shout. She sleeping. Sleeping? She's already learned how to sleep? This will all end badly. - Well, what do you propose I do? - Nothing. So you'll come? Tomorrow, in the library. We'll set the table. At least there are no windows in there. In the meantime, let's go. Sartorius is waiting. She's sleeping. Will she follow me? Don't lock the door. What door? It's just an apparition. Wait. I'll be right back. Where are you going? Forgive me. Why aren't you asleep? - You don't love me. - Stop it, Hari. - We have to talk. - About what? You understand that I don't know where I came from. Maybe you know? - What's with you? Stop. Don't interrupt. If you know, but you can't tell me now, perhaps one day you will. What are you talking about? I don't understand a thing, honestly. You don't want to tell me. You're afraid. Then I'll tell you. I'm not Hari. Hari is dead. She poisoned herself. I'm somebody else. Who told you this? - Sartorius just told me. - Last night. It would have been better if you had told me yourself. My God, what's the difference? How have you lived all this time? Were you in love with anyone? I don't know. Did you ever think of me? Yes, but not all the time. Only when I felt unhappy. You know, it feels like somebody is tricking us. And the longer this fog lasts, the worse it will be for you in the end. Particularly for you, Kris. How can I help you? Tell me. And her, the other one, what happened to her? We argued. Towards the end, we argued a lot. I gathered my things and left. She made me understand without saying it directly, but when you live with someone for a long time, such things aren't necessary. I was sure they were just words, but then I remembered that I'd left the laboratory specimens in the refrigerator. I had brought them from the laboratory and explained how they worked. I got scared. I wanted to go to her. But then I thought it would look like I had taken her words seriously. After three days, I couldn't take it anymore and I went to see her. When I got there, she was already dead. There was a needle mark on her arm. Like this? Why did she do it? She probably sensed that I didn't really love her. But now I do. - Kris. - What? I love you. Get some sleep. I don't know how to sleep. It's not sleep. It's somehow around me. It's as if it weren't just inside of me, but much farther away. It's probably still sleep. So, it looks like our guest of honor isn't showing up. - Why? - Maybe he has guests. Oh, everyone's already here? You're an hour and a half late. What's that you're reading? It's all rubbish. Rubbish. Where the hell is... Here! ""They come at night. But one must sleep sometime."" That's the problem. Mankind has lost the ability to sleep. You'd better read. I'm a little excited. ""I know only one thing, señor. When I... When I sleep, I know no fear, no hope, no trouble, no bliss. Blessings on him who invented sleep. The common coin that purchases all things, the balance that levels shepherd and king, fool and wise man. There is only one bad thing about sound sleep. They say it closely resembles death."" ""Never before, Sancho, have I heard you speak so elegantly as now."" That's great, but perhaps you'll let me say something now? I propose a toast to Snaut, to his bravery, to his devotion to duty. To science and to Snaut. Science? Nonsense. In this situation, mediocrity and genius are equally useless. We have no interest in conquering any cosmos. We want to extend the Earth to the borders of the cosmos. We don't know what to do with other worlds. We don't need other worlds. We need a mirror. We struggle for contact, but we'll never find it. We're in the foolish human predicament of striving for a goal that he fears, that he has no need for. Man needs man. Let's drink to Gibarian. To his memory. Even though he got frightened. No, Gibarian was not frightened. There are worse things. He died of hopelessness. He thought all this was happening only to him. My God! All these heartbreaking lamentations are nothing but second-rate Dostoyevsky. Who are you to judge? I know why I'm here. I'm working. Man was created by nature so he could learn her ways. In his endless search for the truth, man is condemned to knowledge. Everything else is whim. Permit me to ask, my esteemed colleague: Why have you come to Solaris? - What do you mean, why? - Well, are you working a lot? Forgive me, but aside from the romance with your ex-wife, nothing seems to interest you. You spend all day lounging in a bed of noble thoughts, and that's how you carry out your duty. You've lost touch with reality. Forgive me, but you're simply a loafer. Enough! Let's try to be pleasant. We'll drink to Gibarian. Not to Gibarian, but to Man. Are you saying Gibarian was not a man? Stop it, Kris. Let's not fight. After all, it's my birthday. It's my day. Of course. I think that Kris Kelvin is more consistent than both of you. In inhuman conditions, he has behaved humanely. And you act as if none of this concerns you, and consider your guests – it seems that's what you call us – something external, a hindrance. But it's a part of you. It's your conscience. And Kris loves me. Maybe it's not me he loves, but he's simply protecting himself. He wants me alive. That's not the point. It doesn't matter why man loves. It's different for everyone. It's not Kris. It's you. I hate you all. - I would ask you... Please don't interrupt me. I'm a woman, after all. You're not a woman and you're not a human being. Understand that, if you're capable of understanding anything. There is no Hari. She's dead. You're just a reproduction, a mechanical reproduction. A copy. A matrix. Yes. Maybe. But I... I am becoming a human being. I can feel just as deeply as you. Believe me. I can already get by without him. I... love him. I am a human being. You... you're very cruel. Get up! Get up right now! My dear man. Nothing could be easier. We've wasted time arguing. We're losing our dignity and human character. No. You're human, each in your own way. That's why you argue. I hope I'm not bothering you. You're a good man... but you look awful. I've really lost heart. Help me out a bit. Doesn't a man who's ready to give up his life just to make cursed contact in order to know more about it have the right to get drunk? He has every right. Do you believe in our mission, Kelvin? I'm not going to bed yet. It's important not to fall asleep. I'm going to see Faust. In the laboratory, our Faust – Sartorius – is seeking a remedy for immortality. While we... Listen, let's open these hatches and shout down below. It would suddenly hear. But what should we call it? Maybe we should whip it. Or, better yet, pray to it. What's wrong? I think I shut the door to the library. She's there alone. Go. I feel better already. The station is changing its orbit. At 5 a.m. there will be 30 seconds of weightlessness. Don't forget. Hari. Hari. Forgive me, my darling. I was lost in thought. Is something wrong? No, nothing. Everything's fine. She drank liquid oxygen. She did it out of despair. It'll get worse. The more she's with you, the more human she'll become. Learn from Sartorius' example. - Thanks for the advice. What do you intend to do? Wait until she returns. And then what? Leave the station? Kris, she can only live here, on the station. You know that. What can I do? I love her. - Which one? Her, or the one in the rocket? You can pull her in from space. She will appear again and she'll keep appearing. Don't turn a scientific problem into a common love story. I had a feeling this would end badly. You should help her. What a ghastly sight. I can never get used to all these resurrections. Is it me? Hari... What? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? No, it's not me. It's... I'm... not Hari... And you... Maybe you... - Don't, Hari. - I'm not Hari! Fine! Maybe your appearance is supposed to be torture. Maybe it's a favor from the Ocean. What does it matter when you're worth more to me than any science could ever be? Do I look a lot like her? No, you looked like her. But now you – and not her – are the real Hari. Tell me... Tell me... Do I disgust you? I'm so... I disgust you! - No, Hari. That's not true. - You're lying! - It's not true. Stop it. - I must be disgusting! - Stop it. No. Don't touch me! I love you. What's the matter? Nothing. I'm not going back to Earth. I'll live here with you on the station. You know... I'm afraid. It looks like it's showing some activity. Your encephalogram helped. You know... whenever we show pity, we ravage ourselves. Maybe it's true... Suffering makes life seem dismal and suspect. But I won't accept that. No, I won't accept that. Is that which is indispensable to life also harmful to it? No, it's not harmful. Of course it's not harmful. Remember Tolstoy? His suffering over the impossibility of loving mankind as a whole? How much time has passed since then? Somehow I can't figure it out. Help me. See, I love you. But love is a feeling we can experience but never explain. One can explain the concept. You love that which you can lose: Yourself, a woman, a homeland. Until today, love was simply unattainable to mankind, to the Earth. Do you understand me, Snaut? There are so few of us. A few billion altogether. A handful! Maybe we're here in order to experience people as a reason for love. He seems to have a fever. How did Gibarian die? You still haven't told me. I'll tell you. Later. Gibarian didn't die of fear. He died of shame. Shame – the feeling that will save mankind. Mama, I... I'm two hours late. I know. How was your trip? Fine. I'm a little tired, but it was fine. My God, it's running slow again. - I'll go adjust it. - You've got plenty of time. You know, it's really embarrassing, but for some reason... I've completely forgotten your face. You don't look well. Are you happy? Somehow that concept seems irrelevant here. That's really a pity. I'm very lonesome now. Why do you hurt our feelings? What have you been waiting for? Why haven't you called? You're leading some sort of strange life. You're filthy and unkempt. How did you make such a mess of yourself? What's this? Wait here. I'll be right back. Mama... Hari... Hari... How are you? Everything all right? Where's Hari? What's that? There's no more Hari. ""Kris, it's terrible that I had to deceive you, but there was no other way. This is best for both of us. I asked them myself. You mustn't blame anyone. Hari."" She did it for you. Snaut, listen. Later, Kris. Calm down. How... how did it... The annihilator? A burst of light and wind. Yes. Things weren't working out between us towards the end. Listen, Snaut. Why are we being tortured like this? In my opinion, we have lost our sense of the cosmic. The ancients understood it perfectly. They never would have asked why or what for. Remember the myth of Sisyphus. Since we transmitted your encephalogram, none of the guests have come back. Something incomprehensible is starting to take place in the Ocean. Islands have begun to form on the surface. First one. Then the next day there were several more. Are you trying to tell me that it understood us? That quickly? But at least there's hope, eh, Kris? - How old are you? - Fifty-two. Why? Have you been here long? - You must have seen my forms. - I did. Listen, having spent so many years here on the station, do you still feel a clear connection to your life down there? You like dire questions. Soon you'll ask me about the meaning of life. Wait. Don't be ironic. It's a banal question. When man is happy, the meaning of life and other eternal themes rarely interest him. These questions should be asked at the end of one's life. But we don't know when life will end. That's why we're in such a hurry. Don't rush. The happiest people are those who are not interested in these cursed questions. To ask is always the desire to know. Yet the preservation of simple human truths requires mystery. The mysteries of happiness, death and love. Maybe you're right, but try not to think about all that now. To think about it is to know the day of one's death. Not knowing that day makes us practically immortal. Fine, then. In any event, my mission is finished. But what next? Return to Earth? Little by little, everything will return to normal. I'll even find new interests and acquaintances. But I won't be able to give myself to them fully. Never. Do I have the right to turn down even an imagined possibility of contact with this Ocean which my race has been trying to understand for decades? Should I remain here? Among things and objects we both touched? Which still bear the memory of our breath? What for? In the hope that she'll return? But I don't harbor this hope. The only thing left for me is to wait. I don't know what for. New miracles? Are you tired? No, I feel great. You know, Kris... I think it's time you returned to Earth. You think so?"
Tarkovsky,Stalker,"""Was it a meteorite or a visitation from outer space? Whatever it was, in our small country, there appeared a miracle — the Zone. We sent in troops. Not one returned. Then we surrounded the Zone with a security cordon. We did right... Although I'm not sure. I'm not sure."" From an interview with Nobel Prize winner Professor Wallace to an RAI correspondent. Why did you take my watch? Where are you going? You gave me your word. I believed you. You won't think of yourself. But what about us? Think about your daughter. She's not even used to you yet, and you're going back to your old ways. You've turned me into an old hag, ruined my life. Quiet. You'll wake up Monkey. I can't spend my life waiting for you. I'll die. You were going to get proper work. They promised you a decent, normal job. I'll be back soon. You'll be back in prison. Next time, they'll give you ten years instead of five. And you'll have nothing to show for those ten years. Not the Zone, not anything. And in ten years, I'll be dead. ""Prison""? I'm imprisoned everywhere. Let me go. - I won't let you go. - Let me go. - I won't! Go on, then! And may you rot there! I curse the day I met you, you scum! God cursed you by sending you that child. And he cursed me because of you. You bastard! My dear, the world is so unutterably boring. There's no telepathy, no ghosts, no flying saucers. They can't exist. The world is ruled by cast-iron laws. These laws are not broken. They just can't be broken. Don't hope for flying saucers. That would be too interesting. But what about the Bermuda Triangle? You're not going to contradict... - Yes, I am. There is no Bermuda Triangle. There's Triangle ABC, which equals Triangle A prime, B prime, C prime. It's all so tedious, so very tedious. In the Middle Ages, life was interesting. Every house had its goblin, each church had God. People were young. Now every fourth person is old. It's boring, my angel. It's so boring. But you said that the Zone is the product of a super civilization — Which is probably also boring, also with laws and triangles, but without goblins and, of course, without any God. Because if there is a God, he'll be that very triangle. Then I simply don't know. It's for me. Good-bye, dear friend. This fine lady agreed to go with us into the Zone. She's so brave. Her name is — Excuse me, what is your name? Are you really a stalker? I'll explain everything later. Get lost. An idiot. So you've been drinking? I simply had a drink, as does half of all humanity. And the other half also gets drunk, including women and children. I simply had a drink. Damn it! Someone spilled something. Drink. It's still early. How about one for the road? What do you think? - Take it away. - Of course, the prohibition law. ""Alcohol is the scourge of mankind."" Let's drink beer then. Is he coming with us? Don't worry. He'll sober up. He needs to go there, too. - Are you really a professor? - If you wish. In that case, let me introduce myself. My name is — They call him the Writer. And what's my name? You're the professor. Of course. I'm a writer, so naturally everyone calls me the Writer. - What do you write about? - About my readers. No sense in writing about anything else. There's no sense in writing about anything. What are you? A chemist? I'd say a physicist. That's probably tedious, too. Searching for the truth. You dig here and there. Right. The nucleus consists of protons. That's a good dig. Triangle ABC equals Triangle A prime, B prime, C prime. But with me, it's a different matter. I dig for the truth, but, while I do, something happens to it. The truth changes into a pile of — I won't say what. It's just fine for you. Say there's some antique pot in a museum. In its own time, it was a trash bin. But now it draws admiration for its simplicity of line and unique form. And everyone oohs and aahs over it. Suddenly, it turns out not to be an antique at all. It was planted by some joker for a laugh. The sounds of admiration die away. Some connoisseurs! This is what you think about all the time? God forbid. I seldom think. It's bad for me. It's impossible to write and keep thinking about success or failure. Naturlich. But on the other hand, if my books aren't being read in 100 years, why bother to write? Tell me, Professor, why did you get involved in this business? What's the Zone to you? Well, in a sense, I'm a scientist. What's in it for you? A fashionable author... ...women draped all over you. I've lost my inspiration. I'm going to beg for some. So you've exhausted your talent? What? Yes, in a way. Do you hear that? That's our train. Did you take the top off the car? - It's off. Rueger. If I don't come back, tell my wife. Damn! I forgot to buy cigarettes. Don't go back. - What is it? - Well... - You're all like that. - Like what? You believe any superstitious rubbish. I'll have to save these for a rainy day. Are you really a scientist? Get down! Keep still! See if anyone's there. Hurry, for God's sake! There's nobody here. Go to the other door. Get going, Writer. Keep your eyes open. Did you bring the gasoline can? Yes. A full one. What I said about going there... It's all a lie. I don't give a damn about inspiration. But how can I put a name to... ...what it is that I want? How am I to know I don't want what I want or that I really don't want what I don't want? These are intangibles where the moment you name them, their meaning evaporates like jellyfish in the sun. You've seen them around. My consciousness wants the triumph of vegetarianism. My subconscious longs for a juicy steak. So what do I want? I want world supremacy, at the very least. Why do they need a train in the Zone? It won't go beyond the military post. The guards won't venture in there. Everyone in their places? Hurry! Listen. Go and see if there's a railcar there. - What railcar? - Hurry up! Get back. I'll go. The gasoline can. Give it to me. Leave your rucksack. It's in the way. I see you're traveling light. If anyone's hit, don't cry out. If they spot you, they'll kill you. Then when everything's quiet, crawl back to the post. You'll be picked up later. Won't they come after us? No, they're scared to death of it. Of what? Here we are, home at last. It's so still. It's the quietest place on earth. You'll see for yourself. It's so beautiful. There's no one here. We're here. Three men can't foul it up in one day. Why can't we? Sure we can. Strange, the flowers have no scent. Don't you feel it? It stinks like a swamp. No, that's the river. There used to be flower beds here, but Porcupine trampled on them. But their scent lingered on for many years. Why did he wipe them out? I don't know. I asked him why. He said, ""One day, you'll understand."" I think he simply began to hate the Zone. Is Porcupine his real name? No, a nickname. Like yours. For years he brought people into the Zone, and nobody could stop him. He was my teacher. He opened my eyes. They didn't call him Porcupine then, but Teacher. Then something happened to him. Something broke inside him. I think he was being punished. Help me. Tie the bandage strips to these metal nuts. I'll just take a walk. I need... Be careful when you walk here. Where did he go? Perhaps he just wants to be alone. Why? Even with three of us here, I feel uneasy. He's back in the Zone. Remember, he's a stalker. What of it? You see, stalking is a kind of vocation. - I imagined stalkers to be different. - How so? Like Leatherstocking or Chingachgook or Big Snake. Our stalker's biography is more terrifying. He was in prison several times, and he was crippled here. His daughter is a mutant, a so-called Zone victim. They say she has no legs. What did he mean about the Porcupine? What did he mean he was punished? What is that, a figure of speech? One fine day, Porcupine returned from this place and suddenly became rich. Incredibly rich. You call that a punishment? Within a week, he had hanged himself. - Why? - Quiet! What is it? About 20 years ago, they say a meteorite fell here. It razed the settlement. They searched for it, but they found nothing, of course. Why ""of course""? Then people began to vanish. Finally, it was decided — - Well? Finally, it was decided that this meteorite was not quite a meteorite. So, for a start... ...they put up barbed wire to stop the inquisitive taking risks. Then rumors began that somewhere in the Zone there's a place... ...where desires come true. Well, naturally, they started to guard the Zone like a treasure. For who knows what desires a person might have? What was it if it wasn't a meteorite? Nobody knows. But what do you think it was? I don't have any idea. It could have been anything. A message to mankind, as a colleague of mine says. Or a gift. Some gift. Why would they want to do that? To make us happy. The flowers are blooming again, but they've no scent. Forgive me for leaving you here, but it was too early to go on. Did you hear that? - Maybe there are people living here. - Who? You told me the story yourself. Those travelers who were here when the Zone appeared. There's no one in the Zone. There can't be. Are we ready to start? How do we get back? - Nobody finds their way back from here. - What do you mean? We'll proceed as agreed. Each time, I'll point out the path. It's dangerous to veer from it. Keep the last pole in sight. You go first, Professor. Now you. Try to follow in his tracks. Lord! Where's — Did they remain here, the people? Nobody knows. I only recall them leaving from our station to come here to the Zone. I was still a kid then. Everyone thought someone wanted to conquer us. Go on, Professor. Now you, Writer. The Room is over there. We go this way. Are you trying to make it seem hard? You can almost wrap your arms around it. Yes, but you need very long arms. We don't have it. Leave it! Don't — Don't touch it! I said don't touch it! What, are you crazy? What was that for? I said this wasn't the place for a stroll. The Zone demands respect, otherwise it'll punish you. Don't try anything like that again. Has the cat got your tongue? - I asked you not to. - Do we go this way? Yes. To the left. But we don't go in a direct line. We'll go roundabout. Why? Here, the straight path isn't shortest. The more indirect, the less risk there is. Is it fatal to go straight ahead? - I told you. It's dangerous. - Is the detour less dangerous? It's not, but nobody goes straight... You and your detours! How about if I just go straight? - Listen. You — Why can't we go straight ahead? It's right under our noses. It's risky here, risky there. What the hell. You know your attitude about this is very irresponsible. I'm fed up with your nuts and bandages. Forget it. I'm going this way. - The man's crazy. - And I return the compliment. May I? The wind is rising. Do you feel it? The grass... Okay, all the more reason. What do you mean? - Hold it. - Take your hands off me. All right. Then let the professor be my witness. I'm didn't send you in there. You're going of your own free will. Of my own free will. What else? Nothing. Go on. And hope to God you're lucky. Listen! If you suddenly notice something or feel something strange, turn right back. Just don't throw a lump of iron at my head. Stop! Don't move! - Why did you do that? - Do what? Why did you stop him? I thought you did. What happened? Why did you stop me? - I didn't stop you. - Who did then? You? What the hell. You're a fine one, Mr. Shakespeare. Afraid to advance, ashamed to retreat. So you order yourself to stop in a false voice. Fear's sobered you up. - What? - Shut up. - Why'd you empty my bottle? - I demand discipline! The Zone is... ...a very complex maze of traps. All of them are death traps. I don't know what happens here when humans aren't around. But as soon as humans appear, everything begins to change. Former traps disappear, new ones appear. Safe ways become impassable. The way becomes now easy, now confused beyond words. This is the Zone. It might seem capricious. But at each moment, it's as if we construct it according to our state of mind. I won't hide the fact that some people turned back half-way. Some perished on the threshold of the Room. But everything that happens here depends on us. So the Zone lets the good through and kills the evil? I don't know. I don't believe that. I think it lets through those who've lost all hope. Not the good or the bad, but the unhappy. But even the most unhappy will perish if they don't know how to behave here. You're lucky. The Zone warned you. If you don't mind, I'll wait here till you come back. You'll return happy men. - That's impossible. - Believe me. I've got sandwiches and a thermos. - First, you won't survive an hour. - And second? What's more, nobody returns the same way. All the same, I'd prefer it. Then we'll go back immediately. I'll refund your money minus a small sum for my trouble. Sobered up, Professor? All right. Toss the metal nut. Part Two STALKER Where are you? Come here! Are you tired? Oh, Lord. Judging by his tone of voice, he'll lecture us again. May everything come true. May they believe. And may they laugh at their own passions. For what they call passion is not really the energy of the soul, but merely friction between the soul and the outside world. But, above all, may they believe in themselves and become as helpless as children. For softness is great and strength is worthless. When a man is born, he is soft and pliable. When he dies, he is strong and hard. When a tree grows, it is soft and pliable. But when it is dry and hard, it dies. Hardness and strength are death's companions. Flexibility and softness are the embodiment of life. That which has become hard shall not triumph. Come here. It will fit very well. Soon we'll reach the dry tunnel. Careful. Don't jinx us. - Are we already on our way? - Of course. Why? I thought you only wanted to show us something. What about my rucksack? - What happened to it? I left it back there. I didn't know we were going. - It can't be helped. - Why not? I've got to go back. - It's not possible. - I can't go without my rucksack. - There's no going back. Nobody goes back the same way they came. Forget your rucksack. What's in it? Diamonds? You'll lose your way. The Room will give you all you desire. It will snow you under with rucksacks. Is it far to this Room? Straight ahead, 200 meters, but there are no direct paths. Let's go. Don't let doubt creep in, Professor. Miracles are outside your experience. Remember how St. Peter nearly drowned. Go, Writer. - Go where? - Down the ladder. Professor, where are you? - This is the dry tunnel. - You call this dry? It's a local joke. Usually we have to swim it. Wait. Where's the professor? - What? - The professor's lost. Professor! Professor! He was following you the entire time. He must have strayed and lost his way. He didn't lose his way. He went back for his rucksack. Now he'll never get out. - Shall we wait for him? - We can't. Things change every minute. The two of us must go on. Look! What's all this? - I told you about it. - About what? This is the Zone. Do you understand? We have to hurry. Let's go. Here he is. I really appreciate that you... How did you get here? Most of the way, I crawled on all fours. Incredible. How did you manage to overtake us? Overtake you? I came back here for my rucksack. Where did the metal nut come from? My God. It's a trap. Porcupine hung it here on purpose. How did the Zone let us through? Lord. I won't take another step until — A good deal. Enough. So. We'll all rest here. But keep away from that metal nut in any case. I didn't think Professor would get out. I never know what sort of people I'm bringing in. It's only in here that things become clear, when it's too late. The main thing is that the professor's rucksack and spare pants are safe. Don't poke your nose into another guy's drawers, if you know what I mean. What's there to understand? Don't pull my leg with your binomial theorem and your psychological explanations. We're out of favor at the institute. We're refused funds for an expedition. So let's fill the rucksack with manometers, shit-ometers... ...slip into the Zone illegally... ...and check all the local miracles with algebra. No one in the world has any conception about the Zone, so it'll be a sensation. Television, your lady fans getting hot flashes, people carrying brooms as if they were laurel wreaths. Then our professor appears all in white and declaims, ""Mene, mene. Tekel upharsin."" Naturally, everyone gapes and shouts, ""Give him the Nobel Prize!"" You bedraggled hack writer. You homegrown psychologist. Fit only to scribble graffiti in lavatories, you talentless clod. That's feeble stuff. Call that an insult? You don't know how it's done. All right. Suppose I'm after a Nobel Prize. What are you after? Want to bestow on mankind the pearls of your bought inspiration? I spit on mankind. In all of your mankind, only one man interests me. And that's me. Am I worth anything, or am I shit like certain other people? What if you find out that's indeed what you are? Know something, Einstein? I don't want to argue with you. Truth is born in arguments, damn it. Listen, Chingachgook. You've brought so many people here. Not as many as I would like. It doesn't matter. Why did they come? What were they after? Happiness, more than anything. Yes, but what kind of happiness? People don't like to reveal their innermost thoughts. Anyway, that concerns neither you nor me. You've been lucky. All my life, I have never seen one happy person. Nor have I. They return from the Room, and I guide them back. And we never meet again. Wishes don't come true immediately, you know. And you've never wanted to make use of this Room? I'm fine as I am. Professor, listen. I'm thinking about inspiration you can buy. Suppose I return to our godforsaken city a genius. Understand? But a man writes because he's tormented, unsure of himself. He has to keep proving his worth to himself and to others. But if I'm convinced I'm a genius... ...then why do I need to write? What's the deal? Anyway, I must say we exist in order to — Just leave me in peace. Let me nap a little. I didn't sleep all last night. Keep your complexes to yourself. At any rate, all your technology — all those blast furnaces, wheels... ...and suchlike hustle and bustle so that people can work less and consume more... ...they're all crutches, artificial limbs. Mankind exists in order to — to create works of art. At least that's unselfish compared with all other human activities. Great illusions. Images of absolute truth. Are you listening to me, Professor? What unselfishness are you talking about? People keep dying of hunger. Have you been living on the moon? And this is our intellectual aristocracy. You're unable to think in abstract terms. Why don't you teach me the meaning of life... ...and, at the same time, how to think. It's useless. You may be a professor, but you're ignorant. ""And, lo, there was a great earthquake; And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair... ...and the moon became as blood; And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind. And the heavens departed as a scroll; and every mountain and island was moved out of its place. And the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the generals and the mighty men... ...and all free men hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; And they said to the mountains and rocks, 'Fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb. For the great day of his wrath has come, and who shall be able to stand?'"" ""That same day... ...two of them... ...were going to a village called Emmaus. And it came to pass that Jesus himself drew near and walked with them, but they did not recognize him. 'What manner of discussions are these... ...that you have one to another as you walk and are sad?' And one of them, named"" — You awake? You were talking about the meaning of our life... ...the unselfishness of art. Now, take music. It's connected least of all with reality. Or, if connected, then it's without ideas. It's merely empty sound without associations. Nevertheless, music miraculously penetrates your very soul. What chord in us responds to its harmonies... ...transforming it into a source of delight, uniting us and shattering us? Why is all this necessary? And, above all, for whom? You'll reply, ""For no one and no reason."" No. I doubt that. For everything in the final reckoning has a meaning. A meaning and a reason. You mean we go there? Unfortunately, there's no other way. It's rather gloomy, eh, Professor? I don't think I should go first here. Big Snake never volunteers. Obviously, we'll have to draw lots. Here, I'd prefer some volunteer. Got any matches? Thanks. The long match goes first. The long one. This time, you were out of luck. How about throwing a metal nut? Of course. You're welcome to. Another one? All right. I'm going. Hurry, Professor. Over here. There's some sort of door over here. Now it's over there. Open the door and go in. Me again? I should go in there? You drew your lot. You mustn't hang about. What have you got there? You can't go in there with a gun! You'll be killed, and you'll doom us! Remember the tanks! Put it away, I beg you. Don't you understand? If anything happens, I can get you out. But like this — Please, I beg you. And who — Who will you shoot at in there? Go! We've very little time. There's water here. Never mind. Hold onto the rail. Don't go any farther. Wait for us up there by the exit. I hope you've nothing like that. - Like what? - Like a pistol. I've an ampoule, for an emergency. - What kind of ampoule? - For protection. Poison. Good God, you mean you came here to die? That's how it is, just in case. Back! Return, it's suicide! I told you to wait at the exit. Don't move! It's all because of your pipe. - What? - Never mind. You should have gone first. He took the wrong turn out of fright. Another experiment. Experiments, facts or truth as a last resort. But there's no such things as facts, especially here. All this is someone's idiotic invention. Can't you tell? You, of course, want to know whose invention. What good will it do you to know? Whose conscience will be bothered by it? Mine? I have no conscience, only nerves. Some bastard abuses you, you're hurt. A different bastard praises you, you're hurt. You put your heart and soul into your work, and they devour you. They even devour the filth in your soul. They're all literate. They all have voracious appetites. They all keep crowding round — journalists, editors, critics, a constant stream of women. All of them clamoring for more. What kind of writer am I... ...if I detest writing? If it's torture for me, a painful, shameful occupation, something akin to extruding hemorrhoids. I used to think my books helped some people to become better, but nobody needs me. If I die, in a couple days, they'll find someone else to devour. I wanted to change them, but they've changed me to fit their own image. Once, the future was only a continuation of the present. All its changes loomed somewhere beyond the horizon. But now the future's a part of the present. Are they prepared for this? They don't want to know anything. All they do is gobble. You certainly are lucky. Now you'll live to be a hundred. Why not forever? Like the Wandering Jew. You must surely be a fine person. Not that I doubted it. You must have been through such agony. This pipe is the most terrible part of the Zone. They call it the meat grinder. How many people has it ground up? Porcupine sent his brother through instead of himself. He was so sensitive, so gifted. Listen to this. Now the summer is passed, it might never have been; It is warm in the sun, but it isn't enough; All that I could attain, like a five-fingered leaf, fell straight into my hand, but it isn't enough; Neither evil nor good has yet vanished in vain; It all burned and was light, but it isn't enough; Life has been like a shield and has offered protection; I have been very lucky, but it isn't enough; The leaves were not burned, the boughs were not broken; The day shines like glass, but it isn't enough. Fine, isn't it? That's his poem. Why are you evading things? ""Fine"" indeed! It makes me sick to look at you. You can't imagine how glad I am that we made it. Your conduct was exemplary. You're fine, honest men. I'm proud I was right. So he's happy we got back. So happy he could choke. Fate! Zone! So I'm a fine fellow. Do you think I didn't see you offer me two long matches? - You don't understand. - No, of course not. I'm sorry, Professor, but this louse chose you as his favorite. What are you going on about? He shoved me into the pipe because I'm a second-rate person. Meat grinder! What a word! What right have you to choose who lives, who goes into the meat grinder? You made the choice. What choice did I have — one of two long matchsticks? Forget the matches. Back by the metal nut, the Zone let you through to pass through the meat grinder. Is that for you? - Who knows? I never choose. You can't imagine how terrible it is to make the wrong choice. But someone has to go first. Yes? No, this isn't the clinic. Someone has to go first! How would you like it? Don't touch it! - Yes? - Laboratory Nine, please. One minute. I'm listening. - I hope I haven't disturbed you. - What do you want? Just a few words. You hid it. I found it in the old building, Bunker 4. Are you listening? - I'll inform the security service. Go on! Inform on me, write a denunciation. Set my colleagues against me. But you're late. I'm just two steps away from the place itself. Are you listening to me? You realize this finishes you as a scientist? So be happy. Do you realize what happens if you dare? Trying to scare me again? Yes, all my life I've been scared. Even of you. You don't scare me anymore. My God, you're not even Herostratus. You just wanted to trip me up because, 20 years ago, I slept with your wife. You've finally managed to settle the score. Go on, do your dirty work. Don't dare hang up on me. Prison isn't the worst thing that awaits you. You'll never forgive yourself for this. I can see you hanging from your belt over a prison latrine. What are you up to, Professor? Imagine what will happen when everyone believes in this Room... ...and when they all come hurrying here. It's only a question of time. Not today, but tomorrow. And in the thousands. All these would-be emperors, grand inquisitors, fuhrers of all shades. The so-called saviors of mankind! And not for money or inspiration, but to remake the world. - I'll never bring that sort here. - What do you understand? You're not the only stalker in the world. No stalker knows what ideas the people you bring here take away with them. The number of motiveless crimes is growing. Isn't that your work? What about the military coups? The mafia in the governments, couldn't they be your clients? What about the lasers, the deadly bacteria hidden away in vaults for the time being? Stop this sociological drivel! Do you really believe in these fairy tales? Not in the good ones, but in the terrifying ones, yes. Just stop it. No single individual can have enough hatred or love to spread over all mankind. You desire money, a woman. Or you want your boss to get run over. That's neither here nor there. But world domination, a just society, the kingdom of heaven on earth. Those aren't desires, but an ideology, actions, concepts. Subconscious compassion cannot yet be realized as a common instinctive desire. You can't be happy at the expense of others' unhappiness. I see you've decided to smash humanity with some inconceivable boon. Yet I'm completely calm. I'm not worried about you or myself or mankind. Nothing will come of it. At best, you'll receive your Nobel Prize... ...or more probably something quite inconceivable which you haven't even thought about. A telephone. You dream of one thing and get something quite different. Why did you do that? A telephone, electricity. Look, sleeping pills. This sort isn't prescribed anymore. Where did they come from? Shall we go there? It'll soon be evening, too dark to get back. By the way, I can see that all this poetry reciting and walking around is a new, original way of apologizing. I understand you. A difficult childhood environment. But don't fool yourself. I don't forgive you. Don't. Please. Professor, come here. Just a moment. No need to rush. I'm not rushing anywhere. Don't get angry. But I have to tell you. We're now standing at the threshold. This is the most important moment... in your life. You must know that... ...your most cherished desire will come true here. Your sincerest wish, the desire that has made you suffer most. There's no need to speak. You must only... concentrate and recall all your past life. When a man thinks of the past, he becomes kinder. But the main thing — The main thing is... ...you must believe. Now go. Who wants to go first? Perhaps you? Me? No, I don't want to. I know it's not easy. But don't worry. That will soon pass. I'm not sure... that it will. Firstly, if I begin to recall my life... ...I shall hardly become kinder. And then, can't you see how shameful all this is? To humiliate yourself. To snivel and to pray. What's bad about praying? That's your pride speaking. Relax. You're just not ready. That happens. Perhaps you'll go first? Me? Voilà! Here we have the professor's new invention. A device for testing the human soul. A soul meter. It's just a bomb. What? - You're joking. - No. It's just a 20-kiloton bomb. What for? I assembled it with some friends. With some former colleagues. This place, evidently, won't bring anyone happiness. And if it falls into evil hands... However, I really don't know now. Once we had the idea... ...that the Zone should not be destroyed. Even if it was a miracle, it was a part of nature. And in a certain sense, it means hope. They hid this bomb, but I've found it. It's an old building, Bunker 4. Obviously there must be a principle — never to perform irreversible actions. I understand that. I'm no maniac. But as long as this canker is open to any scoundrel... ...there can be no rest. Maybe something inside us won't permit it? Poor guy, he's made himself a problem. Give it to me. Give it to me! You're an intelligent man. - What's that for? - You hypocritical louse! Why — Why are you doing this to me? He wants to destroy your hope. There's nothing else left to people on Earth. This is the only place to come to when all hope is gone. You have to come here. Then why destroy hope? Shut up! I see through you. You don't give a damn about others. You earn your money from our... misery. It's not even the money. You enjoy this. Here you're czar and God. You louse, you decide who's to die and who's to live. He chooses, he decides. I know why the stalker himself never enters the Room. What for? You're drunk with power out here. With mystery! With authority! That's not true. You're wrong. A stalker is forbidden to enter the Room. Especially for his own selfish reasons. Remember Porcupine. Yes, I'm a louse. I've never achieved anything, and I can't do anything here. I have nothing to give my wife. I can't have any friends, but don't deprive me of what's mine. They took everything from me behind the barbed wire. Everything I have is here. Here, in the Zone. My happiness, my freedom, dignity. They're all here. The people I bring are unhappy like me. They've nothing left to hope for. Nobody can help them. But I can — a louse. A louse can help them! I weep for joy because I can help them. I ask for nothing more. I don't know. Maybe. Anyway, forgive me, but — You're simply one of God's fools. You've no conception of what's happening here. Why do you think Porcupine hanged himself? He came to the Zone for profit, and his brother died for money. I understand that, but why did he hang himself? Why didn't he come back? Not for money, but for his brother. Is that how he repented? He wanted to. But within a few days, he hanged himself. He realized that it is one's most secret desire that is granted here. What are you yelling about? What comes true here is that which reflects the essence of your nature. It is within you. It governs you. Yet you are ignorant of it. You've understood nothing. Greed didn't do Porcupine in. He crawled on his knees to plead for his brother, but he got a pile of money. He couldn't get anything else. Porcupine was given the essence of his true nature. Conscience and soul-searching were all invented by the mind. When he realized all that, he hanged himself. I won't go into your Room. I don't want to pour the filth in my soul onto anyone's head — even yours — and then hang myself as Porcupine did. Better to stay grunting in my stinking private villa. You're a bad judge of human nature if you bring people like me into the Zone. How did you learn that this miracle actually exists? Who told you that desires really come true here? Do you know one man who was made happy here? Perhaps Porcupine? And who told you about the Zone, about Porcupine, about this Room? He did. I don't understand anything at all. What's the sense in coming here? It's so still. Can you hear it? Suppose I chuck it all in... ...get my wife and Monkey and come here to live... ...forever. There's nobody here. No one will hurt them. You came back. Where did the dog come from? It tagged along. Don't chase it away. Well, shall we go? Monkey's waiting. Are we going? Does anybody want a dog? I've got five already. So you like dogs? What? That's good. All right, let's go. If you only knew how tired I am. Only God knows. They still call themselves the intelligentsia. Writers! Scientists! - Calm down. They don't believe in anything. Their capacity for faith has atrophied — - Calm yourself. - ...through lack of use. Stop it. Come, lie down. Don't worry. It's damp. You can't stay here. Take it off. My God, what kind people are they? Calm down. It isn't their fault. They should be pitied, not abused. Their eyes are blank. They're thinking how not to sell themselves cheap, how to get paid for every breath they take. They know they were born to ""be someone,"" to be an elite! They say, ""You live but once."" How can such people believe in anything at all? Relax now. Try to get some sleep. Go to sleep. Nobody believes. Not only those two. Nobody. Who shall I take there? Oh, Lord. The most terrible thing... ...is that nobody needs that Room and all my efforts are in vain. Why do you say that? Don't. I'll never go there again with anyone. If you want, I'll go there with you. Do you want that? Do you think I've nothing to ask for? No. You mustn't. - Why? No. What if you fail, too? You know, Mama was very opposed to it. You've probably already guessed that he's one of God's fools. Everyone around here used to laugh at him. He was such a wretched muddler. Mama used to say, ""He's a stalker, a marked man, an eternal jailbird. Remember the kind of children stalkers have."" I didn't even argue. I knew all about it — that he was a marked man, a jailbird, about the kids. Only what could I do? I was sure I'd be happy with him. I knew there'd be a lot of sorrow. But I'd rather know bittersweet happiness... ...than a gray, uneventful life. Perhaps I invented all this later. But when he came up to me and said, ""Come with me,"" I went. And I've never regretted it. Never. There was a lot of grief and fear and pain. But I've never regretted it nor envied anyone. It's just fate. It's life. It's us. And if there were no sorrow in our lives, it wouldn't be better. It would be worse. Because then there would be no happiness either. And there'd be no hope. So... I love those eyes of yours, my friend, Their sparkling, flashing, fiery wonder; When suddenly those lids ascend, Then lightning rips the sky asunder; You swiftly glance, and there's an end; There's greater charm, though, to admire When lowered are those eyes divine In moments kissed by passion's fire; When through the downcast lashes shine The smoldering embers of desire..."

you shouldn't have taken a turn at the bush. and this what's this? what? why are you sitting here? i live here. where? on the fence? are you interested in the way to tomshino or where i live? i brought all the instruments, but forgot the key. do you happen to have a nail or a screw-driver?

why do you look so sad? and why do you look so happy? it's a pleasure to fall down with an attractive woman. you know, i fell and found strange things here   roots, bushes has it ever occurred to you that plants can feel, know, even comprehend the trees, this hazel-nut bush this is the alder-tree. it doesn't matter. they don't run about. like us who are rushing, fussing, uttering banalities. that's because we don't trust nature that is inside us. always this suspiciousness, haste, and no time to stop and think. look, you seem to be a bit it's no problem for me. i'm a doctor. and what about ""ward number six""? oh, chekhov had made it all up! come to tomshino sometime. we often have a good time there. you've got blood! where? behind your ear. each moment of our dates, not many, we celebrated as an epiphany. alone in the whole world. more daring and lighter than a bird down the stairs, like a dizzy apparition, you came to take me on your road, through rain-soaked lilacs, to your own possession, to the looking glass world. as night descended i was blessed with grace, the altar gate opened up, and in the darkness shining and slowly reclining was your body naked. on waking up i said: god bless you! although i knew how daring and undue my blessing was: you were fast asleep, your closed eyelids with the universal blue the lilac on the table so strained to sweep. touched by the blue, your lids were quite serene, your hand was warm. and rivers pulsed in crystal slits, mountains smoked, and oceans swarmed. you held a sphere in your palm, of crystal; on your throne you were sleeping calm. and, oh my god! belonging only to me, you woke and at once transformed the language humans speak and think. speech rushed up sonorously formed, with the word ""you"" so much reformed as to evolve a new sense meaning king. and suddenly all changed, like in a trance, even trivial things, so often used and tried, when standing 'tween us, guarding us, was water, solid, stratified. it carried us i don't know where. retreating before us, like some mirage, were cities, miraculously fair. under our feet the mint grass spread, the birds were following our tread, the fishes came to a river bend, and to our eyes the sky was open. behind us our fate was groping, like an insane man with a razor in his hand. oh, good heavens! dounya! what is it, pasha?! a fire! but be quiet. he'll get it coming to him! and what if vitya is in there? what if he's burned? where's klanya? what? dad! alexei? hello, ma! what's wrong with your voice? nothing serious. i guess it's just a sore throat. i haven't spoken to anyone for three days. i even liked it. i think it's good to keep silent for a while. words can't express everything a person feels. words are flaccid. i just dreamed of you in my sleep. as though i were still a child by the way, what year was it when dad left us? 1935. why? and the fire? remember the hay-loft that burned down at the farm? that was in ""35 too. all right, stop pulling the wool over my eyes. you know lisa died. the one i worked in the printing house with. oh god when? this morning, at 7. and what time is it now? what is now? almost six. in the morning? what's the matter with you? in the evening. mom, why do we have to fight all the time? i'm sorry if i did anything wrong. printing-house. next stop: serpukhovskaya. what's the rush? hello. where're the proofs i've been reading? i don't know. just a minute. yelizaveta pavlovna is here. marousia, what's wrong? something in yesterday's proofs? in the goslit edition? don't be so nervous! we should look in the typesetting case. nothing terrible has happened. it's such an important edition! although misprints have no place in any edition. shut up, you idiot. what happened? nothing serious. i just want to check something. i may be wrong let's start from the beginning. i'd rather do it myself. everybody's rushing, no one's got any time! you think i'm afraid? no, let other people be afraid. some people should work, and others should be afraid. well, nothing awful has happened. if it happened, it happened. we've been printing all night i waited for you since yesterday's morning. that you won't come they probably guessed. remember what a beautiful weather it was? a holiday weather! and i walked coatless. today you're here, and they have arranged an utterly gloomy and cloudy day, it rains, and it's getting unusually late, the rain drops run down the cold terrain, unsoothable by word, unwipable by hand you see, it wasn't there, was it? everything is all right. it wasn't that would've been a horrid mistake. why are you crying then? i even saw that word typeset. what word? great! this is pure alcohol. not much, but it might help. you've got all drenched up. you look like a scarecrow! really, i'm all wet. i guess i'll go and take a shower. where's my comb? you know who you resemble now? who? maria timofeyevna. what maria timofeyevna? here. you've been looking for your comb, haven't you? tell me, who's maria timofeyevna? there was such a woman, captain lebyadkin's sister. you're the spitting image of lebyadkina. in what way do i resemble her? yes, fyodor mikhailovich was whatever you may say what? lebyadkin, bring some water! the difference is her brother would not bring her water, but beat her. explain it. i don't understand. all your life is just that ""bring some water!"" just an appearance of independence. if something doesn't suit you, you pretend it doesn't exist. what nonsense you're talking! i'm amazed at the patience of your ex-husband. he should have run away much sooner. what do you want from me? have you ever admitted you were wrong? never! you just made up this whole situation! as long as you haven't succeeded in elevating your dear husband to this nonsensical emancipated condition of yours, then you can be sure he has been saved just in time. as for your children, you will definitely make them miserable. stop this idiocy! come on now, masha! leave me alone! my earthly life traversed but by a half, i found myself lost in a twilight forest i always said that you resemble my mother. apparently, that's the reason we divorced. i notice with horror how much ignat is becoming like you. why with horror? we two could never talk like normal human beings. when i recall my childhood and my mother, somehow she always has your face. i know why though. i pity you both, you and her. why? ignat, put the glass down! you won't be able to live a normal life with anyone. probably. don't feel offended. you seem to be convinced that the very fact of your existence close by will make everybody happy. you only know how to demand. that's because i was brought up by women. if you don't want ignat to become like that, get married as soon as possible. get married to whom? this i don't know. or give ignat to me. why didn't you make it up with your mother? it was your fault. what fault? she's convinced herself she knows better than i how i should live. that she can make me happy. as far as mother is concerned, i can feel it better than you. what can you feel better? that we're getting more and more distant, and i can't do anything about it. natalya, try to distract him. he's talking of spain again. it will end up in a scandal. i wanted to ask you for a favor we're redecorating now. ignat wants to live with you for a week. i will be very happy. what does he say? he's showing the great matador palomo linares. most of all he was excited by the farewell he was given. the whole town came to see him off. people sang and danced. his mother couldn't come, she was sick. and his father stood aside, sad and silent. he knew they were thinking the same thing: that they probably will never see each other again. are you mocking at us or what? we taught you and taught and it was no use. now it turns out you can! he went to spain and didn't understand anything. did you ever want to go back to spain? i can't go, i've got a russian husband. and russian children. i'll talk to her myself! ignat! come here. i'm leaving. always in a hurry don't put it together, just give it to me like that. oh, i felt an electric shock. what shock? as if it had already happened but i've never been here before. come on, give me the money and stop dreaming. clean up a bit, make the place tidy. don't touch anything here. if maria nikolaevna comes tell her to wait for me. come in. how are you? may we have another cup for the young man? take the notebook from the third shelf in the bookcase, will you? read from the page that is marked with a ribbon. ""to the question how sciences and arts affect people's morals, rousseau answered: negatively'."" read only what is underlined with the red pencil. ""notwithstanding the "" oh no! ""the division of churches separated us from europe. we remained excluded from every great event that had shaken it. however, we had our own, special destiny. russia, with her immense territory, had swallowed up the mongol invasion. the tartars didn't dare crossing our western borders. they retreated to their wilderness and christian civilization had been saved. to attain that goal we had to lead a special kind of life which, while leaving us christians, had made us alien to the christian world. as for our historic insignificance, i cannot agree with you on that. don't you find anything significant at all in today's situation in russia that would strike a future historian? although i'm heartily attached to our sovereign, i'm not at all delighted with everything i see around me. as a man of letters, i'm being annoyed, insulted, but i swear that for nothing in the world would have made me change my home country or have any other history than the history of our forbears, such as it was given us by god. "" from pushkin's letter to chaadayev. october 19, 1836. go, open up. i'm afraid i've got the wrong address. ignat, how are you doing? did maria nikolaevna come? no. though some woman came, but she's got the wrong apartment. find something to do or invite somebody. do you know any girls? you mean from my class? oh no! at your age i was already in love during the war with a redhead her lips were always blistered. our military instructor was chasing after her, he was shell-shocked. are you listening to me? what did you fire at? you think i didn't see it? you were firing up! what's wrong with that? there's no one there. and what if somebody was there? there're only trees there. and what if somebody climbed a tree? about face! i commanded ""about face""! put down your rifle. that's what i did. did you learn drill regulations? about face in russian means exactly what i did. about face means a turn of 360 degrees. what degrees? about face! to the firing position forward march! i'm going to send you for your parents. what parents? you'll know very soon what parents. what is the firing position? down on the floor mat! his parents died during the siege. the firing position is a firing position. markov! yes, sir! name the basic elements of the rifle. the butt. the muzzle. it's you who's a muzzle. what is the muzzle then? guys! a grenade! it's a hand grenade! don't do it! down on the ground! you'll be killed! it's only a dummy grenade. and you say you're from leningrad and been under the siege i don't believe in premonitions. i have no trust in superstitions. i don't run from slander or venom. there's no death on earth. all are immortal, everything's immortal. don't be afraid of death at seventeen, at seventy as well there's just reality and light. there's neither death nor darkness in this world. at last we all have reached the shore, and i'm the one who casts a fishing rod when immortality is coming in a shoal. live in a house, and it'll never fall. to any of the centuries i'd nod and enter it, a house i'd install. that's why with me your children share board, your wives join me at my table, and all. one table serves both granddad and grandchild: the future's being made right now. whenever i'm to raise my hand in tide, i all five rays of it on you bestow. with collarbones, as if with timber work, i propped up every day of past age. i measured time by a world-wide walk, i passed through it like through the urals range. i chose the age up to my own measure. we headed south, with dust flying away, the weeds smoked up, and at his own leisure, his feeler on the horseshoe, the grasshopper forecast he prophesied me death, as if he were a monk. but with my fate strapped to my saddle fast, i'm riding now in the time to come and surging on the stirrups to my own drum. my immortality is quite enough for me. for my own blood to flow ages through, for steady warmth and a haven safe and true i'd give my life self-willingly and freely, had not its volatile, needle-like sword been leading me, like a thread, throughout the world. marousia? and the children? where are the children? i'm going to tell everybody that you've stolen the book. what? i will, you'll see. now stop it! go on, tell everybody! i will, anyway! marina! you could have come more often. you know that he's missing you. let ignat live with me. are you serious? you said yourself that he would like to. with you it's better to keep one's mouth shut. you mean i'm inventing this for my own pleasure? let's ask him. whatever he decides besides, it will make your life much easier. why would this make it easier for me? have you collected your books? go say goodbye to your father. your mother and i would like to ask you what? wouldn't it be better if you lived with me? how? you and i will live together. haven't you said so to your mother? said what? when? no, please. we really look alike, don't we? not at all! what do you want from your mother? what kind of relationship? the kind of relationship you had in your childhood is impossible. you speak of some feeling of guilt, of her life being ruined because of you well, you can't get away from it. and what she needs is for you to become a baby again, for her to be able to carry you and protect you. why on earth am i meddling in it? it's always like this why are you whimpering? explain it. should i marry him or not? do i know him? no is he ukrainian? does it matter? what is he doing? he is a writer. doesn't his name happen to be dostoyevsky? yes, dostoyevsky. he hasn't written anything worthwhile. nobody knows him. he must be about 40, isn't he? apparently he's got no talent? you've changed so much. so, he has no talent, he doesn't write anything. he does write, but they don't publish him. look, our precious flunk has put something on fire. no need to be so ironic about his flunking. if he doesn't finish school, he'll end up being drafted. and you will go begging to have him exempted from the army. this is all the result of your indulging him. by the way, the army would be good for him. why don't you call your mother? after aunt lisa's death she stayed in bed for three days. wasn't she supposed to come here at five? is it so difficult to make the first move? we were talking about ignat. it may be my fault, too. or is it because we got so bourgeois? and our embourgeoisement is so dense, so asian. with private ownership nonexistent, our well-being is on the rise. nothing makes any sense anymore. why do you get so irritated? i know a family whose 15-year-old son said: ""i'm leaving you. it disgusts me to see how you weasel around trying to please everybody. "" good boy. not like our booby. unfortunately, our boy would never say such a thing. i can imagine that family of yours! they're no worse than we are. he works for a newspaper. and thinks he's a writer, too. though he's unable to understand that a book is not a way of making money but a statement. a poet is called upon to provoke a spiritual jolt and not to cultivate idolaters. what am i going to do? you're going to get married. do you happen to remember who was it who saw a bush on fire? i mean the angel as a bush? i don't remember. in any case, it was not ignat. maybe we should send him to a cadet school? an angel as a flame coming from a bush appeared to prophet moses. he led his people out across the sea. why has nothing like that ever appeared to me? with an amazing regularity i keep seeing one and the same dream. it seems to make me return to the place, poignantly dear to my heart, where my grandfather's house used to be, in which i was born 40 years ago right on the dinner table. each time i try to enter it, something prevents me from doing that. i see this dream again and again. and when i see those walls made of logs and the dark entrance, even in my dream i become aware that i'm only dreaming it. and the overwhelming joy is clouded by anticipation of awakening. at times something happens and i stop dreaming of the house and the pine trees of my childhood around it. then i get depressed. and i can't wait to see this dream in which i'll be a child again and feel happy again because everything will be still ahead, everything will be possible mommy! mom, they opened up! what's the matter with you? hello. hello. are you nadezhda petrovna? i don't think i i'm matvey ivanov's stepdaughter. he was a friend of your husband. what matvey? the doctor. he used to live here. then he moved to yurievets and became a legal expert. are you from town? we're from moscow, but we have a room in yurievets. we were evacuated last fall. the air raids on moscow began and i have two kids. my mother has some old connections here my husband is not here, he's in town. stop scratching yourself! actually i came to see you. it's a ladies' little secret. come on in. don't stand there wipe your feet. masha's just washed the floor. sit here for a while. we won't be long. why are you sitting in the dark? did it go out? you should've called us. what's your name? alyosha. i've got a son, too. not so big as you, of course. it's not easy having kids now, with the war going. i wish i had a girl too. want to have a look? he's asleep. we'll be quiet. he's such a darling. the other day he asked his father: ""why is 5 kopecks bigger than 10 kopecks?"" i was just dumfounded, and his father didn't know what to say. he always wanted a daughter. he even thought of a girl's name. and i prepared a pink layette. then i had to make everything anew. he put us up to a lot of trouble, little rascal. we woke you up, didn't we? that's your mommy's fault, she just can't stop talking. see, we've got company. some strangers, aren't they? you just wouldn't wake up, would you? all right, honey, go back to sleep. do they become me? and the ring? what's wrong? i just felt queasy. of course, you've made a long trip. i should have known better. have a drink. it will warm you up. i just talk and talk when i ought to make supper. oh please, you don't have to do it. but i can't let you go like that. we had a meal before leaving. i don't like his cough! well, he runs wild we must have my husband examine him. we can't wait, we have a two-hour walk to make. and what about the earrings? my husband's got the money. we're going to have a cock slaughtered. only may i ask you i'm three months pregnant and having fits of sickness. even when i'm milking a cow, it gets so bad as for the cock could you? well, i myself what, you too? no, but i've never done it before. oh, it's nothing. sure, in moscow you ate them already slaughtered. i usually do it right here, on this little log. here's the axe. my husband has sharpened it this morning. you mean, right in the room? we'll put a basin under. and tomorrow you'll take a chicken with you. no, i can't. maybe we'll ask alyosha to do that? after all, he's a man. why alyosha? all right, hold it tight. if it breaks loose, it'll smash the dishes. oh no, i don't feel well? calm down. everything will be all right. i wish i could see you not only when i feel too bad. do you hear me? yes. at last i soared up. what's wrong, marousia? you feel bad? don't be surprised. i love you. are you leaving already? and the earrings? my husband'll be right here. he's got the money. we changed our mind. it's fifteen versts to the town. it's going to be dark soon. that's all right, don't worry. a man has but one body, like a single cell. the soul is sick and tired of its too solid shell, with ears, mouth, eyes the size of a nickel coin and skin all scarred and diced, spread over a skeleton. through cornea it wings to a heavenly spring, to ice-laden slings, to a chariot birds bring. it hears through the grating of its living prison pen the fields' and forests' rattling, the seven seas' refrain. without body a soul's nude, as a body's nude without a shirt: no thought's forthcoming, no good, no idea's born and no word. a question that has no answer: whoever can come back from the floor where no dancer was ever to leave track? i dream of another soul, in quite a different garb: while shifting between dole and hope, it burns up, like alcohol, and goes away, casts no shadow and just leaves as mementoes the lilacs smelling of meadow. run on, my child, do not lament the fate of poor eurydice, just keep on driving to globe's end your copper hoop for all to see. as long as answering to your step, however slight might be a tone, the earth sends signals gay and pep to every energetic bone. mom, the kerosene stove is smoking. what? everything will depend on him. do you think a sore throat could have such an after-effect? a sore throat has nothing to do with it. this is a common case. common? a mother dies suddenly, then the man's wife and child a few days and the man is no more, though he was quite healthy. but no one died in his family. there're such things as conscience memories what memories have to do it with it? you think he's guilty of something? he thinks so. leave me alone. did you say something? leave me alone! i just wanted to be happy. and what's going to happen to your mother if you don't get up? it's nothing, everything will be all right everything will be would you rather have a boy or a girl?"
Von Trier,Antichrist,"how are you? didn't we just talk about that? that was yesterday. today is tuesday. so i've been here long? a month. wayne says my grief pattern is atypical yeah got to talk with wayne. i think he gives too much medication way too much stop it, please. trust on this to be smarter than you. he strayed out of medical school he don't know what he's doing i've treated ten tenths as many patients as he has but you're not a doctor. no, i'm not and i'm proud that i'm not a doctor like him. there is nothing ... atypical about your grief it was my fault. what about me? i was there too. i could have stopped him. no. you didn't know that he... started waking up lately i was aware that he would sometimes ... wake up and crawl out of bed and walk about just as you thought that he was soundly asleep he could open the baby gate he ... he woke up ... and w... was confused hey! dr.wayne says he won't be back home. you couldn't leave it, could you? you had to mettle. this place leads nowhere. on the contrary ... grief it's not a disease ... it's a natural healthy reaction. you can't just remove it you mustn't ... wayne knows you're a therapist he said you shouldn't treat your own family in principle i agree, but ... but you're just so much smarter aren't you? i love you. nothing hurts more than to see the one thy in love ... subjected to mistakes and wrongs no therapist can know as much about you as i do - it hurts. - i know. there's no way around it. i want to talk to ... i'm not gonna let you do that. why not just go all alone? no. a little change. wouldn't get any worse ... yes, it will. you're always been distant from me and nick ever i come to think of it very very distant okay can you give me some examples from this? hell, that's not that difficult to understand. i've lost someone, for instance... you terribly distant lost someone as a father ... and as a husband. and that was nick's last summer you missed that on too bad i never interested you. until now. that i'm your patient. perhaps i'm not supposed to talk about these things there is nothing you can't talk about you are indifferent to whether your child is alive or dead i bet you have a lot of clever therapist replies to that. haven't you? well, actually ... it was to ... honor your wish. you wanted peace to write. perhaps i didn't mean it what i understood ... is that you want me to ride alone that you and nick, were going to go to eden. just the two of you that way you could finish your thesis but i didn't you didn't? you see? you didn't even know that. why did you give up? that's not like you the hope project just seemed ... less important upthere. as you said, when i like told you about my subject... glib i never called your subject glib perhaps you didn't use that word, but that's what you meant. and all of a sudden it was glib or even was ... some kind of lie. i see no, you don't see. you see a lot of things but not that. inhale... on a count of five call me, call me. just ... follow me ... do it with me ... inhale ... inhale ... on a count to five ... inhale... two stay with me ... stay with me ... i'm gonna teach you how to breathe. inhale ... 2 ... 3 ... 4, 5, hold. 2 ... 3 ... 4, 5, exhale ... good. imagine ... imagine you're blowing on your ... vessel plumbs calmly, quietly ... yes, yes, that's good. that's good. that's very good. i told you there would be a change. you're still mourning but you're in a new phase. what phase? anxiety. anxiety. yes this is physical. it's dangerous. no, it's not dangerous. just as your grief wasn't dangerous a main part of anxiety is physical dizzy spells dry mouth ... misguided hearing ... trembling heavy breathing ... less pulse ... nausea ... hey! easy ... never screw your therapist. no matter how much your therapist may like it i know that distracts you, but ... it's not good for us. do the breathing. hold exhale you love me? yes, i do then help me. it's what i'm doing exposure that's the only thing that really works ... everything else is ... just talk you have to have the courage to stay in the situation that frightens you. and then you'll learn that fear isn't dangerous. let's make a list of things you're afraid of. in the top you put the situation you fear the most but i don't know what i'm afraid of just ... take your time. i'm thinking. okay i'm thinking, but ... can't i just be afraid without a definite object? no, no! this won't do stupe stupidest thing i could do to you if you can't tell me ... what your fear's of. maybe it would be easier for you to tell me where you're afraid? where would you feel most exposed? what would be the worst place? an apartment? the street? a store? the park? listening to someone, maybe. the woods. the woods? the woods, yes. it's funny because ... you were the one that always wanted to go into the woods what scares you about the woods? what frightens you... there? everything tell me what you think is supposed to happen in the woods. eh? is it any woods in particular? eden. eden? what do you say we put... a garden round eden at the top of the pyramid? no. not quite at the top. no. okay it's... it's okay - i'm sorry - it's okay we can start by working on your expectations close your eyes. feel the seat underneath you. feel yourself sinking down into it folding you ... it's a nice feeling. what you feel is a pleasant warmth and heaviness your breath... is deep i gather you sink ... down ... imagine you're at eden. imagine you arrived at eden through the woods. tell me what you see? i'm at the bridge. it's evening almost no voice can be heard. the water is running without a sound. darkness comes out anytime here i walk into it the little deers ... are hiding. among their friends. as usual. is it difficult to go upthere? no. not really. that is almost okay in a mountain of trees ... almosty there's a built foxhole how do you feel there? i can't really tell. it should be easy ... passing and yet ... it's like walking through mud. the trunk is thick the dear old **** it has some strange kind of personality. i've always found that. no. where are you, are you...? are you heading for the cabin? yes, i am i'm walking up above ... through the tall grass ... then don't come in. don't go in. you see outside you're afraid of don't look around ... no. lie down on the green. you want me to lie down? lie down on the grass. on top of all the plants? yes, lie down on the plants. are you lying down? yes good what is everything like around you? green. it's all very green. good now will you do what i ask you? yes what do you want me to do? i want you... to melt... into the green. don't fight it. just ... turn green. no matter what happens you were there. you did it. let fear come, if it likes. remember. but the mind can concieve and believe it can achieve what's wrong? ground is burning. the ground is not burning. gotta go. i want to lie down. just for a minute. sure. yea. we'll take a rest. shouldn't we go home? yeah yeah, we should. scared? stay awake for me. relax stay ... stay in there. it's just stupid acorns what are you doing? i'm just ... setting up... a little exercise. it's... it's like a ... it's like a game. you cheated me yesterday. running is not good. ... you have to really feel the grass. i want you to go from this stone ... to this stone. pretty scary, huh? you're ready? yea i'll give you a ride. i'll put you on the first stone. stay with me here we go put your foot down i got you. i got you i'm right here. i can't do this. yes, you can. you can and you will. just like i will. we're gonna walk together. we're gonna walk together, okay? now ... alright now, breathe. let's step off the rock. and step on that grass. step down see? ... what happened? keep breathing ... see? keep breathing i've got you you're really doing great okay? ... keep breathing. five, five and five. you're almost there. you're almost there you're doing great ... five. we're there ... we are there here, told you you did it you learned something. didn't you? you did beautiful. you did beautiful. i miss him so much ... i've been afraid of here before. yes, it seems likely. i just didn't know it was fear. i became afraid ... and i stopped writing. what was different ... the last time? i heard a sound. nick? nick! nick! nick! nick! you didn't hear nick screaming. apparently not. and because you experienced something that you can't explain rationally, you placed eden very high on the pyramid chart. eden was the catalyst that triggered your fear. you jumped to conclusions. entitled the emotional event with a place. when you feel threat it's natural to react. if the danger were real ... your fear would save your life. because your adrenaline will be used for fight or flight. but what you're experiencing is panic, nothing more. the scream wasn't real stop! calm down. you shouldn't have come here. you're just so damn arrogant. but this may not last. have you thought of that? oak trees grow to be hundreds of years old they only have to produce one single tree, every hundred years. in order to perpetuate ... may sound benign to you but ... it was a big thing for me to realize that when i was out here with nick. the acorns fell on the roof then too... kept falling, and falling and dying ... and dying. and i understood that ... everything that used to be beautiful about eden was perhaps hideous now i could hear what i couldn't hear before. the cry of... all the things that are to die it's all... very touching if it was a children's book. acorns don't cry you know that as well as i do. that's what fear is. your thoughts distort reality. look the other way around ... satan's church satan?... jesus! nature is satan's church. what? well, there you have him that was his brother. nick? he drifted away from me the last time. he was always out and about... he might have made more of an effort to be there for me. you look like you slept well. thanks, i did. i just wanted to say how happy i am that you're here ... i love you darling... did you have a good sleep? i've just been having a lot of ... crazy dreams ... dreams are of no interest in modern psychology. freud is dead, isn't he? what are you doing? look! i'm well again. i'm cured. see? perfect. i'm fine. you can't just be happy for me, can you? chaos ... reigns chapter three: the despair i want to do one more excercise. it's like a role play. my role ... is .. all the thoughts that provoke your fear ... yours ... is rational thinking. i am nature ... all the things that you call nature. okay mr.nature what do you want? to hurt you as much as i can. how? how do you think? by frightening me? by killing you. nature can't hurt me. you just told you're the green in the outside... no, i'm more than that. i don't understand. i'm outside, but also... within i'm nature of all human beings oh, that kind of nature. the kind of nature that... causes people do the evil things against women that's exactly who i am. that kind of nature interested me a lot. when i was uphere that kind of nature was the subject to my thesis ... but you shouldn't underestimate eden. what did eden do? i discovered somethng else in my material than i expected. if human nature is evil... then that goes as well... that the nature ... of the women. female nature. the nature of all the sisters. women do not control their own bodies nature does. i have it in writing in my books. the literature you used in your office search... was about evil things committed against women. but you read it as proof of the evil of women? you were supposed to be critical of those says that was your thesis instead you're embracing it do you know what you're saying? forget it. i do not know why i said it. it can't work anymore now. hit me. what? hit me so it hurts ... no. hit me, please. no! i can't stand it i do not want to i do not want to... then you don't love me. okay maybe i don't love you. yeah again ... again. this is too from nature's spell ... could start a hail storm ... i'm not gonna continue this if you don't listen to me. good... and evil. have nothing to do with therapy. you know how many innocent women were killed in the sixteenth century alone just for being women? i'm sure you do... many. not because they were evil... i know. it's just sometimes i forget. the evil you talk about is an obsession. obsessions never materialize. it's a scientific fact. anxieties can't trick you into doing things you won't do otherwise... it's like hypnotizing you you can't be hypnotized into doin something you wouldn't... normally do. something against your nature. you understand me? yeah, i think so. you think so? you don't have to understand me, just trust me. what's this? it's from the medical officer it's a copy of the autopsy report. the autopsy? they performed an autopsy? i didn't wanna tell you, because you weren't feeling well. well what did they find? nothing that would have any ... bearing on the case. the only abnormality in the victim is a slight deformity of the bones in his feet, of an earlier date we did not attention a significance to this. you were rather to put nick's shoes on wrong in this picture? well how i would?! a slip of the mind that day? i wish herself. bastard. you're leaving me, aren't you? get off me, bastard. you're leaving me. i'm not. i'm helping you. - you're leaving me, aren't you? - no! - i love you. - i don't believe you! yes i don't believe you! i don't fucking believe you! where are you? you bastard! where are you? where are you? where are you? where are you? you bastard! where are you? where are you? how dare you leave me? you said you wanted to help me. where are you? where are you? where are you? you bastard! get out! get out! you bastard! get out! you bastard! get out! get out! get out! you bastard! get out! sorry. you gotta get this thing off... my leg i can't find the wrench. did you want to kill me? not yet the three beggars aren't here yet. the three beggars? what does that mean? when the three beggars arrive ... someone must die. i see. the crying woman is a scheming woman. false in legs false in thighs false in breasts teeth, hair and eyes hold me hold me there is no such constellation. none of it is any use not good. no!"
Von Trier,Breaking the Waves,"his name is jan. i do not know him. he's from the rig. you know we do not favor matrimony with outsiders. can you even tell us what matrimony is? it's when two people are joined in god. do you really believe you're capable... of bearing the responsibility not only for your own marriage in god... but also another's? i know i am. can you think of anything of real value... that the outsiders have brought with them? their music. out you go, bess mcneill, and be seated. v(tm)ie forgot my six-string razor v(tm)ie v(tm)ie and hit the sky v(tm)ie v(tm)ie halfway to memphis before i realized v(tm)ie v(tm)ie well, i rang the information v(tm)ie v(tm)ie my ax was cold v(tm)ie v(tm)ie they said she rides a train to oriole v(tm)ie v(tm)ie now it's a mighty long way down the dusty v(tm)ie bess. - bess, don't be silly. you'll ruin your... - he's late. all right, but at least he's coming. get this on then. you're gonna ruin your dress. he's late. you're being silly. come on. - come on. - no. bess, get your coat on. - come on. don't ruin it. it's a good day. - no. you're not supposed to see him. you know that. bess, you're gonna ruin your... bess! you're late! come on. get in. hey! break out the bottle! come on. it's my wedding. will you please be upstanding for the bride?

- oh! - oh! - hey! - whoo-hoo-hoo! great. this is dodo. oh, the sister-in-law. we haven't really met, have we? no. but everything happened so quickly. what makes you say that? i just mean... well, it did, didn't it? are you not happy for me? of course i am. of course i am. come on, terry. - whoo-hoo-hoo! hey! - yee-ha! hey, hey, hey! yee-ha! get along, little dogie! bess. yeah. dear bess... i've known you for six years... and i can definitely say... you have the biggest heart of anyone i've ever met. it wasn't easy for me here when i married sam... but you welcomed me instantly... and i won't ever forget that. your generosity knows no bounds... like the time when you lent jack a bike... because his was broken, only it was mine, and i had to walk to work. i was furious with you then... but i regret that now... because it's your spirit. you'd give anything to anyone. when sam died, i lost a husband and you, a brother. we saw each other through that... and promised to look after one another. you are the reason... sorry. you are the reason i have stayed when i almost gave up in this cold place. and now your warmth... has embraced another outsider. his name is jan... and i don't know much about him... but i'll accept his right to be here... because of you, bess. if he doesn't take care of you and give you everything you need, i'll kill him. thank you... for all you've given me, bess. i love you very much. have me now. what, here? maybe you wanted something more romantic. this is lovely. are you sure? no, have me. what do i do? you okay? you've got blood on your dress. shall i go down and wait for you? you okay? hi. whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo! yee-ha! take care of yourself. get her now, jan. whoo! yeah! yeah! yeah! whoo! - whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo! - yeah! go get her, jan! whoo! whoo, whoo! v(tm)ie every day i spend my time v(tm)ie v(tm)ie drinkin' wine, feelin' fine v(tm)ie v(tm)ie waitin' here to find the sign v(tm)ie v(tm)ie that i can understand v(tm)ie v(tm)ie yes, i am v(tm)ie v(tm)ie in the days between the hours v(tm)ie v(tm)ie ivory towers, bloody flowers v(tm)ie v(tm)ie push their heads into the air v(tm)ie v(tm)ie i don't care if i ever know v(tm)ie v(tm)ie there i go v(tm)ie v(tm)ie don't push your love too far v(tm)ie i can't get this fucker open. shit. what's so funny? how could you take it? how could keep away from the boys? i waited for you. no, don't laugh. yeah. but you must have been lonely. who did you talk to? i thank you for the greatest gift of all... the gift of love. i thank you for jan. i'm so lucky to have been given these gifts. but remember to be a good girl, bess... for you know i giveth, and i taketh away. what? i didn't mean it like that. yes. i'll be good. i'll be really, really good. thank you. what did you say? thank you. fly... away! - hello, jan. - hello. - bess. - hello. why don't you have any church bells? we do not need bells in our church to worship god. i like church bells. let's put them back again. have fun. but now, friends... things have become very different. it hurts me to have to say it... but there appears to be those in the church... who are prepared to cling to the world... instead of fleeing from it. but those to whom i refer... will know what i am speaking about. it grieves my heart. and i know there are others who feel just the same. amen. mr. donald john beaton, will you rise and address the question? thank you, lord, for this day you have blessed us with. it's stupid that only men can talk in the service. hold your tongue, woman. lassie! it's lassie! it is lassie! i know it. lassie! oh, lassie! lassie! oh, lassie! oh, welcome home! they're burying anthony now. go and listen to the minister. go on. yeah, you can do that if you want. men are allowed at funerals. go on. anthony dod mantle, who has been... anthony dod mantle, you are a sinner... and you deserve your place in hell. hmm. the minister said he would go to hell. did he say that? bloody cheerful. well, anthony will go to hell. everyone knows that. you do realize that i will have to go back soon, don't you? you knew it all the time. lord, we are unworthy of the least of all thy mercies. we thank thee for this food. pardon our sins for jesus' sake. amen. amen. okay. when are you going back? oh, didn't you know? jan's gonna stay at home with me and quit the rig because we're so happy. oh, bess. come on. i wish i could. i will not have that kind of behavior in my house. i'm sorry, mother. i'm sorry. if you cannot control your moods, it's the hospital again for you, my girl. - i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. - why should you be any different? every woman round here has to learn to be alone... when their man's away at sea or on the oil rigs. even you can learn how to endure. i don't even know who you are. i don't know anything about you. and quite frankly... i'm sorry... i'm sorry to say this, but i don't trust you. she's... she's very susceptible... and you could get her to... you could get her to do anything you wanted. no, i don't think so. how am i supposed to look out for her now? what do you wanna do? keep her here? - locked up for the rest of her life? - she hasn't got the strength. - she's stronger than you and me. - you don't understand, do you? - she's not right in the head. - come on. she just wants it all. what's this? hmm? what? what's that? what's that? it's a present. - can i open it? - yeah, sure. open it. nice colors, aren't they? very cheerful. it's open. - just waiting for you, bud. - please. yeah, that's fine. do you want a little snort?

bess, you've got to stop all this, you know. you've got to go on living when he isn't here. i mean, he's not dead. you're not dead. you know what i mean? - give it to me. - you just... you've got to stop it. shh. - it's all right. nothing. go back to sleep. - what's going on? - it's all right. it's all right. - was that bess? - no, it's okay. - bit of hysterics. no, no. it's all right. i'll sort it out. - we're not to have this carry-on in the house. - i know. - just stay where you are. go back to sleep. - it's terrible. bess mcneill... for many years you've prayed for love. shall i take it away from you again? is that what you want? oh. no. i'm still grateful for love. what do you want then? i pray for jan to come home. he will be coming home in 10 days. you must learn to endure. you know that. i can't wait. this is unlike you, bess. out there, there are people who need jan and his work. what about them? they don't matter. nothing else matters. i just want jan home again. i pray to you. oh, please, won't you send him home? are you sure that's what you want? yes. blow out! - hey! get away! blow out! - terry! terry! terry! terry? terry! terry! terry! terry! watch out! jan! - go get... call a medic! - medic! i don't know what kind of condition. i think it's very serious though. i don't know what on earth... it's jan. there's been an accident on the rig. jan, can you hear me? oh. what are you doing? i'm holding your hand. don't touch me. - don't touch me! - jan, relax. just take... sit down here. okay? that's it. that's it. you all right? you all right? shh. deep breath. come on. hello. talk to me, darling. talk to me. talk to me. come on. oh, come on. it's all right. it's gonna be all right. uh, they're gonna operate straightaway. it'll be a few hours, so i think we better wait... bess. bess, you can't go in there. - i want to be with him. - it's not allowed. i know you do. i know, but come on. come with me. no, i want to see him all the time. bess, it's not a good idea. - come on. - bess. bess. please. you can't stay here. it's just not possible. bess. can i have a word with you? stay there, all right? don't move. i want you to pray with me. - what? - please. dear god... we pray that you will hold your hand over jan... and not let him die. amen. mrs. nyman, will you please come with me? will he live? we have stabilized your husband's condition for the time being. will he live? yes. yes, bess. he will live. your husband suffered very serious injuries. life shouldn't always be preserved at any cost. what do you mean? um, well, the doctor means, bess, that... um, sometimes... in some cases, when life isn't worth living... then it may be better to die. you don't know jan... or you could not say such a thing. your husband may never walk again. we think he'll be completely paralyzed. but he'll live. yes. he will live, it seems. father... are you there? are you still there? of course i am, bess. you know that. what's happening? you wanted jan home. i've changed my mind. why... why did i ask for that? because you're a stupid little girl, bess. i had to test you. your love for jan has been put to the test. thank you for not letting him die. you're welcome, bess. v(tm)ie she said there is no reason v(tm)ie v(tm)ie and the truth is plain to see v(tm)ie v(tm)ie but i wandered through my playing cards v(tm)ie v(tm)ie and would not let her be v(tm)ie v(tm)ie one of 16 vestal virgins v(tm)ie v(tm)ie who were leaving for the coast v(tm)ie v(tm)ie and although my eyes were open v(tm)ie v(tm)ie they might just as well have been closed v(tm)ie v(tm)ie and so it was v(tm)ie and i would say to you... that if there is one of these commandments... which you do not love... and do not obey... you have no place at the lord's table. - when did you get back? - i came back with jan. oh. it's nice to see you. - ta-da! - surf's up! - hi. - hi, guys. - how you doing, bud? - i'm fine. how are you? okay. did you find anything? gas. nothing really. guess what now. we're heading up north. - well, north, that's good. - that's where you always said the oil was. what are you doing here anyway? we're meant to be out drilling. i... just felt like putting my feet up for a while. wouldn't trust you two guys out there alone. well, my... my arms aren't okay, so... i'm not thirsty anyway. bullshit! here. come on. come on. oh, man. sorry. - oh, man. sorry. - thank you. thank you. i'm not really supposed to have any visitors, so... we really don't have the time either. - okay. - okay. - you take care of yourself, huh? - take care. get well soon. see you, guys. will you do something for me? yes? the next time you come, could you wear something more... more loose? so i, uh... so i won't have to see your body. bess, you'll have to go now, 'cause jan needs to rest. all right? you shouldn't get him too overemotional, you know. it's not good for him. i'm sorry. you got to cheer him up. is he asleep now? well, he should be, with the amount i've given him. would it be all right if i went and had a look at him? i love you, jan. i love you too, bess. you are the love of my life. bess. where have you been? i've been to the church. what, at 2:00 in the morning? i don't want you getting ill again... like you did when sam died. - i said i've been to the church. - it's nothin' to do with the church. did you hear what i said? did you? i don't want you to get ill again like you did when sam died. i've had a word with dr. richardson. all right? and... and he says he could see you tomorrow. oh, can he? bess, would you like to come in? dodo said i had to come. she has this idea about me treating you. my predecessor admitted you a few years ago. uh, wh... why did he do that? i don't know. no, nor do i. you were upset because your brother had died, and... now you're upset because your husband's ill. nothing unusual about that. am i not going to have some pills? i'm probably not like your old doctor. i don't think that people should be given pills... just because they do what's only natural. maybe showing what you feel isn't the done thing from where you come from... but it's certainly no disease. what happened on the rig was my fault. how come? i prayed to god to send him home. wow. wow. what powers you possess. come on. do you really... do you really believe that you possess such powers? i know you people believe a lot about yourselves. bess... perhaps you should do a bit of grieving for yourself instead of him. i think you should come and see me now and again if you feel like it. i'm sorry. oh. come on. things will pick up once he gets home again. v(tm)ie well, she's my woman of gold v(tm)ie v(tm)ie and she's not very old, a-a-ha v(tm)ie v(tm)ie well, she's my woman of gold v(tm)ie v(tm)ie and she's not very old, a-a-ha v(tm)ie v(tm)ie i don't mean to be bold, but may i hold your hand? v(tm)ie v(tm)ie well, she ain't no witch v(tm)ie v(tm)ie and i love the way she twitch, a-a-ha v(tm)ie v(tm)ie well, she ain't no witch v(tm)ie v(tm)ie and i love the way she twitch a-a-ha v(tm)ie v(tm)ie happy birthday to you v(tm)ie v(tm)ie squashed tomatoes and stew v(tm)ie v(tm)ie you look like a monkey v(tm)ie v(tm)ie and we thought it was you v(tm)ie look at that. special. shall i open your present? yes. - lovely. - present. can you see all right? what is it? wait and see. i don't believe it. where did you get that? - i got it in a shop. - that is... that is the stupidest thing i've ever seen. oh, look. it's not doing anything now. all right. go on. well, go on. that is just terrible. how daft that is. completely daft. just like... happy birthday, jan. thank you. i'll see you later. do you like it? oh, yes. it's... it's w... it's nice. i'll give you your pill. okay? oh. one more drink. okay? yeah. it went down. thank you. happy birthday. i'm finished, bess. no. you could take a lover without anybody noticing. but you can't divorce me. they'd never let you. - bess. - no. no. is that what you think i want? you cripple! you must make up with him. a husband and wife have to be able to talk to each other. he's the one who is helpless... and you're the one who must show you're strong. go to him, and tell him you are sorry you were angry. you have god. you have the strength your life in god has bestowed upon you. and that is a strength he does not possess. oh, no. come on. come on, love. be all right. that's it. come on. that's it. that's it. it's all right, all right, all right. don't know what she's thinking of... going off leaving you like this. you must admit that she was... she was happy when we got married. she blossomed... didn't she? i can't just lie here. i can't even make love to her. she's gotta get out of here. she's gotta get on with life. help me set her free. she'd do anything for you, jan. you know that. she doesn't care anything about herself. but she'd do anything for you. just to see a smile on your face. do you understand me? yeah. right. thanks for telling me. no trouble. do you want me to read to you? hmm? are you all right? they took him back to the hospital. bess. bess, what is going on? - what happened? is he... - he went unconscious. we had to bring him back here. we can't have him at home anymore... not if you're gonna go running off and leaving him like that. - i'm sorry. - well, it's just not good enough. i'm not... i'm not even allowed to kiss him anymore. why don't you try listening to what he says, bess? it's up to you. he hasn't got anyone else. you could give him the will to live. it's more than any doctor could do. bess? i'm sorry. no, it was my fault. come here. hi. hi. love is a mighty power... isn't it? if i'll die... it will be because love cannot keep me alive. but i can hardly remember what it's like to make love... and if i forget that, then i'll die. remember when i phoned you from the rig... and we made love without being together? do you want me to talk to you like that again? i-i'd love to. bess... i want you to find a man... to make love to... and then come back here and tell me about it. it will feel like you and me being together again. now, that... that will keep me alive. i... i can't. this morning when i... when i told you to... to get a lover... it wasn't for your sake. it was for my sake. because i don't want to die. i'm afraid. you understand? yes. it will be you and me, bess. do it for me. i... i can't. please? bess? are you all right? sure? here you go. whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. easy. v(tm)ie suzanne takes you down v(tm)ie v(tm)ie to her place near the river v(tm)ie v(tm)ie you can hear the boats go by v(tm)ie v(tm)ie you can spend the night beside her v(tm)ie v(tm)ie and you know that she's half crazy v(tm)ie v(tm)ie but that's why you want to be there v(tm)ie v(tm)ie and she feeds you tea and oranges v(tm)ie v(tm)ie that come all the way from china v(tm)ie v(tm)ie and just when you mean to tell her v(tm)ie v(tm)ie that you have no love to give her v(tm)ie v(tm)ie then she gets you on her wavelength v(tm)ie v(tm)ie and she lets the river answer v(tm)ie v(tm)ie that you've always been her lover v(tm)ie you certainly needed some shut-eye. i put your rose in a vase. think it's perked up a bit. you should think of yourself a bit too. go out. go dancing. i've seen you dance. you like to dance. where is jan? there's nothing you can do in here. don't let him die. and why shouldn't i let him die? i love him. so you keep saying, but i don't see it. there's nothing i can do. there's nothing at all. prove to me that you love him... and then i'll let him live. i've come to dance. it's great. you're great. great movement. but maybe you could talk to me? v(tm)ie and love lies bleeding in my hand v(tm)ie v(tm)ie oh, it kills me to think of you v(tm)ie v(tm)ie with another man v(tm)ie bess, stop dancing. talk to me. v(tm)ie but my guitar couldn't hold you, so i split the band v(tm)ie - bess. - v(tm)ie love lies bleeding v(tm)ie - talk to me. - v(tm)ie in my hand v(tm)ie give me five minutes. you can touch me now. you can have me now. bess, listen to me. we're not going to make love. now put your clothes back on. don't you want me? don't you like me? you said that you liked me. yes, bess, i like you. now put your clothes on. you don't understand. i'll... i'll be good to you and... i want us to make love. listen, um, bess... if you want to talk to me... we can meet at the hospital, all right? now please just... put your clothes on, bess. please. i don't know what to do with you. all right now, just... put your clothes on, bess, and go home. no. i'm lying on my back... all naked... and... he comes in and he sees me... and... he kisses my breasts. um... and he enters me... um... and... he's making love to me... gently... and... he's coming. it was dr. richardson. hi. - hi, bess. - hi, bess. where you going then? uh, i've got to go to the church. oh. jan, we're gonna take you off the respirator for five minutes... to exercise your lungs a little bit and see how you are. so just relax and take it easy. okay, start to breathe by yourself now, jan. just take very deep breaths. slowly. that's it. and again. very good. deep breaths. that's it. bess. yes? what are you doing on this bus? which bus, jan? come to me. come. i'm here. i'm here in the back. yes? - in the back of the bus. - yes. come. dodo? - dodo. - hang on. jan. go and get dr. richardson. i'm gonna put you back on the respirator now, jan. jan, can you hear me? are you awake? talk to me. hi, bess. i'd like to have a chat with you. - bess? - mmm. this is my bus. this is my bus. forgive me, father. i have sinned. mary magdalene sinned... and she's among my dearly beloved. i go to the back of the bus... and you're there. and you're so huge... that you're almost bursting out of your pants. and i undo your fly... and i touch you. i'm touching your prick. have you been in to see jan? - how is he? - better. - he's better? - just a bit. hey, bess, it looks like your prayers have been answered. we've been able to take him off the respirator. good news, isn't it? do you think... that we turn to different people... when we get close to the edge? and that we, um... we turn bad... when we're going to die? you're not going to die. i know you're not. i promise you. v(tm)ie when are you gonna come down? v(tm)ie v(tm)ie when are you going to land? v(tm)ie v(tm)ie i should have stayed on the farm v(tm)ie v(tm)ie i should have listened to my old man v(tm)ie v(tm)ie you know you can't hold me forever v(tm)ie v(tm)ie i didn't sign up with you v(tm)ie v(tm)ie i'm not a present for your friends to open v(tm)ie v(tm)ie this boy's too young to be singing v(tm)ie v(tm)ie the blues v(tm)ie ooh, look. here you go. hey, hey, girlies! we found some shroomies! don't get your hopes up too high, will you? dr. richardson says that jan could get worse again. i'm the one who saved his life. i can save it again. bess. what are you talking about? i told jan stories. stories about love. that was almost like being together, him and me. you see, love can save jan. he must not forget about love. he told me that. he tells me what to do. bess, i'm glad that you listen to jan... but don't let him gain too much power over you. sickness is a mighty power. you know that. i've saved jan. don't talk like that. it's stupid! you always said that i wasn't stupid. well, you're stupid if you say things like that. why are you saying i'm stupid now? because i can see that you're disappearing... into a world of make-believe... and it worries me. i used to go mad when people called you stupid, but... you are stupid! we're gonna put a drain in this afternoon. just wait and see. it'll be much easier to get through to him. don't worry. it's a very minor operation. are you trying to make me feel guilty? what makes you say that? i think she's trying to make me feel guilty. come here. you look fucking awful. why do you dress like that? you dress like a widow. i'm not even dead yet. maybe you wish i was. no! no, no. you haven't done what i asked you to. i have! i asked you to be with a man. i... i have done that. you call that being with a man? i call it a joke. i love you. i don't love some other man. prove it. bess. what is going on? are you sleeping with other men to feed his sick fantasies? he did get better. no, he did not get better. that's just the way it goes. sometimes he's better, sometimes he's worse. nothing to do with what you're doing. that's all in your mind. he is my husband... and god has said that i must honor him. well, if that's what honoring is all about... then i must have something wrong. well, you don't come from around here, do you? no, and i'm glad i don't. the way the locals talk, it makes me sick. but you live here and you go to the church. yes, but that don't mean i don't look at things me own way. why don't you move then? your husband's dead. you know very well why i don't move. i don't move because of you. a woman has to choose for herself, bess. she has to have a mind of her own. now, what you're doing is... making things worse. it's... nonsense. his... his head's full of scars. he's up to his eyeballs in drugs. he doesn't know what he's saying. and he doesn't know. i'm sorry. i'm sorry. am i going to go to hell? whom do you want to save? yourself or jan? bess? it's been a long time. most unlike you. i must warn you that the lord looks with anger upon those who fail him. you've got to lend me something to wear. he's never gonna beat me. you're low man. all right, all right. hello. how much, darlin'? one, two, three. thank you. okay. i can't hear the blood pressure. i can't hear the blood pressure. we have a fibrillation. clear. - shit. - no, there's no change. okay. clear. - clear again, please. - clear. come on. clear, please. all right. yes. good. good work. good work. it's okay. hi, bess. bess? bess. think it's time we had a little chat. i love you, no matter what is in your head. so you didn't have to give jan electric shock treatment... when his heart stopped in the operation yesterday? no, we didn't. it was a perfectly simple operation. it went very well. as you know. i shouldn't have to say that. you know that very well. i want a word with bess on her own. thank you, dorothy. i'm not going to ask you what you've been getting up to... 'cause i don't want to hear you lie to me. but as long as you are living under my roof... you are to behave like a decent human being. i've never lied to you. do you understand me? yes, mother. this is very painful for me. your grandfather can no longer hold his hand over you... with the elders. i don't think you realize what that means. have you any idea what it's like to be cast out? you will have nothing, bess. i have known strong men and women... wither away after being cast out. now, you are not strong. you're a feeble girl. it would kill you, bess. i've said enough. bess? bess. could you come down a minute, love? dr. richardson is here. hi, bess. hello. well, how are you? can we sit down? mmm. bess. i th... i think you've got yourself involved... in something which is out of your control. have i? come on, bess. you're not a kid anymore. look, for christ's sake, he's... he's forcing you to get screwed by every tom, dick and harry. it's just not you. i don't make love with them. i make love with jan... and i save him from dying. well, i'm sorry, but, you know... to me he seems more like a dirty old man who wants to play the peeping tom. sometimes... i don't even have to tell him about it. jan and me... we have a spiritual contact. god gives everyone something to be good at. i've always been stupid... but i'm good at this. god gives everyone a talent. what's jan's talent? he is... he's a great lover. well, what's... what's mine, then? i don't know. haven't you found it yet? i see. and what's your talent then, bess? because, um, surely it can't be... being screwed by men you've never seen before. i can believe. are you angry now? yes, i'm... yeah, yeah, yeah, i am angry... because you can't see that he's messing you about. he's the one who's sick. look, what he's doing to you is sick... and it's getting sicker and sicker. he's becoming more and more of a danger to you the more the fluid rises in his... listen to me, for god's sake! do you always get so involved... in your patients' problems, dr. richardson? listen to me, bess. i care for you. i love you, bess. you're very special. will you move your hands, please. dodo. will you show dr. richardson out, please? what's... what's gonna happen now then, bess? um... has he told you any more of the thoughts he's had... any more services for you to perform? don't come here again. oh, he has, has he? what's it gonna be this time? what are you gonna give him to slobber over this time? dear father... what's going on? father? where are you? we just don't want to wait for someone like that. hello. can you take me out to the ships? can't take you out there. the other girls wouldn't like it. they can't do all the ships. they don't have time. maybe not. well, what about the big one? i don't go out to that one anymore. the girls won't go aboard. well, then you can take me, and no harm done. how are you feeling, jan? well... i've felt better. yeah. yeah. unfortunately, the periods in which we can get through to you... have lately become very rare. i have to send you back to glasgow for a while, i'm afraid. i don't want any more... operations. of course, it's entirely up to you, but... i have to say that your condition is unlikely to improve without surgery. well, if you've made your mind up on that point... maybe it's time to consider other matters. i mean, we should start thinking about other people than just you. bess? i'm glad you understand what i'm driving at. your... your condition... has been... has been very hard on her. i can't judge why, but she's... she's suffering from delusions regarding your condition. i have to be blunt. i don't think that seeing you is good for her. i guess not. and i'm convinced that the best thing we can do for her right now... is to admit her again. get her away? yes. as far away as possible. think that's necessary? listen, if you don't want surgery... the indications are that we will enter a prolonged period... in which you will be more and more affected by your condition. the poorlier you are... the more detrimental your influence on bess. i've drawn up some papers giving me the authority to detain her... under the provisions of the mental health act. i'll need your consent. you're going to section bess? it's the only way i can get her treated. tell me, dr. richardson. does this mean i will never see her again? to be realistic, yes. just there at the bottom. you said you wanted to help her. come on, jan. v(tm)ie if you been bad v(tm)ie v(tm)ie lord, i bet you have v(tm)ie v(tm)ie and you've not been hit v(tm)ie v(tm)ie you've not been hit by flying lead v(tm)ie v(tm)ie you'd better close your eyes v(tm)ie v(tm)ie you'd better bow your head v(tm)ie v(tm)ie wait for the ricochet v(tm)ie v(tm)ie ooh-ooh-ooh v(tm)ie v(tm)ie ooh-ooh-ooh v(tm)ie v(tm)ie ooh-ooh-ooh v(tm)ie how do i get back? i'll keep an eye out for you. hello. what do you want? i want that you do it with the sailor and i watch. okay. it's all right. - all right. come here, you. - no. there we go. eh? yeah, that's better. come on now. yeah. that's right. you like this, eh? no. please. can i go home now? no, no. can i go home now, please? - stay still! - no, please. - no, no, please... please, can i go home? - stay still, i said! stay still, i said! stay... god's sake. no! you bitch! i'm going to shoot you! - you will? - i'm gonna shoot you. you think so? you don't even know how to use that thing. nobody will believe a hooker! because there is only one thing for us, sinners that we are... to achieve perfection in the eyes of god... through unconditional love for the word that is written... through unconditional love for the law. i don't understand what you're saying. how can you love... a word? you cannot love words. you cannot be in love with a word. you can love another human being. that's perfection. no woman speaks here! bess mcneill, the kirk session... - has decided this day... - no, let me stay here. that henceforth you shall no longer have access to this kirk. - they who know you shall not know you. - please let me stay! please. no. begone, bess mcneill, from the house of god! hello, bess. you're... you're coming with us. we're going to glasgow. bess, they're going to take you back into hospital just for a little bit. it's for your own good. i want to see jan. i want to see my husband. i know. but not now, bess. it's for your own good, bess. mother can't have me admitted, not now that i'm married. bess, it wasn't mother that signed the paper. it was jan. - you liar! - come along, bess. jan! jan! dodo, how can you do this?

- no. anything at all? yes. i'd like you to go to jan and pray for him to be cured... and to rise from his bed and walk. will you take me to the big ship? again? are you sure? father, why aren't you with me? i am with you, bess. what do you want from me? where were you? well, don't you think i have other people who want to talk to me? oh, of course. i hadn't thought of that. there's this silly little thing called bess... who keeps on wanting me to talk to her... so my work's been piling up a bit. but you're with me now?

did you decide you are going to do two boxes at the same time now? yeah. selma... 1 0:00 then? 1 0:00. what happens at 1 0:00? i'm--i'm gonna do the night shift. the night shift? you can hardly see well enough to do your own shift. it suits me fine. it's just after drama class. you are going to do that, too? i've had my fill of you, selma. you do what you want. go ahead, break your neck. do your night shift, but don't think for one second i'm going to come and rescue you. selma? kathy split already. i'm not looking for kathy. i was looking for you. i just have to go to drama rehearsal. so what do you say? you can always ride your bike. you have it over there. i left it at home. i thought it'd be quicker if i walked. how do you reckon that? i just walk along the railroad tracks. it's a... shortcut. look, i don't understand. in musicals... why do they start to sing and dance all of a sudden? i mean, i don't suddenly start... to sing and dance. no... you're right, jeff. you don't. the last thing on the list is the bake sale. two sundays away. hi, selma. come on in, come on in. i'm gonna introduce you to your understudy. my understudy? yeah. this girl suzan, who boris knows, is a good singer. she's a good dancer. she'll learn your part, too, because, say, you get a cold, and... you can't do it, then the show doesn't have to stop. okay? suzan, selma. selma, suzan. could you take off your glasses? i think we'll do the part without glasses. next sunday, you will see both marias. i mean, selma will do the role, really, but... i'll have you read part of it too. all right? it's your first time on the night shift, right? while this is being pressed, you'll be cutting on the other machine. that means you'll be in charge of two machines. you have to beat sarah over there, right? this pallet must never be empty. is it always so dark in here? what? is it always so dark in here? it's exactly the same as the daytime. oh. okay. the only thing is you have to work a little faster. that's what you're paid for, right? - okay. - okay? thank you. - excuse me. - yeah? you have to work a little, you know, a little faster than this. okay. what are you doing here? what do you think? i didn't put you down for the night shift, kathy. run along, norman. i'm on my own time now. how i spend it is my own business. 'night, ladies! good night! faster. a little faster. i like it better when you dance. you should dance more... cvalda. i will dance when there is music. it's music. now dance. selma! stop that, you've cut yourself! get away from the machine! henry! oh, jeff is here. hello, jeff. hi, kathy. do you live here? thought she might say yes to a ride when it's this late. m-maybe kathy... wants a ride. no, it's all right. what's that, with your hand? she cut her... cut my finger. yeah. it's going to be all right. the plates are sharp. goodnight. careful. i think i found a solution to our problem. that makes me really happy. it's nothing special... but i've made up my mind. i'm gonna tell linda, and, uh... i mean, after all, she loves me, and... we'll just work it out together. that sounds like a really good idea, bill. i'm sorry, i'll let you get to bed. i guess i'm kinda tired. thanks, bill. good night, selma. good night, bill. bill? what's happening now? here we go. selma, are you ready? and... you're on. cut. cut, stop. stop, please. this is selma's entrance, okay? yeah? okay, paul, please. how far do you think it is? i don't know. and... kathy, what are you doing? this is maria's entrance. yes. i'm sorry. my mistake. please, please! i don't have all night! six steps. let's take this a little more seriously. good! okay, i'm thinking maybe, selma... you could take a little sort of circle around boris on this next part, unless you have something else you wanna suggest. i'm open. okay? samuel. yes? i need to talk to you. oh, selma, please, if it's about the drummer, i have been looking everywhere for a drummer-- it's not about the drummer. it's not about the drummer. um... just a quick word. do you wanna go outside? yup. okay. i--i'm not gonna play maria. what? my heart just isn't in this... like, i shouldn't be wasting my time on something... that isn't... that important really. i've been watching suzan, and she's... she's great. she's... she's very-- she's a much better dancer than i am. terrific. suzan's terrific. i'm not denying that, but you--i thought you lived for musicals. so you've been pretending the whole time? yes. i've just been pretending. i don't know what else i could do with you. i've got everything cast right now. yeah. the only part that's left is the old nun who lets maria out of the convent gate. i don't think you'd want that part. there's no dancing in that. she's quite serious then? she's serious. it's important for the part. okay. i'm not dancing really. no. i could put a little bit of dancing in there. you think so? it--i didn't have it in mind. you can have your tapping. she could be just a little... humorous once in a while... even though she's a nun. you'll always be my perfect maria. where are all the hairpins today? i left them at home. and she won't be playing maria. what do you reckon i'm gonna do if i can't bawl you out for learning your lines on company time? one...two... three! what kind of a joke is that? well, she's beating me. i need a word with you. we're talking right now. all right... come on. please sit down. we were off for the whole day. everything stops when the machine breaks. you know that. i--i can do my job just fine... if i stick to the day shift. this won't happen again. look, i daydream too much. i--i decided to quit. and... and i guess, then l--i forgot. i've been ordered to let you go, selma. you're not gonna have to pay for the machine you broke. i got them to agree to that. uh, thanks, norman. this is your salary. and you know, um... maybe we can find you something away from the machines where your eyesight wouldn't matter so much. yeah... not right away. that's very kind of you. i better go. i'll be okay. i really will. thanks, norman. thank you, selma. thank you. what is she going to do now? did you ever think about that? don't worry, kathy. really. i'm gonna be fine. has anybody seen jeff today? he's usually here early, selma, but not this early. it's a shame. selma! selma... i could give you a lift if you want. i--i will need a lift... later. i need to do something important at...at 3:00. well, you need to get your truck then, don't you? yeah. train's coming. get off the track, jeff. you have to be careful. stay to the side. you can't see, can you? what is there to see? you can't see, can you? see you at 3:00. i can see. gene hasn't come back yet. i need to talk to bill. he decided to take the day off to go to the bank for his box. is he--is he upstairs? yeah. i know everything, selma. bill told me. i want you to move out! i--i don't understand. wh-what would you know? that you came on to him. that you asked him into the trailer, but he turned you down! you've got nothing to say for yourself? no. i want to talk to bill. hi, bill. linda saw me go up to the, um... up to the trailer. i told her it was you who wanted to, uh... that you'd... that you'd fallen in love with me. i know. she told me. and what did you tell her? nothing. you didn't tell her i was lying? mum's the word, right? linda told me you went to the bank. i went to the bank to ask for more time. but i couldn't do it. and i brought the box home instead. linda always gets so proud when she sees me sitting in here with it. but you have put my money in it, haven't you?

jeff. what are you doing here? is it already 3:00? uh, not really. hell, i'm always early. you cut yourself again. there's some blood on your blouse. strange. i couldn't feel it at all. selma... we're here now. by the bus stop? yeah, the bus stop. it's over there. and the lake is here? promise me that you won't follow me. promise. yeah, i promise. dobry vecer, pane doktore. dobry vecer. i would like to pay for the operation now. $2,056... and 1 0 cents. i know it's not quite what you told me, but... but it's all i could get together. well. what last name shall i put on the receipt? oh, i don't need a receipt. i really don't. i have to know the name of your son. when he comes in for his operation. novy... he will come, and he will say that his name is novy. and then you will know... that he has been paid for. novy? like oldrich novy, the tap dancer? it is strange, isn't it? but he never really made it over here, did he? i saw his films when i was a kid. he was in the first musical i ever saw. same here. selma? it's tuesday night. what about your rehearsal? yeah, i guess. you want to go? yeah. then maybe put your arm around her, and... a little bit of... hi, selma. hi, samuel. we weren't sure you'd show up, actually. sure, i'd show up. hi. nice to see you. be right back. okay. she's here. yeah. okay. okay. okay, i think--i think you could... try it one more time for me. but i should-- i should be going now. i think gene may wonder where i am. jeff, he--he hasn't seen me all day. i think maybe we could do your scene. let's do the tapping scene. okay? we haven't done it in weeks, and we really need to rehearse it, and while you're here, we might as well take advantage of the time, please? okay, let's do the tapping scene. you come offstage-- let me have the nuns up there. imagi-- you're going to do selma's part for her for right now, all right? you like it? yes. we haven't done it for a while. remember that part we did where-- where you, uh... you come to the convent gate to say goodbye to the--to maria? i should leave, jeff. what? gene--gene is probably worried now. i haven't seen him all day. all right. i'm sorry, samuel, but... betty, come here for a second, please. the drummer that you wanted-- remember, you asked me for a drummer? i found somebody. she's fantastic. her name's betty. she's right here for the first time tonight. please meet her. selma, this is betty. hi, betty. you play the drums? yeah. tell her how long you've been studying. two years. she's wonderful. you've got to stay and enjoy this. you've got to-- i have an idea. let's do the finale. i just remembered, you hate finales. no finale! i've a better idea. ""climb every mountain,"" part one. the state will show that the defendant has not only perpetrated the most callous... and well-planned homicide in recent memory... but is also a fundamentally selfish individual... who cynically hides behind a handicap, devoid of sympathy for anybody but herself. this woman found trust and friendship when she sought refuge in our country, and the evidence will show that she has repaid such kindness with betrayal, robbery, and murder, inflicted upon the very people who opened their homes and hearts to her. ladies and gentlemen of the jury... the evidence will prove that she herself... did not show that mercy she will ask of us. is this the bag here, detective? yes, the very same. houston's blood was all over it. well, shortly before the homicide, i had a checkup on her vision, and i found that she was myopic. it's nearsighted-- nearsighted, but... she could see. yes. she said communism was... better for human beings. she had nothing but contempt for our great country and its principles? apart from its musicals. she said the american one... the american ones were better. so... the defendant preferred hollywood to vladivostok. i suppose that's an acknowledgement of sorts. she just asked many times about the money. she wanted to know where it was? that's right. she asked you about the gun? yes, she did. she wanted to know where it was kept? that's right. bill was lying on the floor and... he was wounded. and... and... he was pleading for his life? yes. ""i--i beg you, i beg you, i beg you."" you showed him no mercy, selma! you shall have no mercy either! would you state your name for the record, please? selma jezkova. and bill and linda houston... were your friends, is that right? yeah. in fact, you lived in a trailer on their property. yeah. and didn't they also take care of your young son when you were at work? yeah. they bought him a... birthday present recently. is that right? yeah. they got him a bike. right. your sight was poor, you claim, contrary to the expert testimony we have received. but you saw well enough to inflict 34 wounds on bill houston. so why did you kill him, actually? if i may be so bold to ask? he asked me to. he did? how intriguing. a man with a fine career and some wealth, a happy marriage, why would this bill houston ask you to kill him? i promised not to say. well, that clears things up immensely. you promised you wouldn't say. in that case, we'll just have to take your word for it when you say that the money you stole that bill houston's savings also disappeared so mysteriously that same day. just, uh... just where did you get your money? well... i'd been saving up. well, i suppose you could call it that. what were these savings to be used for? you never bought your son so much as a single birthday present, as we've heard. yes? my--my father. in czechoslovakia. your father? and what, pray tell... is his name? my--my father is... oldrich novy. so... we're meant to believe... that you killed bill houston by inflicting 34 wounds on him because... he asked you to. just as we're meant to believe that you were blind when you did it... are meant to believe that it was your own savings that you stole from him... just as we're meant to believe that you sent all you had to your father back home, a man by the name of oldrich novy. is that right? yes. thank you, miss jezkova. ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've now heard from the defendant's own lips. you must believe her, just as you must believe her when she claims her father's name is oldrich novy. your honor... at this time, the state calls to the witness stand... oldrich novy. please state your full name. the name is oldrich novy. and you used to live in czechoslovakia? that is right. i live now in california, as you know. that's right, that's where we found you. what exactly is your relationship with the defendant? i do not know her. you don't know her? so... you have not received money from her. money that--that... she says was so dearly earned? no, i have not. perhaps you're not her father then? no, i am not. well, if this relationship was made up by the defendant, then... can you think of any way she might've come to know your name? i was once well known in czechoslovakia uh... because of my profession. yes, mr. oldrich novy, what is your profession? maybe that can give us a clue to why, why this somewhat... romantic, certainly communistic, woman who worships fred astaire but not his country, why she might've lied... and misused your name... to make us think all her money was spent on a poor father and not on her own vanity. what is it that you do? i was an actor. i made films. they were musicals. say it again! will the court please rise? the honorable judge a.d. mantle presiding. have you reached a verdict? yes, your honor. will the defendant please rise? we, the jury, find the defendant selma jezkova guilty of murder in the first degree and hereby sentence her to death. is this the verdict of this jury? you fully understand that it must be unanimous? we do, your honor. selma jezkova... you are hereby sentenced to be taken from this place and confined in the state penitentiary until such time as you shall be executed by being hanged by the neck until you are dead. this court is adjourned. all rise! i've just heard about the... supreme court decision. yeah, l... i just want to talk practical stuff. on gene's birthday... he will receive a letter. and it's so important, kathy... that he reads it really carefully. i need you to take care of that for me... because i'm not gonna be there when he gets it. he should not be afraid, because there's nothing to be afraid of, kathy. listen, gene wants to see you so badly. won't you let him? please? there's nothing for him to see. he's got you now, kathy. and there's one more thing: he has to call himself novy. that's very important. all right, time's up, selma. i know that sounds a bit foolish. novy? i'm sorry i didn't tell you before about all this. i just didn't dare to because they would ruin everything. but what-- why does he have to call himself novy? stop asking questions like that, cvalda. please... iet me tell gene hello... from you to him. no. i know you love your son very much. i love him very much. got a boy of my own back home. you never told me that. good night, brenda. good night. say hi to your son from me. thank you, selma. can i help you? did you once have a patient called... jezkova... selma jezkova? well, if it wasn't too long ago, i can check my records for you. jes... jez... jess... sorry, there's no one here by that name. what about novy? i have good news for you. what's that? we found a new lawyer... and he's going to get your case re-opened. he says your lawyer was incompetent. what do you mean? well, the case is going to be re-opened. you won't get the death sentence. is that true? yes. new information has turned up. wh-what information? well, we know the whole story, selma. why didn't you tell us anything? you know, about... about the money for gene's operation. how did you find out? well, jeff talked to the doctor. does--does gene know? i mean, have you told gene? no. no, i didn't. but you've got a much better case now. that's very important, kathy. his eyes might get worse from worrying, and then the operation won't work. yes, but, selma... don't you see that it would help you if they knew that you were trying to save your son from going blind? the lawyer, he'll come and see you in two weeks' time. kathy, but, uh... you know they're hanging me in one week. we know that, but he says you can apply for a stay. you know, most cases get one the first time. well, you can smile. selma... yeah... it's just too much for me. i thought i was strong. i just can't take it, kathy. apply for a stay. what if they don't phone? uh, well, you'll be transferred to the other... cell block at some point tomorrow. that's the cell block where they hang people. yeah, that's where they... spend the last day. and then they do their 1 07 steps. it's from that room... to the gallows, isn't it? that's what they say, selma, but... look at... you're gonna get your stay. why don't you try to think of something nice, all right? it's just so quiet here. what's that got to do with it, selma? you know, when i used to work in the factory... i used to dream that i was in a musical, because, in a musical, nothing dreadful ever happens. but it's so quiet here. don't the prisoners march or something? march? no. yeah? no, they don't. they don't... there's not... there's not much noise around here, selma, i know. but later they turn on the radio. no, no, no. there's no... they don't allow radio in the isolation block. but i've been listening to the ventilation... shaft. i hear sometimes people singing there, iike... hymns or... that's not against the rules, to listen, is it? no. i wonder if... if maybe you're hearing the singing coming from the chapel. yeah? maybe you'll even get a sermon. selma... selma... you got your stay. you got the stay. i'm so happy for you. i'm your new legal counsel. my name is luke, okay? oh, hi, luke. i'm, uh, quite sure... i can get your sentence commuted. all i need is a signature stating you want the case re-opened... and then i can get all the paperwork ready by tomorrow. yeah. there's a lot of things your other lawyer didn't do that i'm going to do. a lot of ground that wasn't covered that i am going to cover. the fact that you were fighting for your boy is something we can really milk. i have some experience in cases like this, so... that's what the attorney before said. uh... yeah. you see, he was appointed by the court, and you don't get the best legal counsel that way. y-you were not appointed by the court? i'm not appointed by the court, no. you're gonna have to pay me. but... not to worry. yeah? that's been taken care of. i made a deal with your... iady friend? deal? yeah, in regard to my fee. i've agreed to accept the amount that she said she could raise. how much... how much was it? well, i can tell you precisely, because i received an envelope. it's, uh, two thousand dollars-- $2,056.1 0? that's it precisely. now... there's something here. i'd like to just sort of go over our tactics. i have a couple of questions to ask you. if he doesn't have the operation next month, it's gonna be too late! and he will never be able to see! this is what it's all about, so he can see his grandchildren! well, let me tell you something. the only thing that's important to me in my whole life, and you don't understand, kathy! - listen to me! - it's just plain stupidity! - listen to me! - waste that kind of money... on a blind woman who's gonna spend the rest of her life in jail! but he needs his mother, you know, alive, no matter where! you don't understand! he needs his eyes! - he needs his mother! - no! - yes! alive! - no! listen to reason for once! selma. selma. i listen to my heart. i will go to the police. i will tell them that... you stole the money from... from bill. oh, yes, i will tell that. i will tell them that, that you stole it from bill, and you will never see the money again! that will be gone for good. no operation! nothing! no mother! nothing! you can have your money back. i just want to make sure that you fully comprehend what this means, this decision. yeah. you fully realize what will happen? yeah. i already asked for no more stays. once this starts, there's no stopping it. you understand me? yeah. i'm prepared. gene says thank you. thanks for what? oh, some comic books on his birthday. you can't buy him... presents and say it's from me. you have to stop doing that, jeff. uh, maybe you can just... phone him. just say, you know... something to him. no, that's--that's not a good idea. he wants to be the one... who's allowed to be there when it happens. but l-- and then they told him he's too young. who put that crazy idea into his head anyway? i don't want him to be there. i'll be there if you would. and kathy? you know kathy. she's... she's still angry. if you think you can take it... i would love you to be there. don't cry, jeff. jeff, don't cry. it's gonna be fine. jeff. why did you have him? you knew he would have the same disease as you. i just wanted to hold a little baby... just in my arms. i love you. it's time, selma. okay? okay. your meal, jezkova. selma jezkova... it's time. please stand. she can walk on her own. selma... i'm afraid my legs aren't working very well. you can do it, selma. yeah. i have a plan, okay? yeah. you're gonna stand up with me. yeah. i may make some noise. it will give you something to listen to. yeah. listen. there's 1 07 steps. selma, listen to the mark. i couldn't even do one. you can do it. i can't do it! now listen, selma. i want you to do one--there, one. come on. listen. two. three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten... 11 ... 12... 13... 14... 15... 16... 17... 18... 19... 20... 21 ... 22... 23... 24... 25... 26... 27... 28... 29... 30... 39... 40... 43... 44... 45... 55... 56... 60... 61 ... 62... 70... 71 ... 72... 75... 76... 77... 93... 94... 95... 104... 105... 106... 107. selma jezkova, do you have any last words?

he will see his grandchildren! he is just outside. you were right, selma!"
Von Trier,Dogville,"dogville was in the rocky mountains in the us of a. up here where the road came to its definiteve end near the entrance to the old, abandoned silver mine. the residents of dogville were good, honest folks and they liked their township. and while a sentimental soul from the east coast had once dubbed their main street elm street, though no elm tree had ever cast its shadow in dogville, they saw no reason to change anything. most of the buildings were pretty wretched; more like shacks; frankly. the house in which tome lived was the best, though, and in good times might almost have passed for presentable. that afternoon the radio was playing softly, for in his dotage thomas edison senior had developed a weakness for music of the lighter kind. ladies and gentlemen... the president of the united states... tom, do me a favor, will you? the radio!? just because the music's over and you might risk hearing something useful? i thought that's why we have the radio... well, i need a rest, as you know. mock me if you like. tom's father had been a doctor and now received a modest pension, so it was no great disaster for tom to drift about not doing anything in particular. tom was a writer. ...at any rate by his own lights. oh, his output as committed to paper was so far limited to the words ""great"" and ""small"", followed by question mark, but nevertheless meticulously archived in one of his many bureau drawers. 'bye, dad. evenin' master tom. good evening, master olivia. don't forget about the meeting tomorrow. noooo in order to postpone the time at which he would have to put pen to pater in earnest, tom had now come up with a series of meetings on moral rearmament with which he felt obliged to benefit the town. - hi, kids. - hi, tom. good evening chuck. will we see you at the meeting tomorrow? well, i could do without your lectures. you know vera. wouldn't give me moment's peace till i said yes. who gave moses that bone? it's still got meat on it. jason did. jason gave that mutt a bone with meat on it? when did we last see meat? next time you waste good food, i'll take your knife away. i would know it was you give'n meat to eat. moses was meant to be hungry! to keep watch. keep watch in dogville? what's there to steal? these are wicked time, tom edison. soon there'll be folks by with even less than us. indeed..tom was busy enough, even though, formally speaking, not yet busy with writing per se. and if a body found it hard to grasp what profession he was busy at, he'd merely reply ""mining"". for although he did not blast his way through rock, he blasted through what was even harder... namely, the human soul... right into where it glistered! - hey, martha. - hello, tom. listen, they're all comin', so you just have those benches ready. yes, they're ready. oh, but tom, i repeat, if you need to use my organ i got to get special permission from the regional director, tom. martha, and i repeat, we don't need the organ. we can be spiritual without singing or reading from the bible. it's almost seven. don't forget your bell now. i imagine that'll do ma ginger. i don't think it's good for the soil with all the raking and hoeing. it's the soil that gave life to us all. don't give me any of your lip, thomas edison jr. i'll hoe as i darn well please! yeah, and spoil the whole thing! i agree with tom. yeah, well he likes eating my pies, don't you? well they're tasty. no doubt about it. yeah. so when it comes to hoeing, who's right, tom, you or me? i'm not so sure it's that simple. he's got you there ginger. you can not resist, can you, gloria? hey, ben, i'll get the doors! i'll be fine, tom. any news from the freight industry? is everything going to hell there too? don't poke fun at the freight industry. it was seven o'clock precisely, as martha chimed the hour, and tom was due to play checkers with his childhood friend bill henson. bill was dumb and knew it. far too dumb to qualify as an engineer, he was certainly sure of that. after listening for a while to the piledriver down the valley that ben insisted was working on the foundation of a new penitentiary, tom headed for the henson home in order to inflict upon bill yet another humiliating defeat at checkers. some folks might say the opportunity to meet bill's older sister, liz, was more of a draw than the checkerboard, and they might be right. it was a fact that in the henson home lay another horizon. a horizon just as alluring as the one beyond the valley. a horizon bound by liz henson's luscious curves. - no one's getting it? - a sweet, painful, seductive abyss. - hey, liz. - hey, tom. must you come by every single day? huh!? it'd be a lot more fun if someone interesting appeared for a change. you know i really am so lonesome in this town. the moment my fiancee writes that he's gotten that job in bolder, i'm off. then the whole lot of you will have to find some other girls' skirts to peek up. is.. uh.. bill in? well, isn't he always? he studies and i help out with the glasses. even though everybody knows that i'm the clever one. - hey, mrs. henson. - good evening, tom. checkers time, bill ol' buddy. was that..?? you didn't hear the bell? as usual bill tried to fake his way around actually playing. he had not yet fully comprehend this meeting business, he claimed. maybe you should just let them be? i don't think so... i... i... what if they're just fine as they are? you think they're fine? i don't think so. i think there is a lot this country has forgotten. i just try and refresh folk's memory by way of illustration. so... so the illustration for tomorrow? mmmh.. i don't know. see if the people of dogville have a problem with the acceptance. what they really need is something for them to accept, something tangible, like a gift. why in the heck would someone up and give us a gift? i don't know. i might have to do some thinking. wait, wait, .. the ... we're missing a piece. we won't be able to play. my mind is sharp tonight. 'night, bill. despite considerable effort on his part to prolong things, tom had achieved the triumph at the checkerboard pretty quickly. it had started to rain and the wind had become a regular gale when tom strolled home through elm street. if tom were to prove that the citizens of dogville had a problem receiving in his lecture in the next day he sorely lacked an illustration, a gift. bill might have been right. it hadn't exactly rained gifts on this particular township. there was no doubt in his mind. they were gun shots. the pile driver in the marshes didn't sound like that at all. the shots had come from down in the valley, or perhaps from canyon road some place in the direction of georgetown. he listened for more shots for ages. but they were not repeated. a tad disappointed, tom sat down on the old lady's bench to think, to hang onto the feeling of danger for a moment. but it wasn't long before his thoughts were back on his favorite subjects again, and in the midst of the storm they metamorphosed into articles and novels and great gatherings that'd listen in silence to tom after the publication of yet another volume that scourged and purged the human soul. and he saw men, and among them even other writers, throw their arms round one another as, through his words, life had opened up for them anew. it hadn't been easy. but by his diligence and application to narrative and drama his message had gotten through, and asked about his technique he would have to say but one word: ""illustration"". tom could have spent another half hour or more on the bench, but another unusual noise roused him. it was moses barking. oh, that wasn't unusual in itself, but it was the way he barked that was new. his barking was not loud, but more of a snarl, as if the danger was quite close at hand and not merely a passing raccoon or fox. as if the dog were standing face to face with a force to be taken seriously. hey, lady! i wouldn't go up there if i were you. i know the mountain well, i doubt if i'd get away with my life. it's a very nasty drop. is there another way? yeah. where? back down the way you came from. back down to georgetown. why do you need to get out of the mountain? did you have anything to do with those gunshots? help me, help me please. you can hide in the mine, in there! hey, where's this road headed to? no where. it's a dead end. if you want to pass, turn around, go back by way of georgetown. this place... uh.. it's called dogville. dogville? well it figures, it's a stupid name if i ever heard one. hey, we're looking for somebody... oh, really, who might that be? my boss wants to talk to ya. - young man. - yes, sir. i'm looking for a girl. she may have made her way to your town in her confusion. i don't want any harm to come to her. you see, she's very precious to me. well sir, uh.. nobody's been through dogville recently. moses would have barked. he's very suspicious of strangers. ah ha.. that's very wise moses. please take my card and if perhaps.. uh.. you see a stranger, give me a call. i am in a position to offer a considerable reward. yes sir. thank you. uh.. say was it you that fired those shots? well they're gone. you want to come out now? you want a cup of coffee before you go mountain-climbing? that would be nice. the beautiful fugitive's name was grace. she hadn't chosen dogville from a map or sought out the township for a visit, yet tom felt right away that she belonged. shall i take the bone? she could have kept her vulnerability to herself, but she had elected to give herself up to him at random. as.. yes.. a gift. ""generous, very generous"", thought tom. you want to eat? you must be hungry? i can't. i don't deserve that bread! i stole that bone. i haven't stolen anything before. so now, now i have to punish myself. i was raised to be arrogant, so i had to teach myself these things. well, it may be best for your education... grace, in this town in these times... it is very impolite not to eat what's set before you. i'm so sorry. who were the men in the car? why would they want to hurt you? the man in the back of the car, he's the boss. i saw his face. he gave me his telephone number, told me to call if i saw you. i'm sure he'd offered you a big reward if you told him where i was. yeah. where's your family? i don't have a family. all i had was a father... but those gangsters took him away from me. what if i said you could stay here? here? but even if you meant it, it's impossible. it's very small town, i have to hide. people will ask questions. well, it might not matter. not if they all wanted to help you too. are you saying that everybody in this town is like you? they're good people. you know, they're honest people. they've all been in need themselves. they might well turn you down, but... i think it would be worth the trouble to ask. but i got nothing to offer them in return. no, i think you have plenty to offer dogville. to call the mood of the audience at tom's morale lecture in the mission house the next day, ""enthusiastic"" would have been going to far, but they had come. and tom had launched himself fearlessly into his endeavor to illustrate the human problem: to receive. the subject was obvious, but quite dreadfully ill-considered by this young man. to compensate for his lack of preparation tom made diligent use of his technique of lashing out somewhat haphazardly in all directions. his father peered around covertly to gauge the mood, and sensing that the assembly was not entirely happy with this rather direct criticism, he decided to forestall any protest. now i'm sure that you wish us well, tom, but um.. of any town, i believe this one has a very fine sense of community. living side by side we all know one another. i'm a pretty fair judge of character myself. honestly, tom, you've done it again. made us come here to listen to a lot of nonsense. what do you think you are, some kind of philosopher? observant, that's what i am. lazy, i would say. we shovel snow together. we shovel snow together? yeah. every household clears their own front walk. yeah, i gotta allow that tom's right on that. if roads don't get cleared properly... i'm sorry tom, you're going to have to come up with something better than that. but the whole country would be better served with a greater attitude of openness and accenpance. you're suggesting that we all wouldn't help out if someone needed help. no, that's not the point. that's not the point. we care for human beings up here. we would probably never find out. since nobody seems to want to admit that there's a problem, let me illustrate. now i'm not going to use something that's already happened. i'm going to use something that's just about to happen. and, after providing a quick summary of the events of the previous evening to the astonished people of dogville, tom went down to the mine to retrieve the fugitive from her hideaway. allow me to introduce grace. grace, these are the citizens of dogville. - hello. - hello. tom has told us about your predicament, miss. i really don't want to put any of you in jeopardy. why don't you just go to the police? they can take care of gangsters! it's their job. i, i don't know if that's such a good idea. the transportation business would uh... ben! these men, they have powerful connections, even with the police. do you think we should give sanctuary to a fugitive? a fugitive that gangsters wanna get a hold of. that would put us in pretty pickle. easy, claire... think of your asthma. dogville is a good place to hide, that's for certain. exactly. the only way up here is canyon road. that could easily be watched by ma ginger's -excuse me-nosey cousin who lives only yards from the turn off. she has a telephone. martha, you could ring the bell, tell the town if people were coming. but tom, i chime the hours, what if people get confused with all the ringing? come now, martha. surely we can use our old bell to save a life, if need be. why should we? because we care, chuck. we care for other human beings. no, that ain't what i mean. how do we know that this woman is telling us the truth? maybe these gangsters did shoot at her, but that don't make her somebody to be trusted. he is right. why would you trust me? i trust you! tom, we're not gangsters. we mind our own business we don't ask nothin' from nobody. so at last you admit it! if only there were some way, we wouldn't doubt the young lady's word. some way to know her.. then i think we would all ignore the risk. but there is a way! you said it yourself. by living side by side with her. dad, you are such a fine judge of character. how long would it take a good man like you to unmask her? a week? maybe two? surely we can offer her two weeks. and if after that time so much as one man cries out 'be gone!' i promise i'll happily send her packing herself. well, if master tom thinks this is right for us, and for the community, then that will do for me. he might be young, but his heart is right. and i've known his heart for as long las it's been beating. no more words were spoken at the town meeting in the mission house. but it had been decided, they all felt, that the fugitive would be given two weeks. and they would all be able to look at themselves in the mirror and know that they had done what they could, indeed, and perhaps more than most people would have done. so that very afternoon tom took grace on a stroll down elm street to introduce her to the town ""he loved"". well, this is where olivia and june live. june is a cripple... they live here as a token of my dad's broadmindedness. chuck and vera have seven children and they hate each other. next door we have the hensons. they make a living from grinding edges off cheap glasses to try to make them look expensive. and here we have jack mckay. now, jack mckay is blind and the whole town knows it. but he thinks he can hide it by never leaving his house. in the old stable ben keeps his truck. he drinks and he visits the whorehouse once a month and he is ashamed of it. martha she runs the mission house until the new preacher comes which will just never happen. that leaves ma ginger and gloria. they run this really expensive store, where they exploit the fact that nobody leaves town. used to leave to go vote, but since they put on the registration fee, about a day's wage for these people, they don't feel the democratic need any more. those awful figurines say more about the people in this town, than many words. if this is the town that you love, then you really have a strange way of showing it. all i see, is a beautiful little town in the midst of magnificent mountains. a place where people have hopes and dreams even under the hardest conditions. and seven figurines that are not awful at all. calling dogville beautiful was original at least. grace was just casting one more look at the figurines she herself would have dismissed as tasteless a few days earlier, when she suddenly sensed what would best have been described as a tiny change of light over dogville. they are keeping an eye on you. if you love them already, they might need a little persuading. you've got two weeks to get them to accept you. you make it sound like we are playing a game. it is. we are. isn't saving your life worth a little game? what do you want me to do? do you mind physical labour? no! dogville has offered you two weeks. now you offer them... the next day was a beautiful day in dogville. the tender leaves on ma ginger's goosberry bushes were unfurling despite wise tom's misgivings as regards her gardening methods. but more than that, this first day of spring had also benn picked to be grace's first ever day of work. the day in which she was to set off around dogville and ofeer herself one hour per household per day. excuse me. i would like to offer you my help.. if there is anything that you need? yeah.. a carburetor that don't leak.. alright here, let me take that. maybe i could help around your home? i don't really have a home. just the garage. i'm in the freight business. the road is my home! i'm ready. good morning! miss olivia has got a home. she is looking to help out in somebody's home. a cleanin' lady for a cleanin' lady? you be talkin' nonsense, mister ben! have a good day! alright. see ya later on! and off ben went to georgetown with the weekly shipment of glasses that mr. henson had so laboriously cleansed with his polisher of any trace of their cheap manufacture. so grace turned into the alley which went by the exotic name, glunen street to knock on the door of the blind, but only too vain, man. yes? good morning, mr. mckay. my name is grace. i was wondering if there is anything i can do for you? oh, that's very kind of you, grace, but... i was thinking that perhaps because of the situation that you are in... what situation am i in? hmm... you are.. on your own. oh, i have been on my own for so long. anything that you might need? i'm sorry! have you ever noticed the wooden spire on the roof of the mission house? at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, it points a shadow at ginger's grocery store, right at the o in open on the sign in the window. maybe it is telling people that it is time to go shopping for supper. goodbye, mr. mckay. bye, grace! grace's interview with jack mckay proved sadly symptomatic of the attitude in dogville. reserved but friendly, not without curiosity. only jack had expressed his ""no"" consicely and precisely: martha needed a monologue almost an hour long to arrive at the same conclusion. oh my goodness... i, i, i'd have to think of work for you to do, because i have barely enough work myself. so not very much later grace had ended up next to ma ginger's gooseberry bushes in a mood that was not particularly good. she could not tell a gooseberry bush from a cactus, but the meticulous order in the yard appealed to her, such as the metal chains placed there in order to shield the second and third bushes, lest anybody decided to make use of the deplorably time-honored shortcut to the old lady's bency. grace pulled herself together and headed towards the store. hello! hello. we don't need any help here either. i told that to tom. wow, it doesn't matter anyway, because there is nothing i can do. i have never worked a day in my life, so. you know, if you put some aloe on those hands of yours they'll be better by morning. it's the wood shavings. i really do hate them. but i do believe i'll take your advice. your hands are surely the most alabaster hands i've ever seen. here comes tom, how lucky we are. hi, all. grace.. how is all going? - not very well, i'm afraid. - really? no. nobody needs any help. well, i thought that might be the case. his plan to make everybody like me has run into a few problems because nobody wants me to work for them. i would really like to offer something in return. you're all running a terrible risk having me here. i mean, i am willing to learn. there must be someone who needs help. mr. mckay's sight is not good. yes, i went to mr. mckay. i went to martha and to chuck and vera's, and nobody seems to need any help. they all think everyone else needs something, and not themselves. funny, that's exactly what tom said. i supposed he's pleased. just to prove him wrong, maybe you can lend a hand here. but ginger, there really isn't anything we need done. perhaps there's something you don't need done? anything we don't need done? something.. something that you would like done, but that you don't think is necessay. what on earth would that be? maybe... maybe the gooseberry bushes. the gooseberries are just fine, thank you very much. no. not yours. the ones that planted themselves in the tall grass. we don't grow anything there. exactly. a bit of tiding up. who knows, those bushes might one day bear fruit. yeah. that's true! who knows.. all right, girl. those alabaster hands of yours are hereby engaged to weed the wild gooseberry bushes. thank you! around.. like this, you see. anything to close them... just be careful, that's all. after a few of the wild little gooseberry bushes had given up the ghost in the care of grace's as yet unpracticed alabaster hands, things began looking up with the weeding and the town. in fact it turned out there were not so few things that the other townsfold of dogville didn't need doing either. as ben had no home, grace's domestic experiments were absolutely things he didn't need, but he put up with them anyhow, appearing with astonishing punctuality when the act of domesticity had been completed, no matter how unpredictable business hours in the freight industry might otherwise have been. olivia didn't need anyone to help june to the toilet while she was at work, as hitherto they had coped splendidly with olivia's excellent diaper arrangement. if jack mckay had needed a partner for conversation he would surely have gone out and gotten one for himself in the town. so it was not out of need that he allowed grace to sit with him in his dark parlor with the dramatic drapes on one wall for lengthy discussions regarding the underestimated qualities of the light on the east coast. as martha wouldn't dream of burdening the parish with wear and tear of the pedals and bellows, while waiting for the new priest to be appointed, she practiced without a note ever leaving the organ, and was therefore not really in need of anyone to turn her pages. and god knows that mr. and mrs. henson's son did not need any help with his books, and that the family had taken grace for her own sake. and although liz's hands had improved through grace's good counsel, thomas edison was a doctor and of indisputable health and he did not need care, or help with the pills from the medicine closet with its many secrets. actually chuck was the only one ""not yet hooked"", as tom put it. hooked? you sound so arrogant! arrogance is the worst thing! he doesn't like me. and he has every right to feel that way. yeah. listen! luckily i have prepared a trojan horse. a what? trojan horse. we can get in by way of vera. there is this.. lecture tomorrow in georgetown, given by some professor. some intellectual thing. but not so intellectual he can't tour the provinces with it, anyway, the point is, vera she would do anything to go, but she's got no one to mind achilles while she is gone. she trusts the girls mastering their iambs and pentameters, but not with the little one. so this is where you come in. i said that you could watch him tomorrow afternoon. now, i will try and stall her on her way home and with a bit of luck, chuck'll get back before she does and you can use the time and all your charm to try and win him over. i'll happily mind achilles if vera will let me. but if he doesn't like me he doesn't like me. tom really was enchanted by this unusual, mysterious creature. and even though she did not satisfy his curiosity by saying anything about her past so as not to put anyone in danger, she still fitted tom's mission to educate dogville on the subject of acceptance like a glove. tom felt content. grace had been dangling over the edge, and he had been the one to pull her back onto the path. it gave him a fine sensation of mastery, new for him in terms of the opposite sex, and his feelings unleashed the best in his burgeoning love. hello. this is dahlia, olympia, diana, athena, pandora, jason, achilles. your children are lovely. they are good kids. and i love them. please don't say any such nice things about the kids. i cry too easily. both in sorrow and in joy. - hey, vera. - oh, hi! - shall we go? - i'm ready. thanks for leaving the map out. i'd a plum forgot it, i'm sure. how did you know i was going that far? the last time i saw the thermos, it was on the doorstep and the map was beside it, so i just thought, when i saw the thermos this time and no map, but... you are a sweet girl, grace. sweet as miss laura. who's miss laura? you gave yourself again, ben. i think miss laura is what ovid might call a maenad. oh, don't be ashamed, ben. we all have the right to make the most of our lives. i'm sure that those ladies in those houses they bring a lot of joy to a lot of men. ain't nothing i'm proud of. it really ain't. i know what you are doing here. you do? you want people to like you, so you don't have to go away. you are very smart. yes, i like it here in dogville. do you want me to read to you? about the cyclops? i don't like the cyclops. two eyes are pretties, like yours. if you want my ma to like you, and let you stay. you'll just have to be nice to me. maybe you should help me clean up instead. ma says i don't have to work, 'cept in my head. oh, but what about if i ask you, please? ok. what are you doing here? didn't i tell you we don't need no help from you? ma asked her to mind me and achilles. quiet! get out! the lot of you. the same nonsense! they'd have done just great in antiquity, no doubt. how is it going otherwise, with the fooling act? i wasn't trying to fool anyone? i mean dogville. has it got you fooled yet? i thought you were implying that i was trying to exploit the town. wishful thinking. this town is rotten from the inside out, and i wouldn't miss it, if it fell into the gorge tomorrow. i see no charm here, but you seem to. admit it you've fallen for dogville. the trees, the mountains, the simple folk. and if all that ain't got you fooled yet, i bet the cinnamon has. that damned cinnamon in those gooseberry pies. dogville has everything that you ever dreamed of in the big city. you are worse than tom. how do you know what i dreamed of? you're from the city yourself, aren't you? that was a long time ago. i am not that stupid anymore, i found out that people are the same all over. greedy as animals. in a small town they're just a bit less successful. feed 'em enough they'll eat till their bellies burst. that's why you wanted to get rid of me... because you can't stand that i remind you of what it was you came here to find. i'm telling you for the last time to get out of my home. moses don't like you. and i don't like you. the kids are going crazy enough from their ma's teachin'. thank you, grace! the two seeks had passed far too quickly. grace had enjoyed herself. all she could say was that she was fond of them all, including the folk who had greeted her with reluctance and hostility. even though she might not have won everybody over completely or even half way, as tom put it, she cared for dogville and she had shown the town her face, her true face. but was that enough? during jack mckay's long lecture that evening she had found herself in a heart-searching mood. whether heart-searching or concern for her future was the cause, the result was that the otherwise so lovable grace indulged in a pretty shady piece of provocation. so you agree that the windows of st. bridget's, at the first time you saw them, didn't live up to their reputation. i don't think it is the position of the church itself. maybe it's the light in los angeles and the mosaic glass in those windows they kind of collide, i remember thinking that. i think we've talked long enough about the way we remembering seeing things. don't you? why don't we talk about something that we can see right now? there is not much to see around here. wretched town. why don't we talk about the view? i don't go out much. the sun and my skin. yesterday i was walking in chuck's apple trees. if you go right up to the edge of the cliff you just manage to peer round ben's garage and you get a view of your house from the side facing the gorge. i didn't realize that there was windows behind there. huge windows. there must be a wonderful view. would you mind if i opened them? you're no fool, miss grace. you're no fool. you probably see that those curtains are hard to open. sorry! and obviously concluded that it's because they're not used very often. but the view's good, entrancing even. so, ask me, why a man who loves the light hang these heavy curtains? yes, i'm blind. not weak sighted, not myopic: blind. so please go and let me be that on my own. is switzerland they call it the alpengulen. that's the light that reflects from the highest peaks after the sun goes down behind the mountains. but now it's gone. it was in complete silence that the people of dogville turned up for the meeting at the mission house two weeks to the day since the beautiful fugitive had come to town. grace was standing beside tom, watching them convene, and knew inside herself that this might well be the last time she would see these now so familiar faces. she had at least two of them against her, and even one would have been too many. welcome good people of dogville. two weeks.... two weeks have passed and it is time for your verdict. is it right that she should be here while we talk? well, mrs. henson, when grace first came she made no attempt to hide her weakness from us. so i think it is only right we be as open with her, tell her to her face if we want her to leave. no, mrs. henson is right. nobody should be prevented from speaking their mind out of politeness. i'll wait at the mine. and if the vote says that i should leave, then i'll take the path across the mountains, while it's still light. and the things i've borrowed, if you could, return them to everybody. of course! nobody has to see me before i go. martha, if you will just ring the bell then i'll understand. i don't ... how do... am i gonna ring the bell? just ring it for every vote that lets me stay. i will count. and if it doesn't reach fifteen, then i'll leave. tom is anxious to speak in her behalf, but i think he's had his allotted time. we know his view. we respect it. and now he must respect ours. grace pulled her bundle out from under the bureau to change into her own clothes, only to discover that somebody had been in it and left a loaf of bread. next to it was a folded sheet of paper. it was a map tom had drawn. he had known where the bundle was and had put it there. it showed the path across the mountain. and all the dangerous spots were furnished with witty horrific little sketches. but there was more. several people had the same idea. they had eased gifts into the bundle for her. jason's beloved little penknife lay there, all polished and shiny. and a pie from ma ginger and gloria. and some clothing and matches, and a hymnal. grace opened it at number 18, where martha always had trouble with fingering. and between the pages lay a dollar bill martha alone could not have afforded it. grace had friends in dogville. that was for sure. whether they were few or many did not matter a jot. grace had bared her throat to the town and it had responded with a great gift: with friends. no gangster could deprive her of this meeting with the township, no matter how many guns in the world. and should the strokes of the bell did not reach 15, she knew now that she meant something to the town and that her stay had been of significance. not much, perhaps, but nevertheless, a trace she had left. and the first in her young life in which she took pride. grace stiffened as the bell began its toll. fourteen. grace counted. so mckay must have voted for her after all, and if so, why not chuck, too? everyone? - chuck! - chuck! everyone. i think they like you here. the period of spring and early summer proved a happy one for grace. martha rang the hours, conducting her through the day. so she could serve as eyes for mckay, a mother for ben, friend for vera, and brains for bill... and one day it had occurred to grace to tread the pedals herself so to get martha to agree to play a couple of paper notes, just to empty the bellows naturally so that they wouldn't be left under pressure and thus be spoiled. and now they had tacitly agreed that as long as it was grace who trode the pedals, martha could play without feeling any guilt. to tom's pop, the old doctor, who imagined he had a new ailment every single day and was thus increasingly addicted to the simpler coordination tests from his medical school days, she had to be severe, telling him that there was nothing wrong with him. and now, since the town had agreed that everyone was to give according to his abilities she received wages, not much, but enough to save up for the first of the tiny china figurines from the row of seven that had stood for so long gathering dust in the window of the store. and she dreamed that in time she would be able to acquire them all. slowly those alabaster hands turned into a pair of hands that could have belonged to anyone in any little rural community. and three weeks later she triumphantly moved into a place tom and ben had secretly restored, namely the old mill, which had once held the town's ore crusher, but of which only the heavy flywheel now remained. thanks. that's what i am talking about with the freight industry. miss laura had thrown that out, it was no use to anybody. a good thing, in the wrong place. but with my truck... you know. you shouldn't poke fun at the freight industry, that's all. no, you're right, ben. they shouldn't. grace! what? i just had to tell you that i had a really selfish reason for voting to keep you in dogville. what was it? it was such a relief when you turned up and you were the one all the men had eyes for. you know, tom and them. i've had to put up with it for so long.. frankly, i just didn't have the energy for it anymore. they'll always have eyes for you, liz. you know that.. they will. you are beautiful. thank you. the very latest development, now that summer was at its peak, was that grace had been given leave to help chuck in the orchard. and every day at 5, once their work was done, she could appreciate that actually mckay was right; the shadow of the spire did indeed point at ma ginger's store. but today the tower did not only announce that it was time to go shopping but also, by a signal which nobody despite martha's initial concern could have confused with the ringing of the hours, a warning that somebody was approaching via canyon road from georgetown. for the first time in living memory law enforcers had come to dogville! evenin' sir. is this the whole place? - there's a town hall? - no. i got me a notice to paste up. we got the mission house. that do you? sure. what'd she do? missing! that's all it says. i guess somebody's been missing her. heard tell she was last seen around here. we've putting these things all over the county. and if somebody sees her, they ought to go to the police? i guess that's the idea. these men were never gonna give in easily. now these posters they hang all over in the county. which means nobody suspects she's right here with us. but it was a policeman, tom. isn't it a duty to respond to the police? i mean, legally speaking. i'm sorry, i just.. when i get upset. she's just a missing person. she hasn't done anything. he even said so. i think you should vote again. why? we can't resort to plebiscites time and time again. come on. who's really got cold feet because of her picture on a piece of paper? the 4th of july came with the huge clouds of seeds from some remote meadow gracefully floating down elm street in the early evening. today was a day for celebration. nobody was to worry about the hard times. and grace could stop at ma ginger's window quite content: to ascertain that only two of the little china figurines remained, and were thus the only two she had not yet been able to save up enough to purchase. - it looks great, girls.. - uh-huh.. grace, could you put in a couple of hours with me in the orchard again today? it's really nice down there with the sunshine! chuck, it's the fourth of july! what are you talking about sunshine for? have you turned into a romantic like me? we're gonna have fun. and in the winter we'll all starve... even ben's taking the day off. - hi! - hi, tom! grace, you've got a moment? now? yeah. i've got something interesting to tell you. well, it has to be quick. i've got so much going on in my head... that must be very tiring for you! i think i've done a pretty good analysis of the folks in this town and i think i understand them in a meaningful way. but when i come to decipher you, i get absolutely nowhere. you know liz... liz is easy to read. and there was some attraction between us, but as i can see right through her, intellectually i mean, i can see right through her, my desire is purely of a physical nature. but with you, it's more... it's more complicated. what are you trying to say? no, i should get it clear in my head first. are you trying to say that ... you're in love with me? no, i wouldn't.. love is... it's not... it's a big word... yeah. yeah. that's good! because ... i think that i am in love with you, too. very interesting, isn't it? i mean it's interesting in a psychological... did they call you? i think they are calling you. i didn't hear them. no. you should probably get back anyway. i will see you at the wedding. next celebration.. this year i didn't bring any notes with me. because i'm not gonna pretend i can read them. which brings me to a point. a point i wanna make. and that point is you, grace. yes. you have made dogville a wonderful place to live in. as a matter of fact, somebody tells me they ran into grumpy old chuck down the street and he was actually smiling. well, i've never seen your smile, grace, but i will bet you i could describe it. because it obviously has every color that's reflected from the shiniest prism in the world. you probably have a face to match that. does she have a face to match that, tom? - yes, sir. - hmm..? - yes, sir. i bet she does. we are proud to have you among us. and we thank you for showing us who you are. here to you, grace. stay with us as long as you damn please. a police car has just been seen in town and it has just made the turn up canyon road! so he will be here any minute. shall i ring the bell? no, martha. grace probably heard. we'll get rid of 'em quickly. don't worry. should have been celebrating myself, if this hadn't come up. have to change this missing person notice. it's that lady again. that's why she disappeared. she's wanted in connection with some bank robberies on the west coast. when did these robberies take place? last couple of weeks. you don't get much news up here, do you? my dad's radio only plays music. well, all know is that they say she's dangerous, and that anyone with any information about her had better call us pronto. that's the law. two weeks! can't be our girl, tom. no, she's been here all the time. right! she couldn't have done what they are accusing her of. no, that's true, tom, you are right. still it's an unpleasant business just the same. grace was the same and so was the town. that the gangsters had fixed to have charges made against grace in their effort to neuralize her came as no surprise. but everything had changed a little yet again. i'm telling you, you have exactly the same kind of little lump in exactly the same spot on the other side of your back. really! i can only assume that it belongs on your body, but you're the doctor, so... well, it's very unlikely, don't you think? that a cancer would develop in such precise symmetry. - mr. edison, please. we've been over this so many times. - anything is possible. i think you have to accept the fact that you are an exceptionally healthy elderly gentleman. i'm gonna rest just the same. i'll see you in the morning. i hope so. what? what did they say? well, they couldn't really argue that anything had changed. but by not telling the police they felt they were committing a crime themselves. - i think i should leave. - no.. enough is enough. i suggested the opposite. you did? from a business perspective, ... from a business perspective, your presence in dogville has become more costly. because it's more dangerous for them to have you here, not that they don't want you, since they feel there should be some counterbalance, some quid pro quo. that sound like words that the gangsters would use... there is also more of an incentive if you don't wanna stay. see, with all those wanted posters hanging around the place, i can hardly think of anywhere else you could hide. so what's the counterbalance that you suggested? they wanted you to work longer hours, but instead what i proposed is that you just pay a visit to folks twice a day now. that way it would seem that you're willing to contribute more, without actually lengthening your day too much. it's just a way of heading off any unpleasantness. well, it sounds a little peculiar and difficult to put into practice. that's what i thought. martha she said she would ring her bell every half hour, so you could keep track of your new schedule. then, they are all willing to let me stay? no. see, mrs. henson she also thought we should cut your pay. merely a symbolic gesture. you see... the word dangerous on that poster worried her. i'm willing to do whatever it takes. if i have to work harder, longer hours for less pay, then i'm willing to do that. of course, i am. i just wanna be sure that they wouldn't prefer that i left town. of course not. you think this is for the best? i know it is. i have to get some sleep. my days are gonna be much busier now. sorry. tom, i just need to know something... you know the card that the man in the car gave you... yeah. did you show it to anyone? come on, grace! i burned it first thing. i've been so silly. of course you did. it's alright. no, it's not alright. i hate it for you to see me like this. i can't bare that i'm doubting you. i'm sorry. good night. everybody was really against any changes to grace's working conditions at all when the subjuct occasionally came up in conversation. oh, ben had declared in sympathy that he wouldn't accept any more work than before, and grace was grateful for that, even if he was a bit drunk when he said so. busy minute became busy hours, and busy hours became busy days. and irrespective of whether they thought the idea of increasing grace's services had any fairness and justification to it or not, it didn't seem to make anyone any happier. more to the contrary. grace, oh.. you have to be more careful. liz wasn't very careful either, but she didn't break our glasses. i think you need to understand that mr. henson works very hard to grind off any traces of moulds. and it makes the glass weak. i thought you knew that. it won't happen again. of course, i'll pay for it. no, of course not. you don't have to pay us for it. we'll get over it. and off she went to keep her appointment with chuck to free the last tree trunks from the grass in order to keep the ever busy mice away. she was in a hurry and took the shortcut between the gooseberry bushes, only to be brought up by a shout. - grace! - yes! oh, i didn't see that you just raked the path. i'm sorry. it isn't that i've just raked it. the idea is that people can pass around the bushes completely. i prefer it that way, as you should know. i thought that these chains were put up to make a path between the bushes. they were put up there to protect the bushes. it is not supposed to be a pathway. but everyone goes this way. dear, that's right. they have been living here for years. you haven't been here that long. are you saying, that i am less entitled to use the shortcut because i haven't always lived here? no, of course not. ""no, i just thought it pleased you to be here, that's all."" ""go on. go on, it's alright."" i'll see you this afternoon.. ""and i'll rake those bushes like they've never been raked before, i promise."" i'm sorry about that branch. there were so many apples on it. ""i should have cut that brance, but i got greedy."" is it greedy to want to feed your family? so how come you don't like me? why do you ask me that? ""when i get close to you, you edge away."" ""- no, i don't. - you did so."" when we were thinning the seedlings in the bottom row. how am i supposed to show you what i do if i ain't allow to touch you? you tried to kiss me. vera never took any interest in the apples. she hates the orchard. ""the is the first time i've ever met anyone, who understand about the apples."" sorry... it made me so happy. it's alright. ""no, it ain't alright. i reckon the stuff about the apples is just words in your mouth."" if you can't really share my pleasure... i do. vera wants me to picking apples from trees that are barely in the ground. things take time. that's love! seeing what they need and respecting those needs. ""if anyone understands that, it's you. at least i thought so."" i do understand that. but you edge away when i get close. - why do you find me so repugnant? - i don't find you repugnant. don't be upset. i'm sorry if i doubted you. it won't happen again. i promise you. i wouldn't make that promise if i were you. ""when you fended me off, a thought came into my mind"" that made me ashamed. a thought that you would hate me for. ""i would never hate you, never."" what? ""chuck, i've treated you unfairly. it's alright to have angry thoughts."" i thought of turning you in! i thought of blackmailing you into respecting me. ""it means that much to you? it does, doesn't it?"" ""you've really been alone up here, haven't you?"" you haven't had anyone to comfort you and i should ask you for forgiveness. still friends? - sorry... were you asleep? - no. ""- do you want me to leave? - no, i was just resting."" ""awful lot to do here in dogville, considering nobody needs anything done."" jason wants to sit on my lap all the time. i think you're doing a wonderful job. you give us all so much. what mr. mckay said... right on the button.. right on the button. he tried to put his hands on my knee today. ""oh, he is blind, after all. probably an accident."" and ma ginger got angry at me for running across the gravel path. ""well good. she gets angry at me,"" which just means that you're one of us now. ""you can see through it all, can't you?"" ""i'll tell you, i'm gonna be asleep in two minutes."" what if i don't want you to go to sleep? i don't think you have a choice tonight. ""i do love you, grace."" ""i'm glad you love me. i love you, too. i really do."" ""no, i mean, i yearn for you when i am not with you."" i yearn for you even when we're alone like this. ""i yearn to be even closer to you... to touch you, the way that people..."" we have our whole lives ahead of us. the thing that i love about you is that you don't demand anything of me. that we can just be together. yeah. yearning will only make it better. ""thank you for your words, your wise wise words."" you're welcome. do you want your shoes off? ""jason, what are you doing here? that's wrong."" the words have to be divided differently. stop it. how's that for dividing the words? this is not a good day. everybody should leave. ""everybody except jason. jason, i wanna talk to you alone."" what is it? what's going on? i can be very bad. i bet my pa told you. i don't think that. i think there is another reason for this. ""i'd love to have you on my lap all the time, but i can't, not with the others here."" ""when somebody can't do all the things they'd like to do for others,"" sometimes the people they promised get mad. that's what mrs. henson says. ""yes, that's true."" i suppose i know why you won't let me sit in your lap anymore. - why? - because i've been mean lately. ""oh, come on. i'm sure you have your reasons for that."" ""i have been mean to the others, too, even baby achilles."" and he's so tiny he can't put up a fight. ""- it's not right - no, it's not."" ""i got it coming to me, i know."" i deserve a spanking. what? i should hit you? i'm not gonna do that. your mother doesn't believe in physical discipline. i'm not gonna hit you. i know. she'd be awful mad if she found out you whipped me. ""oh, i just said i won't do that."" ""it's good having ma on your side, right? it'd be pretty serious if she turned against you."" ""i am the way i am. if people in this town don't like me,"" then there is nothing i can do about that. i feel bad i need to be punished. ""the fact is, i wouldn't have any respect for you if you don't give me a spanking."" i don't care how much fun you think it would be. ""i'm not gonna spank you, jason."" ""in that case, when ma gets home maybe i'll just have to tell her you hit me."" but i just said that i wouldn't! i reckon ma'll take my word for it. ""if you give me that spanking, nobody's ever have to know."" stop it. get away from achilles. stop it. i gave his crib a shove. it's not my fault it didn't tip over. don't you touch him. move away from the crib. ""stop it, jason. stop it!"" all right. you want a spanking. i'll give you a spanking... come here. come here! - there! there we go. - that wasn't hard. it's gotta be hard or it isn't punishment. - all right. - harder! ""oh, this is... come on. all right, that's enough."" that is enough punishment now. maybe i should go stand in the corner and be ashamed? i don't care.. stand in the corner. do whatever you gotta do. ""hey, there is pa!"" he's early. i hope there is nothing wrong. "" just as dogville had done from its open, frail shelf on the mountainside, quite unprotected from any capricious storms,"" ""grace, too, had laid herself open."" and there she dangled from her frail stalk like the apple in the garden of eden. an apple so swollen that the juices almost ran. and once again the police had come to dogville. ""i said i'd tell you, to save martha the confusion about the ringing. but i forgot."" they're already down by canyon road. the fellow in the other car is from the federal bureau of investigation. - you forgot! - yah. ""it is the busy time for the apples, you know."" the fbi? ""they were most interested in hearing what i'd seen in the past six months,"" anything related to that wanted poster. they asked me if i'd seen any signs in the woods of anyone camping out there. god only knows what that woman's capable of. ""you know, she is not capable of anything."" ""well, that's what you say. but it sure didn't sound that way coming from the laws."" that's why i felt i had to tell 'em what i knew. what did you tell them? ""well, i thought i'd seen something in the woods recently."" an item of clothing to be exact. it turned out that it was just an old hat tom had lost. - but it could've been this. -  chuck.. give me.. ""expensive, by the feel of it, and your initials on it."" i imagine they'd draw the same conclusion from this as anybody would. i told the law it'd take me no time at all to find this piece of clothing. ""i reckon we got us ten minutes, maybe fifteen, 'fore they start knocking on doors."" i wouldn't try to run away. they are sure to see you. ""why would i wanna run away, chuck?"" ""i wouldn't try to holler, either."" why would i wanna do that? it wasn't me who wanted you here. you were far to beautiful and frail for this place. you tricked me into feeling that i meant something to you. ""it's your own damn fault. i need your respect, grace."" - you have my respect. - i want your respect. don't...! this is wrong.. ""if i can force the flowers to bloom early in spring, i can force you..."" please... ""stop it! please.. please... please, don't!"" please! please... ""please look at me, talk to me."" ""we're friends, you and my family.."" stop it! have you seen grace? she's at my place. - is she busy? - not anymore. go right in. yet again grace had made a miraculous escape from her pursuers with the aid of the people of dogville. ""everyone had covered up for her, including chuck, who had to admit"" that it was probably tom's hat he'd mistakenly considered so suspicious. ""that evening tom had sensed at once that something had taken place,"" but had to plead with grace for ages before she finally broke down and unburdened herself. - i have to confront him. i mean. - no! - i have no other choice. - no. - no one will accept what he did to you. no one. - i don't want you to. i came here with all these ideas and these stupid prejudices. ""he is not strong, tom."" ""he looks strong, but he's not."" i'm gonna start looking for a way to get you out of here. the end of the summer had come. and in elm street the second clutch of dogville's scatty squirrels scooted in and out of the legs of children and grown-ups alike searching in vain for elm street's non-existent elms. ""the heat had turned the soil among the gooseberry bushes to stone, but grace did not complain."" ""she threw herself into her work,"" happy that it was something you could actually grasp between your fingers. ""hey, liz! hey, vera!"" ""better watch out, grace. vera's got it in for you today."" what are you talking about? maybe you thought he wouldn't tell me? who? you hit jason. i did. how could you do such a thing? ""i know it sounds implausible, but he was asking for it."" ""it's true, vera. he's always asking for it."" i should have done that myself a long time ago. ""- liz! - it's your fault, the way you've spoiled him."" ""i know how much you love him, vera. so do i..."" it won't happen again. it really won't. ""no. i know it won't, because i'll never leave them with you again."" that'd be far too dangerous for any child of mine. i've been tired. ""well, maybe you should see about sleeping at night, like most folks do."" sleeping at night? martha saw a certain tom edison jr. sneak out of her shed early this morning. ""grace, you won't hear anything from me about whipping that idiot kid."" and i'm also grateful to you for turning tom's wandering eye away from my skirts. ""but on the other hand, i'd expected more from you than that."" ""but if that's the kind of thing you're after, then i'm sure, with your innocent look,"" you will do just fine in a place like dogville. ""- it's not what i'm after, liz. - oh, no?"" we all saw you take his hand to the picnic. maybe that wasn't flirting? yes... maybe i was flirting.. next day the weather changed. the fog came rolling down from the mountains. ""and althought there were no sunsets to be seen, mckay thought it best that she sat by him anyway."" ""she had sat by jack mckay so many times now,"" but jack had not got better at judging the distance between them. ""on the contrary, where fingers alone had previously brushed her young flesh,"" now it was a and that remained in place throughout the allotted span. ""the hour in the orchard were long now, for the harvest was under way."" ""and grace had long since given up arguing with chuck's perception that respect for cultivation,"" ""harvest, and fruit could be directly measured in provision of carnality."" ""though reluctant to leave grace alone, tom wantered around quite often now,"" lost in thought as he tried to crack the problem of possible escape. ""and as grace's wages no longer found their way to her purse he had stepped in,"" and together they had triumphantly picked up the last of the seven figurines from ma ginger's windows. what's the matter? - nothing. - are the police on canyon road again? no. this is just girl talk. ""it's funny you should mention canyon road, though... right, martha?"" - she was just there this morning. - yeah. ""- on the way home from church... - you see so much more on foot, you know."" ""when you're in a car you never notice the apple orchard, for example."" you can only see it from one spot on canyon road. ""- do you know that spot, martha? - yes i do."" and did you stop there to enjoy the view this morning? ""it's harvest time, you know, in the orchard after all."" the old masters always loved a good harvest theme. ""redolent, with fertility, not to mention sensibility or even eroticism."" ""but how silly of me to ask you that, martha, because you already said you did."" ""she saw you, grace.."" she saw you.. behind this pile of broken limbs.. with chuck... he said it wasn't the first time you'd made advances towards him. he never told me before because he wanted to spare my feelings. ""he's a withdrawn and primitive man,"" but at heart he's loyal and he is good. what do you want with my husband? i don't want anything with your husband or anybody. what about tom and the hand-holding at the picnic? that's different. i like tom. but you don't like chuck. ""liz and martha are behind me, when i tell you that i'm going to have to teach you a lesson."" i believe in education. vera! no. i believe smashing them is less a crime than making them. vera.. remember how i taught your children.. ""- what? - remember how happy you were, when i..."" - when you what? - when i taught your children about the doctrine of stoicism and they finally understood it. ""all right.. for that, i'm gonna be lenient."" ""i'm going to break two of your figurines first,"" ""and if you can demonstrate your knowledge of the doctrine of stoicism by holding back your tears,"" i'll stop. have you got that? "" in her lifetime grace had considerable practice at constraining her emotions,"" and would never have believed it would be hard to control them now. but as the porcelain pulverized on the floor it was as if it were human tissue disintegrating. the figurines were the offspring of the meeting between the township and her. ""they were the proof that in spite of everything, her suffering had created something of value."" grace could not longer cope. ""for the first time since her childhood, she wept."" ""grace went to see tom that very night, and informed him that she was ready to follow his advice and leave the township."" ""and since tom had just made up his mind that a third party would be needed to ensure the success of an escape,"" they agreed that ben possessed the greatest potential. ""but it was a case where money was required, tom concluded,"" ""and estimated, that considering the times and all, ten dollars would suffice for ben and his truck."" - but we don't have ten dollars. - no. we borrow it. - from whom? - from dad. he has more than that in the medicine closet. i talk to him in the morning and arrange a loan. but you have a word with ben... ""it's the end of the week, he's bound to be flat broke."" tell your father that i will pay him back. of course. thank you. you are always rescuing me. i can't believe that you go on being there for me. good night.. you should get some sleep. grace went to see ben next morning. ""when grace presented the payment as compensation between friends,"" ""ben did not object too heartily,"" considering the trouble he could receive from the rest of the towns-people when they realized what had happened. ""perhaps they'd all be relieved that she was out of their lives,"" but somehow grace wasn't too sure of that. ""ben agreed to drive her, even though he wasn't out to profit from other folks' misfortunes, as he put it."" - i don't wanna profit from other folks' misfortunes. - no.. the fact was that ben would have driven to the gates of hell and back for ten dollars and the criminal aspect bugged him less than grace would ever have guessed; he had freighted all kinds of things in his day. the plan was for grace to hide among the apples. ""knowing the exact time to harvest is the greatest art of all, chuck had said,"" and the time had come for the apples and for grace. ""grace, where've you been?"" if i'd displayed the same indifference to the timing of my chores i'd be in for a whippin' now get a move on! ""i'm sorry, olivia. i had to talk to ben about something."" june is near to bursting. ""she can't use the pot on her own, as you well know."" it ain't fittin' to toy with her just 'cause she's crippled and can't help herself. "" the evening before the escape tom tactically thought it best not to press his desires of the flesh too hard upon grace,"" and instead he adopted a more sensitive approach. but there is a right and a wrong time to plant seeds and you can't plant seeds in the winter. that's true. but i love you... - i know. - and you love me and we will meet again in love and in freedom. absolutely. ""i shouldn't be ashamed wanting you, should i? it's nothing to be ashamed of."" no... - no. - no.. no. it's lovely. it's lovely that we want each other. - but not this way. - no. it's not right. "" the next morning, when grace wanted to slip down to ben's as invisibly as possible,"" it seemed to grace that the entire township was up and about at the same time. ""- grace! - yes, vera.."" ""if you think that by hitting my child you can get out of working for me, think again."" ""why don't you just come by as planned,"" and we'll find something where you won't be able to harm anyone. - at twelve o'clock? - yes. why are you taking your copious belongings around with you? afraid you are gonna loose them? ""grace, ben's hauling apples today so we won't be loading glasses."" but that don't mean you're off work. dad wants you to repack the whole last load. maybe you can do it better and we'll have an extra crate. ""an old crate like that may not have much value in your eyes, but this is dogville."" we're not wealthy here. ""and if your hands get a bit red, well, i've got a tip about something you can rub on 'em."" ""- grace! - oh, martha.."" we have to wash the flagstones at the foot of the steps again. dirt has gone blown under the door. i can't get the door open. where have you been? harvest is the holiest time of the year. does it not sound like something you could have said? ""i'll be down in a minute, chuck. i'll bring the crates down."" good. "" as grace hastened to the garage,"" she grew more and more pleased with the decision to keep her departure under wrap. there was actually quite a bit of work dogville didn't need doing that its residents would have to carry out for themselves in future. ""yeah, er, grace, i don't like having to say this, but i'd like to ask if i could have the money up front."" ""see, it's always the way in the freight industry."" ""once you deliver a load you ain't got much to bargain with, if you catch my drift."" of course. here's the money. ""not that this is a professional job, of course."" ""- don't get out... - all right, ben."" 'till i give the say-so! "" canyon road snaked down the valley and away, and grace went too,"" and with every bend the township and its noises faded ever more mercifully behind her. - is something wrong? - yeah. there are a hell lot of.. a lot of police up ahead. i wasn't expecting that. it's more dangerous than i thought. we'll have to go back. no! we can't do that. it's just.... ""if this was a professional transport job, you know, paid proper like...it'd be a lot easier, but..."" but it's been paid for... ""yeah, but, in the freight industry carrying dangerous load it cost more."" ""a surcharge, they call it."" ""if this were a professional job, i could just charge you."" ""but bun, i don't have any more money."" ""oh, that's no good then."" ""you said once, you said once, that there aren't many pleasures in my life."" ""and you know, i go to miss laura once a week."" and you got me to see that it weren't nothing to be ashamed of. i was gonna go there tonight... and of course it costs me. ""i mean, not as much as..."" ""not as much as a surcharge for dangerous goods, but  still..."" ""it does cost me, you know."" ""no, ben, no... please don't.."" ""it's not personal, grace. it's not personal. i just..."" ""i have to take due payment, that's all."" i don't .. i don't have a choice. i can't buck the freight in this big craft. we're parked in the square in georgetown. right outside the church. you'd better keep your voice down. ""no, ben..."" ""this ain't somethin' i'm proud of, grace. don't go thinking that."" "" grace fell asleep on the long highway, thanks to her healthy ability to push any unpleasantness around her far away."" ""a generous god had blessed her with the rare talent of being able to look ahead,"" and only ahead. ""and later when the truck slowed down about to reach its destination and she slowly returned to consciousness,"" she had no way of knowing how long she had slept. all she knew was that she would be happy to see the light of day again. and then she heard the dog. all your fondness for apples seems less and less believable. you've bruised 'em. we had a meeting last night at the mission house. ""they said you might be going to try to run away,"" ""so when i discovered you'd hidden yourself away on my truck,"" i didn't have no choice but to bring you back to dogville. in the freight industry we can't take sides. "" it didn't help grace that the first theft ever registered in dogville had taken place the previous evening,"" when most people were assembled for the town meeting. old tom edison senior had a considerable sum of money stolen from his medicine closet ""and suspicion soon fell on grace,"" who had apparently been planning an escape that would surely require funding. grace chose to remain silent in the face of these new charges. ""and then bill, who had lately improved his engineering skills to an astonishing degree,"" ""had, by way of his first design, implemented a kind of escape prevention mechanism."" ""beautiful it might not have been, but effective he dared say it was."" ""grace, we don't like having to do this."" we don't have much of a choice if we are to protect our community. could you... do you mind moving? try moving. it works. we had to make this heavy enough so that it can only move where the ground's level. and the ground is level in town. may i go now? i have to figure out how i'm going to get into my house. ""or is that part of the punishment, having to sleep outdoors?"" ""no, no no grace."" don't think of this as punishment. not at all! ""bill, he made the chain long enough so that you can sleep in your bed."" ""grace, six o'clock."" ""yes, mrs. henson."" i couldn't run the risk of dad turning me down. ""but, they think it was me that took the money."" 'cause i told them so. you did what? ""first they suspected me, but then i convinced them that it was you,"" since you were the one using the medicine closet. why? because i'm here to do the thinking for you. ""if we are to have the slightest chance of getting you out of here,"" they can never know how close we really are. they can't know i'm trying to help you. ""if they knew it was me that took the money, i wouldn't be here talking to you now."" ""please don't disappear, tom."" i need you. i'll break this one... with some thinking. "" it was not grace's pride that kept her going during the days when fall came and the trees were losing their leaves,"" ""but more of the trance-like state that descends on animals whose lives are threatened,"" ""a state in which the body reacts mechanically, in a low, tough gear,"" without too much painful reflection. like a patient passively letting his disease hold sway. ""and now that vera had received proof that it was in fact chuck who'd forced his attentions on grace,"" she was meaner than ever. ""had grace had friends in dogville they, too, fell like the leaves."" the most towns-people of the male sex now visited grace at night to fulfill their sexual needs. it had occurred to the children to give the bell an extra ring ""every time such an act had been consummated, much to martha's confusion."" but since the chain had been attached things had become easier for everyone: ""the harassments in bed did not have to be kept so secret anymore,"" because they couldn't really be compared to a sexual act. ""they were embarrassing in the way it is when a hillbilly has his way with a cow,"" but no more than that. tom saw everything. ""it pained him, and the sexual visits were a particularly severe blow."" ""but he supported her as best he could, the way a spider supports,"" when it has been tangled in its own web by the wind. tom! everything i tried to do went wrong. i can't come up with the answe i was looking for. ""you'll come up with it, you'll see. you're very clever."" - we provoked them. - i wouldn't worry about it. we provoked them. now it is time for us to provoke ourselves. what do you mean? ""i mean, by showing them some trust."" ""it all started with a meeting, so it will be logical to end it with one, too."" you'll talk and they'll listen. they can't refuse to listen. - what will i say? - everything. you'll say everything. ""- everything? - yeah, the truth. the truth."" just the truth about each and every one of them. i don't think they are gonna want to hear that. ""i know, i know. it is like a child who doesn't want to take his medicine."" ""they'll be furious at first, but in the end they'll see it is for their own good."" just don't be hateful. don't be reproving. ""if anybody can do it, grace, you can."" they'll all realize that this weapon and this understanding and injustice has only one true victim and that's you. and from there it is only one small step to forgiveness. ""you've done some hard thinking, tom edison."" i'm sure it is an excellent plan. i'm sure. "" if forgiveness was close at hand in the mission house, they were all hiding it well."" it hadn't been easy for tom to get them there. appealing to consciences stowed farther and farther away by their owners every day ""as if they were as fragile as henson's glasses after polishing, had proved quite a task."" ""but if one was going, the others might as well come along, too,"" so nobody could talk behind anybody's back. tom had set the scene for grace's speech. ""now she'd have to sink or swim, and sincerity be brought to bear."" while grace addressed the silent congregation in the mission house on elm street the first of the early autumn snowstorms embraced the town. the snowflakes dusted down over the old buildings as if this were just any old town. ""and they played in the brances and twigs from which the apples had hung,"" but luckily the harvest was home and via the freight industry had found a market despite the ever disappointing prices. grace had presented her story with clarity. she had not embellished or understated. ""and just as she finished the snowflakes all at once stopped tumbling down,"" ""leaving dogville clad in the daintiest, whitest blanket of snow imaginable."" i don't think it went very well. it's fine. you did good. "" the snow had come early, perhaps too early."" a misplaced augury of conciliation. ""tom looked around, worried:"" vera's teeth were clenched. she was the first to speak. copious lies. just lies. ""yes, tom. it doesn't accord with the perceptions i got of this town and its residents."" ""i'm a doctor, damn it, i don't need anyone to tell me if i'm sick or not."" ""what do you have to say for yourself, tom?"" maybe it's time you picked sides! are you for us or against us? liz is right. we've been far too indulgent with tom. ""tom, i got to tell you. even i have trouble defending that girl."" ""with your help, which i prefer to think was accidental, tom,"" she has managed to spread bitterness and troubles throughout this whole town. ""she has to go. how do we get rid of her, tom?"" ""so how do we do it, tom?"" ""i agree, tom. you brought her in here. you got to figure out how to get her out."" without her lies and accusations spreading. i asked you here to listen. you only came to defend yourselves. i'm sorry it's quite a blow to me... ""to see all of my friends act this way, so uncivilized."" ""your plan didn't work out very well, did it?"" ""- you'll think of another one. - no,"" ""no more plans, i promise."" they asked me to choose between you and them. that's not difficult on a day like today. i love you. ""you may be stronger, it's true, but the ideals, the ideals we share."" you're exhausted. lie down. ""i've chosen, grace. i have chosen you."" now it is the time! the time we've been waiting for. we free ourselves of dogville. ""you're right. you're right, tom. it'd be so easy to make love right now."" they may kill us any minute.. it would be the perfect romantic ending. i know. i feel it too. i love you. ""it would be so beautiful, but from ..."" ""from the point of view of our love, so completely wrong."" we were to meet in freedom. ""you're cold now, grace."" i've just rejected everybody i've ever known in your favor. ""wouldn't it be worth compromising, just one of your ideals just a little to ease my pain?"" ""everybody in this town has had your body, but me."" we're the ones supposed to be in love. my darling tom. you can have me if you want me. just do what the others do. threaten me... ""tell me that you'll turn me in to the law, to the gangsters and i promise you,"" you can take whatever it is you want from me. i trust you... but maybe you don't trust yourself? ""perhaps you've been tempted, you've been tempted to join the others and force me."" perhaps that's why you're so upset. all i've ever tried to do is help you. i'm just asking if you're afraid that you could be so human. ""no, i'm not afraid of that. not in the least."" good. let tomorrow bring that it's gonna bring. ""it's not a crime to doubt yourself, tom.."" but it's wonderful that you don't. i can't find the rest. maybe i should go out for a couple of minutes. take a walk or something... i don't know. to get it all out of my system. trudge the streets.. listen to the wind as it passes through the woods up through the valley and all that. ""you go to sleep, though..."" you go to sleep and i will be back very soon. of course it was all a load of nonsense. ""if anybody was capable of keeping track of ideals and reality, he was."" ""after all, it was his job. moral issues were his home ground."" to think that he might doubt his own purity was really to think very little of him. tom was angry. ""and in the midst of it all, he discovered why."" ""it was not because of he'd been wrongly accused,"" but because the charges were true! his anger consisted of a most unpleasant feeling of being found out! it was all quite a blow to the young philosopher! ""and realistically enough, he thought that if the doubt was already present, it could grow."" perhaps so great that one day it would prove detrimental to his entire moral mission. tom stopped. he almost began to shake when the threat to his career as a writer dawned upon him. it didn't take him long to agree with himself that the risk was too great to run. the danger grace was to the town she was also to him! tom did not like it. and he was man enough to take action to prevent it. fortunately tom was as conscientious as regards his future profession as he was practical. ""he allowed sincerity and ideals plenty of room in his life,"" ""without getting """"sentimental"""" about it, as he would put it."" ""throwing away a document that might be of significance to tom and with him future generation of readers as the basis of a novel or indeed a trilogy,"" ""was not an act he was so stupid to commit,"" although he had to admit that in a moment of weakness he might have said he would. ""before returning to the meeting that night tom opened the little drawer he had open the night of grace's arrival,"" and found it still there: the card from the gangster in the car. "" the next day the sun was shining in the brisk autumn sky,"" and the snow was long since gone. for the first time for ages the pile driver could be heard in the marshlands as it hammered in the piles for what might or what might not be a penitentiary. ""grace opened her eyes after an almost unconscious sleep, and was confused."" ""judging by the light coming through the cracks in the walls, it had to be nearly midday."" ""the grey hour as jack mckay for some reason called noon in dogville,"" ""being a man of many ideas and proclivities, quite a few of which grace would prefer to remain ignorant of."" but why had nobody roused her? nobody had hammered furiously at her door. not a child had thrown mud into her bed or broken her remaining windowpanes. now she remembered. ""she recalled the meeting the previous day, and puzzled still more."" why had she not been confronted with the outcome of that meeting? or even killed? it was quite unlike dogville to restrain its indignation at any point. perhaps things had turned out well after all? ""- good morning, mrs. henson. - oh.. good morning?"" i would have come earlier. i overslept. ""oh, never mind. liz put her back into it htis morning."" we thought some time off would be good for you. that was quite a speech you made yesterday. it gave us all something to think about. ""- hello, liz! - hi, grace.."" i overslept. - good morning miss grace? - good morning.. - how are you this morning? - i overslept. ""oh, that's all right."" ""tom. tom, i think it's grace."" ""hello, grace. two seconds.. good news."" i went back to the meeting last night. i wasn't going to let them get off so easily. but i'll be damned if the mood hadn't changed. ""i wouldn't say we won exactly, not exactly, but i think something very good can come out of this,"" - something very good. - why didn't you come back and tell me? ""i did, but you were asleep."" ""and you know, you looked like you needed it.."" and that made me suggest that maybe you should have some time off. ""and you know, not one single person objected."" that sounds wonderful. ""i know it does, doesn't it?"" the people of this town they surprise me again and again. i might even have to revise my theories a little bit. you know how much i hate doing that kind of thing. ""you know, grace, last night when i came back and i saw you lying there asleep so sweetly,"" i was suddenly inspired. i wrote the first chapter of a story. a story about a small town. guess where i got the inspiration? but i haven't come up with a name for the town yet. - why not just call it dogville? - wouldn't work. ""no, it wouldn't work. it's got to be universal. lot of writers make that mistake, you see."" ""hey, do you want me to read it to you?"" ""if there is any love in it, it comes from you..."" ""would you be offended, if i said no?"" ""- no. - if i really do have the day to myself, i..."" no. no.. two people only hurt each other if they doubt the love they have for one another. you can read it some other time. you sit down some place and gaze out at the mountains. it's what the girl in my novel does. - i'll see you later. - i'll see you. good news! "" sensibly, grace chose to hope for the best rather than fear the worst,"" ""and planned to spend the day calmly washing her clothes and herself,"" ""which, for some reason or another, she was sure none of the characters from tom's fictitious township would dream of doing."" and then it was as if dogville just waited. ""even the wind dropped, leaving the town in an unfamiliar calm."" ""as if somebody had put a large cheese dish cover over it,"" and created the kind of quietness that descends while you are awaiting visitors. ""after two days off grace had been put back to work, but the quietness remained."" indeed it intensified until on the fifth day it swelled into a strange mood ""that, all of a sudden, brought all the citizens to the street to listen."" ""they asked each other if the phone was really still down,"" or if they'd heard about ben having had to turn his truck around on his way to georgetown that very morning on account of a large tree blocking the road. they were not worried. ""worried was not the right word, and then tom spotted the cars."" tom has binoculars. but you can see 'em with the naked eyes. there must be at least eight! i thought the road was blocked. they must have come through before the tree came down. june's bed! the sheets need changing. i'll be there in a minute. ""hello, june."" "" grace had just started on the bed, which june had soiled yet again,"" when an irritating feeling of wasting her time forced itself upon her. and it was without thinking she then said the words: nobody gonna sleep here. "" she didn't say them out loud,"" but even so she was startled by the uttrance that had urged itself upon her. where had these ominous words come from? darkness was falling as grace made her way home from work that evening. the people on the square overlooking the valley had finally given up hope of seeing anything else now the light had faded. they trudged up elm street in disappointment. ""- tom? - hi, grace."" ""there were some cars, but it's too dark, we can't see any more."" we haven't seen much of each other. ""yah, i know. i've been busy with my book, you know."" can i ask you something? ""yeah, anything."" ""you couldn't bring yourself to throw it away, could you?"" the number he gave you that night. you couldn't throw it away. i told yhou how dangerous that man was. that was stupid. "" stupid or not, tom was soon a passionate spokesman for locking grace in her shed that night."" if the vehicles were indeed a sign that the call tom had placed five days earlier on be half of the community to the number indicated on the card from his bureau drawer ""had at last led to action,"" ""and grace was now to be eliminated from their lives,"" it would surely look good if the town had also locked her up. grace was lying on the bed when jason was sent up with the key. ""grace heard it turn in the lock,"" but she was deeply absorbed by arguments and thoughts on matters she had otherwise avoided for the best part of a year now. from the moment when they'd finally heard the sound of vehicles starting one after the other ""from the direction of the edge of the woods,"" things had moved rapidly. tom had arranged a delegation to provide a proper reception. ""dogville might be off the beaten track, but it was hospitable, nevertheless."" welcome gentlemen. welcome. the town places itself at your disposal! i should have a large key to give to you. but i only have this small one. - where is she? - secured by this very key. where is she? okay. if you are wondering about that sound. the driving piles for the new penitentiary. ""tell me, has the crime rate really gone up in this country, as we are lead to believe?"" ""maybe people just regard things as criminal, because they envy their success?"" what's your opinion on the subject? maybe you have none. i'll get the door... sorry. voila! as the french might say. what the hell is this? who did that? ""billy, put your hand up, put your hand up."" ""we felt safer, when she had the chain on. you are probably more adapted at handling her kind."" none of us feel able to accept money for just helping people. i mean not unless it would make you feel better to diverst yourself. - shut the hell up! - absolutely. "" grace was no expert in exclusive automobiles, yet she recognized with no difficulty"" the sound of vehicle that was rounding the corner from canyon road at that very moment. ""alas, in grace's memory the legendary purr of the cadillac series 355c was inextricably linked"" ""with another, rather less sophisticated sound:"" that of gunfire directed against her person. don't..! you need to justify your actions before you shoot us. that's new. ""that could be interpreted as weakness, daddy... i'm disappointed in you!"" i'm not gonna shoot anybody. you shot at me before. ""yes, i'm sorry. i regret that."" you ran away. but shooting at you certainly didn't help matters. ""of course not. you're far, far too stubborn."" ""if you don't want to kill me, then why did you come?"" ""our last conversation, the one in which you told me what it was you didn't like about me"" ""never really concluded, as you ran away."" i should be allowed to tell you what i don't like about you. that i believe would be a rule of polite conversation. that's why you showed up? and you call me stubborn. you're sure you're not here to force me to go back and become like you? ""if i thought there was a chance of forcing you, but of course that will never happen."" you are more than welcome to return home and become my daughter again anytime and i would even begin to share my power and responsibility with you if you did. not that you care. so what is it? ""what is it, the thing... the thing that you don't like about me?"" it was a word you used that provoked me. you called me arrogant. ""to plunder, as it were, a god given right. i'd call that arrogant, daddy."" but that is exactly what i don't like about you. it is you that is arrogant. that's what you came here to say? ""i'm not the one passing judgement, daddy. you are."" ""you do not pass judgement, because you sympathize with them."" ""a deprived childhood and a homicide really isn't necessarily a homicide, right?"" the only thing you can blame is circumstances. ""rapists and murderers may be the victims, according to you."" ""but i, i call them dogs,"" and if they're lapping up their own vomit the only way to stop them is with the lash. but dogs only obey their own nature. so why shouldn't we forgive them? ""dogs can be taught many useful things,"" but not if we forgive them every time they obey their own nature. so i'm arrogant. i'm arrogant because i forgive them? my god.. can't you see how condescending you are when you say that? ""you have this preconceived notion that nobody, listne, that nobody can't possibly attain"" ""the same high ethical standards as you, so you exonorate them."" i can not think of anything more arrogant than that. ""you, my child... my dear child you forgive others with excuses"" that you would never in the world permit for yourself. why shouldn't i be merciful? why? ""no no no.. you should be merciful, when there is time to be merciful."" but you must maintain your own standard. you owe them that. you owe them that. ""the penalty you deserve for your transgressions, they deserve for their transgressions."" they are human beings. no no no.. does every human being need to be accountable for their action? of course they do. but you don't even give them that chance. all that is extremely arrogant. i love you. i love you. i love you to death. but you are the most arrogant person i've ever met. and you call me arrogant! i have no more to say. you are arrogant. i'm arrogant. you've said it. now you can leave. ""and without my daughter, i suppose?"" ""- i said, without my daughter? - hmm, yes!"" - well.. - yes. ""well, you decide. you decide... grace, they say you are having some trouble here."" no. no more trouble than back home. i'll give you a little time to think about this. - perhaps you will change your mind. - i won't. ""listen, my love.. power is not so bad..."" i am sure that you can find a way to make use of it in your own fashion... take a walk and think about it. the people who live here are doing their best under very hard circumstances. ""if you say so, grace."" but is their best really good enough? do they love you? grace had already thought for a long time. she had known that if she were not shot when the gangsters arrived ""she would be faced with her father's suggestion that she return, to become"" a conspirator with him and his gang of thugs and felons and she did not need any walk ""to reconsider her response to that,"" even though the difference betwen the people she knew back home and the people she'd met in dogville had proven somewhat slighter than she'd expected. grace looked at the gooseberry bushes so fragiles in the smooth darkness. ""it was good to know that if you did not treat them ill,"" ""they would be there, come sping as always, and come summer they'd again be bursting"" ""with the quite incomprehensible quantity of berries that were so good in pies,"" specially with cinnamon. grace looked around at the frightened faces behind the windowpanes ""that were following her every step, and felt ashamed of being part of inflicting that fear."" how could she ever hate them for what was at bottom merely their weakness? she would probably have done things like those that had befallen her ""if she'd lived in one of these houses,"" to measure them by her own yardstick as her father put it. ""would she not, in all honesty, have done the same as chuck and vera and ben and mrs. henson and tom"" and all these people in their houses? grace paused. ""and while she did, the clouds scattered and let the moonlight through"" and dogville underwent another of little changes of light. ""it was as if the light, previously so merciful and faint,"" finally refused to cover up for the town any longer. ""suddenly you could no longer imagine a berry that would appear one day on a gooseberry bush,"" but only see the thorn that was there right now. the light now penetrated every unevenness and flaw in the buildings... and in...the people! and all of a sudden she knew the answer to her question all too well: ""if she had acted like them, she could not have defenced a single one of her actions"" and could not have condemned them harshly enough. it was as if her sorrow and pain finally assumed their rightful place. ""no, what they had done was not good enough."" ""and if one had the power to put it to rights, it was one's duty to do so,"" ""for the sake of the other towns, for the sake of humanity,"" ""and not least, for the sake of the human being that was grace herself."" ""if i went back and became your daughter again,"" when would i be given the power you're talking about? - now? - at once! why not? so that would mean that i'd also take on the immediate responsibilities at once. i'd be a part in the problem solving... like the problem.. of dogville. we can start by shooting a dog and nailing it to a wall. ""over there beneath that lamp, for example. well, it might help. it sometimes does."" ""it would only make the town more frightened, but hardly make it a better place."" and it could happen again. ""somebody happening by, revealing their frailty."" ""that's what i wanna use the power for, if you don't mind."" i wanna make this world a little better. ""that damn kid won't shup up. says he wants to talk to you, miss."" can we just shoot him now? let me talk to him. what? what is it? ""a man can't really be blamed for being scared now, can he?"" - no. that's true. - no! ""i'm scared, grace."" i used you. and i'm sorry. ""i am stupid, i am. maybe even arrogant sometimes."" ""you are, tom."" ""although using people is not very charming, i think you have to agree"" that this specific illustration has surpassed all expectations. it says so much about being human. ""it's been painful, but i think you also have to agree it has been edifying. wouldn't you say?"" ""not now, tom. not now."" ""if there is any town in this world would be better without, this is it."" shoot them and burn down the town. ""what? something else, honey?"" there is a family with kids... do the kids first and make the mother watch. tell her you will stop if she can hold back her tears. i owe her that. i'm afraid she cries a little too easily. we'd better get you out of here. ""i'm afraid, you've learned far too much already."" ""are you cold, sweetie. do you need a wrap?"" i'm fine. you want the curtains opened? you don't need them anymore. what do you think? i think we should open them. i think it's appropriate. ""bingo, grace!"" bingo! ""i have to tell you, your illustration beat the hell out of mine."" ""it's frightening, yes, but so clear."" do you think that i can allow myself to use it as an inspiration in my writing? goodbye tom. - somethings you have to do yourself. - really that one you're gonna have to explain to me on the way home. suddenly there was a noise. ""not so persuasive and powerful as it had been on a rainy night in spring,"" but loud enough to work its way through the final sighs of the timber that was rapidly burning out. it came again. everyone heard it. grace was the first to recognize it. ""that's moses,"" ""that's moses, she said, and jumped out of the car."" ""she quickly covered the distance to the dog pen over what, now the buildings were gone, could scarcely be called a street,"" ""and certainly not elm street as there wasn't a tree left on dogville's little mountain ledge,"" let alone an elm. it was moses. his survival was astonishing. a miracle. ""no, just let him be."" they will have spotted the flames in georgetown by now. some one'll come and find him. he's just angry because i once took his bone. ""whether grace left dogville or on the contrary, dogville had left her (and the world in general)"" is a question of a more artful nature that few would benefit from by asking and even fewer by providing an answer. and nor indeed will it be answered here!"
Von Trier,Idiots,"the tension mounts, hits the roof and falls to earth with a bang... i'd like some prawns. prawns? i'm afraid... - are you alone? - yes. - i'd like a salad then. - with parma ham? parmesan cheese?

that lunch would have cost a fortune. - you do have the fare, don't you? - of course. they're just... don't mind them. don't worry. karen was the last to join the group. she was really nice. it wasn't that. karen was really nice, but she was also... i think she'd have joined anything. i don't know how she came to the factory, but she did. i don't know... i don't know what she thought. she was right when she said, ""you're poking fun."" yes, we were poking fun. hi, stoffer. hi. now we get out of the car again, right? are you the person i talked to? welcome to the factory. oh, you've brought a wheelchair? don't leave her behind. it may sound a bit... a bit dull. but when you get to know it, it's actually a fascinating product. hey, no, no! you mustn't do that. watch this. i'm going to stop the entire production of rockwool in denmark. - and it stops. - no! - no! - don't worry. hey, you! come over here! don't be frightened. press the green button. do you see it? come on! it's fireproof, as you see. nothing's on fire. don't be frightened. nothing will happen. wait for the bang. shall we have a soda? yeah... don't press that... just let it hang there. now, you've heard about rockwool and how it works. now, i'll ask you... which of these houses is insulated with rockwool? yes? come on up... that was almost right. those who think this one is insulated with rockwool put your hands up. rather a lot... i think i can hear your minibus. i think they're leaving. don't get left behind. there. that's the best place, almost. - bye-bye. - bye. that's the lot. give us a hand, karen. who... is he driving? responsibility does them good. no, not... - is that really a good idea? - no harm done, he's doing fine. reverse, reverse! thanks for coming. we have a driver who is a nutter at our camp at our camp we have a driver who is a nutter at our camp where we are... what do you think? i don't think it was very funny. why not? you poke fun. - they're the ones who poke fun. - stoffer, cool it. anders speaking. is that you, karen? jeppe copped out right in the middle and it pisses me off. he didn't cop out. - but you think so? - he wasn't there. it was written all over his face. you should fucking well play along. leave him alone. did you think i was bad too? i wasn't watching anybody. i was trying to feel it for myself. surely that's allowed? i can't say whether you were good or bad. what are you writing? that i was good or bad or...? i write that you were... bad. you can sleep here if you want. there's enough room. i'm not going to sleep here. i'd just like to sit a while. i thought jeppe was good. - where the hell was jeppe good? - he was good by the machine. he did fuck all by the machine. fuck all. i know. that was what was so cool. a quick summary of what we were at? no, an understandable summary. i've heard 17 different versions. a quick summary? they wanted to fuck as many as possible... as quickly as possible. isn't that so, axel? axel says it was his idea. i think it was stoffer's. it was my idea, but it was stoffer... who wanted to do something about it. that's funny. none of the others say it was your idea. how come? none of them! would stoffer also say it was a game? no. i don't think so. - but it was? - yes, it was, really. - good morning. - good morning, honey. - good morning. - good morning. axel, you have a visitor. - actually, it's katrine. - oh, shit. - hi. - hi, katrine. is there something i've got wrong? you didn't go to jutland? sure. i've been to jutland. because i thought this spassing about was pathetic. - so what the hell are you back for? - i've changed my mind. - ""changed your mind""? - yes. is that wrong? you might have come to get me back again, right? what the hell would i see in you, man? - oh, katrine... - you think very highly of yourself. quit touching me. your lies are pouring out of every hole in your body. - what's your problem? - no problem. if that's the way you feel, come on. you want to go outside? fine. stoffer! axel is telling me to beat it. pretty weird when i've come to spass. - she's come back to get at me. - who has? three guesses. say something to her. katrine, have you come to spass or have you come to get axel back? i've come to spass. what are you doing, jeppe? i'm tying this up... first round the lake. no, out of the lake, round the palm tree, into the lake. i'm not coming if anyone's going to be rough or silly. it's slippery and dangerous and you can fall and get hurt. you mean it's slippery at the public pool? axel, are you going to be rough? - round the lake... - don't look at me. i know fuck all about knots. - heck! - there's a knot in it. why all this scout shit? who is minder today? you're minder yesterday. - round the palm, into the lake. - the palm? what's that? - what do you think? - listen up! it's crazy if i'm the only one who ever minds. it's unrealistic. - josephine can't even mind herself. - thanks a bunch! karen, what about you? would you? - yeah, karen! why are you undoing it again? stop... stop it! i'll tie it up. get into the car. round the damned palm and out of the bloody lake. no, into the lake. - right then. - it's not very tight. you're driving me fucking bonkers. - they're going. - round the lake... out of the lake, round the palm tree, into the lake again. i'd rather not help poke fun. hey lads, will you lend me a hand? - has it broken? - i can't figure it out. katrine, we've got to talk. i've a wife and a kid. it won't do. what do you want? maybe i bought it a size too small. in the boutique, it fitted like a dream. you want me? out of the question. - it's impossible. - give her the ball. that's right. you are the most vicious cunt i've ever come across. hey! stop trying it on. - i felt you feeling up my back. - i wasn't. you were too. if i do this to you, can't you feel it? ped? ped? they're... ped? don't make passes at me or i'll call my husband. go to the men's changing room at the other end. stoffer, let go. let go, all right? yes, it's stoffer's willy. turn round, stoffer. there. when i think about karen, i think of... how do you say it in danish? a puppy? a little animal. maybe she stayed out of defiance. i don't know. it turned out that karen really needed us badly. - why do they do it? - that's a bloody good question. they're searching for their inner idiot, karen. what's the idea of a society that gets richer and richer when it doesn't make anyone happier? in the stone age, right? all the idiots died. it doesn't have to be like that nowadays. being an idiot... is a luxury but it is also a step forward. idiots are the people of the future. if one can find the one idiot that happens to be one's own idiot... miguel, right? he is a happy idiot. because he is a happy man. but there are people who really are ill. it's sad for the people who are not able like us. how can... how can you justify acting the idiots? you can't. i would just like to... understand. - i mean... - understand what? why i'm here. why i am here. perhaps because there is a little idiot in there... that wants to come out and have some company. don't you think? got the sun lotion? did you bring it? - no... you think it'll tan today? - it always tans. thanks. after the steps, it's downhill all the way. how's the wind? that way! your style, jeppe! yeah! stop! i'm not having it. look how far down it is. - now, jeppe, now! - stop it, miguel! what did you feel for jeppe? very nice. would you like to phone him? - now? - yes. have you talked to him since? - no. - would you like to? i don't know, i don't talk to any of the others. from the group. why not? yes, they were a family. i... yes, they were, damn it. i was on the outside. but not emotionally. because i loved them all. and they know it. maybe we just weren't so strong together as we thought. stoffer, damn it. axel is smashing the shed windows. let him. sheds are bourgeois crap. smashing windows is obviously part of axel's inner idiot. there is also a man. - what? - a man. fine, miguel. - he says he is your uncle. - svend? - that's what he said, yes. - when did he arrive? - just now. - has he met anyone? - were they spassing? - no, everyone's asleep. thank god. it's his damned house. i thought it was yours? well, it is in a way. i'm borrowing it till it's sold. hi, svend. these floors, right... they were waxed every day. every day for fifty years. - every day, pal! - wow. bloody hell. - are they living here? - living? no... - but they're asleep. - i invited them. to help shine the place up a bit. they're qualified craftsmen. how interesting... that you know so many craftsmen. what snobbery, uncle! craftsman's kids attend the best schools now. - that's jeppe. - yes? he does the garden. - and the flagstones. - the flagstones too? - did you get the for sale sign? - yes, it was just what we needed. know what? you'd better take this seriously. or i'll find someone else to sell it. you know that, right? - what kind of craftsman is he? - a glazier. luckily, as a couple of the shed windows are broken... we're thinking of putting hardened glass in all the way round. - drive carefully. - not on your life. we're so happy here. i have no right to be so happy. oh, you have. of course, you have. you're allowed to be here and you're allowed to be happy. - do you believe me? - yes. hello, we're from a commune for the mentally handicapped up the road. hello... is your mummy in? hello, we've some christmas decorations for sale. - want one? - no, thanks. how much are they? ped, how much are they? $80. - and five cents. - they're not cheap. what shall we say, then? - $600. - and five cents. - they cost $2. - and five cents. let's hope it lasts. look, we made $2. - and five cents. - yes, and five cents. we've debased ourselves enough in this shitty district. you'd better come outside, there's been an accident in your drive. - is it serious? - i think you may say so. the retards were out selling and they fell over. you're in a spot. your running stones aren't flat. - ""running stones""?! - yes. they're far too high. - yes, but... - sulked... sulking... - a bloody mess. i hope you are insured. insured? is anybody hurt? ""ls anyone hurt""? well, i mean... are you sure it was the cobbles? are you saying they drag their feet? - that they're clumsy? - no, no... that they're too clumsy to cross your cobbles? - sulk... - shut up, jeppe. nobody will buy these now. they're completely fucked. you've spoiled things for the retards. - how much are they? - $4. - each. - and five cents... society doesn't pay to keep them... so they can bust their tails on your running stones. you've forgotten one. man... man... man. why christmas decorations? why the humiliation? no wonder people who are already head cases... get a distorted picture of reality. would you rather make kites? - what's this? - quite. what's this? i'm vibeke and i talked to your uncle about the house. it is this house that's for sale? there's no sign... and there's usually a sign? it must have fallen down. we must put it up again. unless i can sell to you. it's a cute house, isn't it? though it needs a bit of work. who'd move into anything today and not chuck in a couple of million? that's true. - this will be removed. - ok. it's not a fixture and fitting? - no. - we should be so lucky. stop it! there is one little minus. - oh? what can that be? - i have to mention it. there is an institution just down the road. - an institution? - an institution for the retarded. i thought soelleroed town hall had a policy in that respect? a policy? of not mixing residential areas and... ...institutions. i just thought... i don't know... my husband and l have been abroad a lot. one comes home and things have moved so fast, eh? of not mixing... residential areas, private areas with institutions... oh that kind of policy? no, it's a myth. i think. - how little we know! - it's not on nowadays. no, no, goodness, no. it's just a bit of old nonsense. the other people who've been to see the house seemed to object. - to what? - the institution down the road. - oh, yes. - a peculiar way of thinking. but one does meet such people, even today. - most peculiar. - it is rather an old house. where is it, precisely? is it far? - it's next door. - your next door neighbours. yes... and they've been coming here a bit... while the house has been empty. of course, that can stop. but the retards like picking nuts. they pick nuts in the autumn. but you have no objection to... the mentally handicapped? objections to the mentally handicapped? of course not. i think it's fascinating. it's fascinating to follow... ... to follow people like that. i follow them a lot... when i see there's a documentary on tv... it interests me a lot. their behaviour is far more innocent... my husband had... at one time... a cousin... who married into a family with mentally retarded. or he had a... your cousin was married to a retard? - no, no. he wasn't married to one. - would you like to meet them? - they've come for a cup of tea. - they're here now? they do pop in now and then. wouldn't that be nice? damn it, yes. - we'll meet a couple, then go. - susanne, line up the retards. - our new neighbors want to say hi. - it's a lovely site. - come and say hi to the lady. - say hi to your new neighbors. finn has got a cousin who's a retard. - so you know what it's like. - say hello nicely. actually, finn's cousin is... oh, never mind. we could start by saying mondays, wednesdays and fridays. - for what? - for using the garden. they so much need fresh air and we haven't many possibilities. can we go on coming? - coming here, i mean. - yes, no problem. - that's really kind of you. - we didn't even dare to hope... did you hear that? we can use their garden. use it like crazy. where zayn? where zayn? the seine? the seine's in paris. nice meeting you... i could fetch a bit of paper... it's a bit soon for paper. we've things to do first. but we'll be seeing you, right? we'll see you before i can count to ten. see you!definitely! bye-bye! bye-bye, vibeke. - well karen, we've sold the house. - have they bought the house? no, definitely not. he's just having you on. i thought they were all very nice. jeppe was... interesting to hear that they were nice. the idea doesn't seem... polite. no, but... no, you could put it that way. no, no, no, ped! - hi. - hi. smile, everyone. what's your name? shall we find some sodas and stuff? would you like that? that's a good idea. - well, old bean. - you're still young. will you pass me a soda? if there are any left? please leave me alone... - it's a bit crooked. - would you like to buy one? no. what are you doing? - i'm here on vacation. - on vacation? on vacation? what the fuck am i meant to say? - are you on vacation? - what the hell am i meant to say? what's with him? - all this sentimental crap... - what's wrong with that? it's lovely. they're cute. - cute? - yes. cute? you haven't got the slightest fucking idea. about what? they're visiting and they like it here. what's that? - a camera. - what for? i was wondering if one might take a photo. a photo? you want to take a photo of them? hey, let's measure their skulls and gas them. this is great. it's just a pity we can't capture their genes on film. henrik has a camera. may he take a photo of you? yes! hold his hand. he'd be so pleased. you're all looking great. except you, henrik. smile! henrik, smile. yes, they were highly credible. they were really good at it. one has to be able to look other people in the face afterwards. that one can... that one doesn't take the piss out of people the whole time. any retards out here? shut up, nana. cooee! miguel? i get all jumpy without you drooling over me all day. where's jeppe the retard? what's the matter with you? they really got to you, didn't they? wow, it's great to be here. karen? oh, karen, damn it! susanne? karen's gone into spass. karen's gone into spass. karen, come on, it's lovely. lovely water. come on. is it lovely? look, you're floating all by yourself. axel speaking. i'm at baby swimming, damn it. you can't fire me for paternity leave when i'm actually on it. you look like a dickhead in that, axel. dressed to kill. when are we going to talk? - i've got to pop into the agency. - what for? i've got to work on a pay-off. a slogan. i have to wear my best gear to see the best people... and win the best customers. - i don't see why you have to go. - to work. we're trying to steal a client from another agency. benedikte. scandinavia's biggest powdered food manufacturer. when are we going to talk? - when i'm through. - when will that be? when she slips of the hook or when we land her. - any time you like, babe. - i would like... but not now. i'm just so fucking busy. - when i get back. - promise? - we'll talk all you want. - promise? - yes, i promise. - but you have a wife and baby. that's history. can you imagine me pushing a pram? i'd go crazy. it's so fucking middle class. i don't want a wife and kid. i want you. whoops. here comes reality. i'll be back in a jiffy. bye, sugar. oh, katrine! you wade right into it, with both legs. what did he want with her? to screw, shag, fuck, make love. - all four? - all four. katrine claims you held some very anti-middle-class views. - or ideologies. - i do. what's up, darling? based on what? your ideologies? - ""anti-middle-class ideologies""? - yes. mainly that there is something more than meaningfulness. and purposefulness. oh? she made it sound like something to do with the family. katrine played a few tricks on axel, i've heard. yes, but damn it, they were... more in the land-him-in-the-shit genre. a corporation is a religion. ""child's food"". what the fuck do you mean by that? it's the pay-off. child's food. chlld's food it means it's easy. it's food... and it's so easy that even a child can make it. i'd fucking well figured that out. but the company does actually make children's foods. - i didn't know that. - you didn't know that? you should have checked before coming up with such crap. a pathetic slip of paper. shut up when i'm talking to you! chlld's food - is it me personally you don't like? - no. they're using hjart at the moment and they know it's hopeless. but you've stoked benedikte's fires nicely. on the phone she sounds ready. she's crazy for you. for some reason. i've made some flashy folders with charts and all. they're for another product, and she won't look at them anyway. but when you come up with crap like that... it's known as baby food, not child's food. so ""child's food"" can easily be the pay-off... for someone who makes baby food. quite sophisticated, really. - baby food, child's food. - baby food, child's food. bloody hell. she's here. i'll go and talk to her first. then you come in with svendsen. and severin, to be on the safe side. but whatever she says today, keep your balls in the air. ""child's food"", for fuck's sake. - svendsen. - benedikte. - severin. - and you know each other. - no. - we haven't had much time. but sometimes that's what it takes. a deadline... axel, will you show us what you've got? axel? problems? if you're worried about taking a client from another agency... no, it's not that. axel, show us what you've got. even if it's provisional. ah, an itty-bitty wee thing. child's food... if i read you right... you are favourably disposed towards... toward child's food. - i think it's... bloody good. - fine. we have a luxury problem. it could be too sophisticated. it might be confused with children's food. - children... baby... - it's sophisticated. - would you like a glass of water? - yes, please. have you got a colour printer? if you like these colours, we'll keep them. may i ask the kind of... we... figure... i mean how much money are we talking about for the campaign? 20 million? that would be with the buses and all. no, the buses would come on top. - axel? - excuse me. i think benedikte and l will take a stroll. - come along, benedikte. - need any help? enjoying yourself? i'm loving it. get out of here. phone and say you haven't the authority. but not that the pay-off sucks. but it does suck. that tiny bit of paper... how the hell did you get in? ""child's food..."" how do you think these things up? is that what you do here? i'm amazed. - it's incredible - get out, katrine. ok, ok, i'm out of here. card, please. - no way. - ok. we'll continue the meeting. see you. is this the way out? ok. we've talked about that now. but why are you lying to me? - i'm not. - you are! you say you didn't hump katrine, but i know you did. if you want to be so liberated and unprejudiced... you have to admit you humped the bitch. - that's not what it's about. - it is! you're lying. it just isn't. hey, don't stare at strangers. excuse my brother, he's soft in the head. it's the tattoos, man. he likes them. is it, jeppe? is it the tattoos? look... iook... would you like to sit down, jeppe? would you like that? sit down. you're allowed. good for you, meeting such nice people, eh, jeppe? you'll really have a tale to tell the other patients. i have to use the cashpoint. would you mind keeping an eye on my brother till i get back? - sure, that'd be ok. - i'll only be ten minutes. watch that arm, guv. - is he allowed to drink? - yeah. - easy does it. - cheers, jeppe. he may get beaten up, you realize? no, they don't hit retards. they will if they discover he's taking the piss. he'll just have to play the part, then. it'll do him good. he may learn something. hey, jeppe... are you clocking linda? eh? have you taken a shine to linda? no... no... where the hell is he going? ... hey, you! maybe he's just stretching his legs. you've got to stay here. - where was he going? - no idea. were you trying to escape from us? - he needs a piss, that's what it is. - he needs a piss. look... right, then. out with the bastard so we can get it over with. not much going on there. of course. they can't piss by themselves. maybe he needs a hand. there. - right. - drain the spuds then. turn the tap on, it usually works. come on. come on. come on. a man' got to go when a man's got to go. not much action going on. come on. come on! - and old trick. - that's better. why are you washing his hands? he never touched his dick. i was beginning to think you'd taken him for a chopper ride. maybe he'd like to ride linda? say good-bye and thank you to the kind people. see you around. jeppe! come here! jeppe! jeppe, damn it! come back! stoffer... i thought you were horrid to jeppe. he's just being a dweeb. he's always been like that. boring cunt! sorry... though i don't know why. what you did was really mean. i don't get it. it's so lovely here. why is there so much getting at people? - what good does it do? - hear that, stoffer? karen says all this is just for getting at people. hey, aren't you having a hard time! why do you stay here, then? - yes, i am a real fucking bastard. - not compared to me. you're not a bastard, you're just egocentric. i'm a bastard to everyone i know. to katrine, to my wife... oh, no! you passed hard enough to spass iranian caviar off the shelf? - i've seen it, thanks. - 1 80$? that's insane. crazy! why are you poking at it? we're in soelleroed, damn it. at least eat it the way they eat caviar in soelleroed. if you can spass with yogurt you can spass with caviar. that's expensive stuff. there are people starving... there aren't any people starving. ... that's the whole trick. - i'd like to borrow the phone. - stoffer, here's 70 bucks' worth. stoffer, there's a man from soelleroed town hall to see you. from town hall? hello there. i have a solution to your problem. you have a solution to our problem? what problem? i don't know if i've chosen the right words. but to boil it down to its essence - - we have an agreement with a distinct across town, hvidavre... it might be advantageous to you. hvidavre? i can't tell you officially that i can promise you a grant if you decide to transfer your private home for the handicapped. but the chances are good. if we transfer our home for the handicapped from soelleroed to hvidavre, we'll get a large sum of money? - not officially, but... - but? - yes, you can count on it. - you know what i think of that? i think it's quite fantastic. it's damned good of you. well, it's not me personally, it's town hall. town hall thought out that we'd run into financial problems... who doesn't? and you drop in like manna from heaven! hi, miguel... say hello to the man from town hall. what's the matter with him? he's suffering from delusions. we've three napoleons here. - does that still go on? - yes, sadly. we've tried to eradicate it, but... you can imagine how much we spend on food alone. what's he so sad about? miguel, can you tell the guy from town hall why you're so sad? waterloo. waterloo? we really appreciate your coming all the way out here. no! axel, you're not pissing on an official vehicle again? i'm sorry: have you any jumper cables i could borrow? has he pissed on an official vehicle again? i'm really sorry. he doesn't mean it personally. it's a cure we have. we call it the soelleroed cure. he's got to learn. the red one on the right, ped. the black on the left. we'll give him shock therapy, the fucking retard. rev up, damn it! you'll need the police and dogs to get us out. soelleroed fascists! fascist pricks! soelleroed fascists! fucking fascists! cock suckers! town hall bastards! soelleroed fascists! shithead! soelleroed fascist! fucking soelleroed fascists! - you're stark raving mad. - fascist bastard! fucking fascists! calm down, stoffer. get him into the bus. gently does it.. i think he's hurt. fucking fascists... stoffer, calm down. that will fucking well do, stoffer. come on. up to bed. - you can't haul him up there. - you're pathetic. are you putting me in the padded cell? you are so fucking pathetic. you are really zinging. you need to relax. nana, will you get him a blanket? can't we put him in an ordinary bed? - stoffer, we have to tie you down. - you think i've gone really mad? are you scared now? - listen... - i won't hit anyone. you did before. i'm not the type who hits people. - ok, ok. - i don't hit people. want a drink? untie that one. fucking fascists! soelleroed fascists! soelleroed fascists! - stop it! - where's the belt? out of the lake, round the palm tree, into the lake. - surely it's not that difficult? - not so hard. - stop it, stoffer. - fascists, man. chill out! we'll loosen the flex and leave him here, ok? and you miss the family? i do, as a matter of fact. i don't know how i figured that i didn't want to see them again. i just think it's over. i don't think we can... find the same fine things that we found there. we can't find them again. i was the one who was with karen on the last day. and i was the one who said good-bye to her. music and dancing. lots of flags to cheer him up. did you sleep well? you might at least have tied me to a decent bed. - what are you doing? - making a party. - we thought we need a party. - a party? we're going to have a party? - that's right. - for me? yes. because it's my birthday? it's not my real birthday. well, we're not real retards, are we? may we come in? are you ready? - ticket. wow, what a rave! jeppe, look at the ticket and tear it in half. i'll do it, then... frrrt. now you can go in. come on... jeeze, things are really swinging. we're the ones the others can't play with we're the ones the others can't play with i think stoffer should choose what we do next. because it's his party. gang bang. no, listen, we've got picture lotto, spin the bottle... - gang bang. - i'll go for that. gang bang! gang bang! sure! i'd love a spasser fuck. gang bang! gang bang... hey, hey, hey! no, i'm not joining in. susanne! - come on... - no. yes... gang bang! - susanne. - they're my knickers. go over there. i'll sit and... stop it, stoffer. - i can't undo my... - can't you? stop it! stoffer, i don't want to. i'll go home. i'm not having this. i'm running away. home. stop it! i'm going home! go away. no! good-bye. - gang bang... gang bang... - yes... i'll give you gang bang! yes, suzanne! ok, i'll just take these off, too. i'm ready and waiting. katrine? want some? i love you. i love you. the room was full of style till you brought those lilos. they cost 7 bucks each. - a four-poster would be better. ped! there's no getting away from it. he smokes like hell, and it's getting worse as he gets older. - it's my father. - hello. - hello, dad. - hello, josephine. this is katrine and ped and axel. - hello. - would you like a cup of tea? - sit down. - yes, please. - i'm jeppe. - josy's father. stoffer... have a seat. you just happened to be passing? we have a little group. a tired group. - do you take sugar? - thanks. we are a bit tired. maybe you've heard of our group? no... - no. - oh. you make it sound like a rock band. maybe we should form one. that would be a great idea. what do you think? of us? - what do i think of you? - yes. well... they're nice people. they enjoy what they do. i'm sure they do. we're really, really happy. maybe you've heard about our little... i'm not interested in discussing what you do. i couldn't care less. couldn't care less? if you could see things differently you might see the beauty of them. in vino veritas... what the hell do you mean by that? i may be right. it doesn't interest me. - it doesn't? - no. why did you come, then? obviously an outsider can't see what it means. you should see some of the wonderful things we're shared. people are happy. they're thriving. - they are! - i'm not going to argue. we're not arguing. ask anyone if they're happy. josephine is happy here. - it certainly looks like it. - that's because you're here. she was fine until you came. but then you came crashing in. i am really happy here. - i've come to take you home. - no... you can't do that. yes. yes, i can. - you see, i can't trust you. - what do you mean? - bullshit. - what do you mean? you haven't been taking your pills. - we'd agreed she'd... - i have been taking them. damn it, josephine... the jar was in the drawer at home. i can't look after you unless... why should she take a load of fucking pills? i can't. - you're going through hell. - i'm not... i'm not. for the first time, i'm feeling really great. can't we find a compromise? listen... - we're fond of josephine. - listen! we don't like you. if you left there'd be no problem. she doesn't look as if she wants to go with you. listen... this may be a game to you. and good luck to you. but it takes nothing to make josephine seriously ill. keep your shirt on, i'm a doctor, i'd never permit... i don't think you're a doctor i'd choose to go to. i don't think so. come along, josephine. no, i don't want to go. if you've any bits and pieces, pop upstairs and get them. - i don't want to go home. - did you hear what i said? josephine... answer me... have you any? - yes. - go and get them, and we'll go. what the fuck can he do to you? stay here! all you have to do is say the word. he can't hurt you. what right's he got? - ped, what were those pills? - i know nothing about any pills. aren't you a doctor, damn it? you said you knew about it. - so what kind of pills is she on? - i don't know. - you must know. - she never mentioned pills. and she doesn't need pills. josephine, just stay! he can't do anything to you. stay here! - we can't force anybody to stay! - he's forcing her! it's their business. we can't cure anyone here. - that's not our aim. - aim? up yours, man! josephine... there should be a law against it. get out of here! she doesn't want to go with you. if you'd really been a proper father she'd have been all right today. we can't force anyone to stay against their will. jeppe! jeppe... jeppe... you're insane. insane in the head. you're insane. what are you doing? - move him! - we'll move him, damn you. no! no! go now, damn you! please get out of the way. no! deep breaths. all the way down. on your feet, now. stand back, i know how to deal with this. - stop being so aggressive. - you've no fucking idea. no idea. jeppe, baby... is there any booze in the house? is there any left over from the... - there's vodka in the cupboard. - and beer in the bathtub. please stop doing your nails. it kind of stresses me out. dr. doolittle is scribbling away ... it must be interesting, eh? will it result in a doctorate? - maybe. - got lots of pearls of wisdom? and how about henrik the art teacher? do you think your work's any good? ...it was an experiment. - an experiment? - i like the top one. and you feel you'll be more of an artist if you go a teeny bit mad? but not too much. just enough to be a proper artist. you've no bloody talent at any rate. - it isn't the way i'd imagined it. - you'd imagined it? your pathetic little spassing bit is the only thing that matters. if you'd opened your mouth outside, she would have stayed. - but now he's upstairs screaming. - she's right, stoffer. ped, henrik, jeppe and josephine are just as good retards as you. oh, now i've put my foot in it. i have no faith in you. the moment it starts hurting just a bit, you cop out. tell us what you expect of us, then. tell us what you want! for you to prove that you are really into the whole idea, axel, prove it. sod off home and spass. freaking out in soelleroed in no big deal. if you can go back to your families or jobs and still be a spasser, i'll believe you're serious. - none of you has the guts. - listen... stoffer is mocking us. mocking the idiots. of course we can go home and spass. or spass at work. otherwise it's worthless. either you're an idiot or you aren't. who's going first? come on. whoever the bottle points at... will go somewhere where the people you're with really matter. shut up, susanne, this is important. aren't you in on it? and jeppe and karen? i've never heard karen boast that she was a great spasser. that's jeppe. if it points over there... or here, i'm it. fine, i'll go back to mona and the baby and spass. or to the agency. in fact, that would be really, really awful for you. you just promised, man. you want me to flush my whole family life down the toilet? nobody's saying that. your sow of a wife will just have to learn to love your inner idiot. i can't. i can't. axel? come here a moment, axel. axel! another spin of the bottle, then. yes... when? this is for you. welcome back. thanks. henrik, i have a little question. have we done the obelisks? - the obelisks? oh, the odalisques! - is he going to spass or what? he's doing fuck all. i think it's time for us to consider... the calligraphy in matisse. primarily i mean ""les fleurs du mal"", 1944. oh, them? yeah, yeah, yeah. whether matisse was completely aware of his... effect on the bourgeoisie. he was certainly provocative and full of surprises. nobody could accuse you of that. i need some air. - hello! - yes? what's going on? fuck all. you love this middle-class crap. these old dames use more make-up than the national theatre. it's lovely to have henrik back, don't you think? what happened? we didn't come to hear about a french faggot and his calligraphy. it's too fucking bad. - i tried. - you coughed three times. - it wasn't that easy. - no. stoffer is right. it wasn't good enough. i had no pride in my inner idiot. i wasn't good enough. you did try. i'm not coming back with you. ok. ready yet? karen, my love. take care, now. take care. nana... let them go, karen. it was all lie. i have something i want to say. i just want to say... how happy i have been here. being an idiot with you is one of the best things i've ever done. jeppe... who is almost like a little child i might have had. and nana... who is so sweet and funny. and miguel... who has such lovely eyes. and ped, who is such a clever man. and strong, strong katrine. and susanne,... who smiles at everyone so that the very heavens shine down upon us. i believe... i love you all... more than i have ever loved anybody. maybe with one exception. but that was so long ago now. - what day is it tomorrow? - it's saturday. then it can be done. it is my turn to go home and see if i can be an idiot there. i suppose i'll need to take one of you along. but there isn't room for everyone. it may not be very pleasant. i think i'd like to take susanne. will you come? i'd like that. good. we'll see if i can show you that it has all been worthwhile. - hello, mother. - hello, karen. come in. shall i take your jacket? karen... where have you been? we thought you were dead. this is susanne. and my sister, britta. louise? karen came back. what do you want? i just wanted to see how you all here... this is susanne. anders is coming. yes, i suppose he is. karen, is that you? yes, grandpa. we haven't seen her for two weeks. not since the day before the funeral. anders and karen lost their little boy. it probably hurt anders most. what with her just disappearing and not attending the funeral. my pet... that'll be anders. - hello, grandpa - hello, anders. hello, anders. hello, karen. i'm sorry i couldn't come to... to martin's... funeral. it just means you aren't too upset. that's fine. louise? do begin. that's enough now, karen."
Von Trier,Melancholia,"part 1 justine sir... you can back up a little more if you want... i think you need that extra... i don't think he can hear you. sir, can you hear me up there? can you copy, sailor? i think he's in a different county... it's like five feet. and now he stops. he's got five feet here. that's good. stop, stop, stop, stop! wait, wait, wait! you're a little close. i think he can keep going a little bit, maybe. oh, no, no, no. he can't. i don't... be careful, please. it is not my car. i will. i promise. turn around to the left, please. stop there, sir. straighten up, sir. yeah, i think i'm good there, right? you're not even looking. i can see it's not looking good. i'm a very experienced driver... it's like really close on that side. really? yeah, don't go any further forward. just straight... how do i put it in...? what? this way? get out of the way. come on. sorry. yes, i know. we're sorry. i won't even bother saying how late you are. sorry. we're really sorry. hi. hi, claire. so sorry. hi. we probably should have taken something smaller. this brilliant idea was yours of renting a stretch. this is very much not my project, okay? i spent the whole week with the dullest man on earth. not to mention the most expensive wedding planner on the planet. okay, so you want this? yeah, of course. so, when you're there... and that was two hours ago. okay. all right, let's go. what star is that? i don't know. john, you're a bit of an expert on stars, aren't you? i wouldn't say that. oh, yes you would. which one are you looking at exactly? the red one. i'm amazed you can see that. that's antares. it's the main star in the scorpio constellation. justine ... we just have to go to the stables to say hello to abraham. no, you're not. oh, yes. who's abraham? abraham. look, i'm married. michael's my husband now. i'm sure you two will like each other. nice to meet you. i'm his mistress. i'm the only one who can ride him. that's not exactly true. what? occasionally i take her for a ride. see you later. i can no longer be silent. all the guests are waiting for more than two hours. i know. i'm at the end of my rope. welcome to the reception of mr. steinam, mr. marko. thank you. thank you, little father. would you be so good as to to participate in the wedding bean lottery? of course. please submit your bid as to the total number of beans in the bottle. yes, er... two million and six beans. two million and six beans. would you care to make a bid on behalf of your wife? oh, i don't dare to do that. i really don't. very well, we'll let madam's bid remain open. we made it. hi, mom. love that dress. congratulations aunt steelbreaker. thanks, leo. what's this? a dagger. wow! sweetheart. let me introduce you. this is betty... and betty. betty and betty, this is my daughter, justine. hi, nice to meet you. i'm gonna say hi to everybody. of course, of course. ladies and gentlemen ... we waited a while for this. a toast to the bride and the groom. justine and michael. the tray must go left to right ... from left to right. justine, i don't want to make a speech. why? please. what are you doing? you'll see. excuse me. neither of the ladies sitting next to me has been given a spoon. i'd like very much to have one. excuse me. you're terrible. waiter. justine, would you mind slapping your father for me hard, please. tim. justine, listen up, goddammit. as most of you know, i'm here tonight playing sort of a double role. on michael's side, i'm best man. and, coincidentally, i'm also the employer of the bride. i've got nothing bad to say about the groom, but... the bride ... justine ... gorgeous woman ... where's my tagline? you were always great in coming up with a tagline in a hurry. what happened? did your emotional life suddenly take over? did finding the man of your life render you unable to work? i'm just asking because if i were to choose between a woman for my dear friend michael and an employee... i would always choose the employee. advertising, justine, advertising. justine, you were way, way, way too good for advertising. you know it, i know it, we all know it. so thank you for staying with it. i'm gonna let you and the rest of you think about this tagline now while i leak a bit of news. today the company hasn't lost a copywriter ... the company has gained a new art director. and that's you, justine. congratulations. goddammit, you earned it. the father of the bride wants a word. my dear girl, you look... glowing today. and me, i'm just a little confused what with all the bettys at my table. never seen you look so happy. so, what can say without talking about your mother? my wife of yesteryear. which is exactly what i don't wish to do. i don't think that i would be revealing any secret if i were to say that she can be very domineering at times. domineering? what a load of crap! for those who don't know who i am, i'm claire and justine's mother. justine, if you have any ambition at all, it certainly doesn't come from your father's side of the family. yes. i wasn't at the church. i don't believe in marriage. claire, whom i have always taken for a sensible girl, you've arranged a spectacular party. till death do us part and forever and ever... justine and michael. i just have one thing to say ... enjoy it while it lasts. i myself hate marriages. gaby, please. especially when they involve my closest family members. why did you even bother coming? justine, come with me. listen to me. we agreed that you weren't going to make any scenes tonight. the don't want any scenes. no, we don't! no. look at me when i'm talking to you. but i didn't do anything. you know what i mean. okay. okay. katherine has demanded the floor. where is the bride? i've looked everywhere, no bride. now the groom is going to give a speech for the bride. dear justine... what are you doing to me? i 've never given a speech before. i'm serious, i've never given a speech before. justine is the speaker. she can say the most wonderful things, but ... then let her make the speech, damn it. justine... i love you so much... and never dreamed that i would have such a gorgeous wife. i believe that i'm the luckiest man on earth. i love you. that's kind of it. that's all i have. hello, everyone, we're going to move to the living room so that we can clear some tables. then the newlyweds will dance. and then, at eleven thirty, the bride and groom will cut the cake in here. he wants to be put to bed. sweety, you did so good. i wanna do it. no, tonight's your night. no, please. are you sure? yeah, come on. good night, sweetheart. come on, come here. are you comfortable? when are we gonna build caves together? we're gonna build lots of caves together. just not  tonight. you're still my aunt steelbreaker, aren't you? yes. it's exactly who i am. justine ... hi, claire. i'm just taking a little nap. don't nap, it's your wedding. you're not even halfway through yet. no. you're right. i have to pull myself together. what's going on, justine? i'm trudging in through this... praying really hard. it's clinging to my legs. it's really heavy to drag along. no, you're not. i know you'll hate to hear it. don't say a word to michael. you think i'm stupid? i'll get her. and my mom, too. yeah. justine, it's john. we're ready to cut the cake, sweetheart. please come downstairs as soon as you can, okay? gaby... gaby... gaby, i'm sorry to disturb you, but we're ready to cut the cake. when justine took her first crap on her potty, i wasn't there. when she had her first sexual intercourse, i wasn't there. so give me a break, please, with all your fucking rituals. unbelievable, fucking unbelievable. everyone, thank you for being so patient. we're just having a little issue with the wedding dress. she'll be right down. those bitches have locked themselves in their bedrooms and now they're taking a bath. is everybody in your family stark raving mad? this is embarrassing. i know. we should have put showers in the guest wing. i've said it a hundred times. for fuck's sakes, if people want to linger in a bath, stay at home. here we offer you an 18 hole golf course, where else would they get that? nowhere. unbelievable! that's it, she's out. what, justine? your mother. unbelievable. she ruined my wedding. i will not look at her. outstanding. my god, we cut it. i'm sorry. no, don't say that. you should never say you're sorry. i can see that you're not feeling well tonight. you should have seen you weren't ready yesterday. i haven't been taking care of you lately. it's my fault. can we talk somewhere? of course. sit down, please. i wasn't going to give you this until tomorrow. i found our plot of land. they call it empire apples. they're bright red and very sweet. but with the perfect tartness. i had one as a kid. beautiful, huh? in ten years' time, when the trees have grown you can sit in the shade, in a chair. if you still have days when you're feeling a little sad ... i think that will make you happy again. it's very sweet. yeah? no wonder you've been so busy. i signed the deed for it yesterday, i didn't want to tell you. here. no, you should have it, i want you to have it with you all the time and hold on to it. so you can look at it once in a while. i'll always keep with me. maybe we can have a little swing hanging from one of the trees. we'll talk about that when the time comes. yeah, no... of course. when the time comes. goodbye. you'd better be goddamn happy. yes, i should be. i really should be. do you have any idea how much this party cost me? a ballpark figure? no. i don't. should i? yes, i think you should. a great deal of money. a huge amount of money. in fact, for most people, an arm and a leg. i hope you feel it's well spent. well, that depends on whether or not we have a deal. a deal? yes, a deal. that you'll be happy. yes, of course. of course we have a deal. good. congratulations. i tried to throw your mother out. yes, you usually do. yes, i do. thank you. it's a wonderful party you've given me. how many holes are on our golf course? eighteen. that's right. happy? yeah. this is the young man. congratulations. thank you. i'm tim. hi, tim. tim started working for us two days ago. he happens to be my nephew, but ignore that. tim thought i wouldn't be able to squeeze that tagline out of you tonight. i thought it might be difficult. you're colleagues. i hired him the moment i heard about his education. what education is perfect if you want to make it in public relations? tim? none at all, of course. it was almost too perfect. he knows nothing. i hired him on the spot. and at a very good salary. what do you say, tim? a very good salary. welcome, then, tim. there's just a slight catch to a very good job with a very good salary. the salary is very good. why, what are you pushing tim into doing? to get that damn tagline out of you tonight. otherwise he's out on his ear, which sucks, considering the debts he's in. goodbye. once you give her a job, she won't let go. you gotta be there at the time of birth, so you follow her now. i mean, get that tagline. do let me know if the tagline's there and i'll jot it down. spare me. i'll go out for a minute. i'm really sorry. i'm thrilled about this wedding and i know it's costing john a lot of money. john's filthy mouth... he needs to shut up about it. it 's not about the cost. it's just that i thought you really wanted this. but i do. michael has tried to get through to you all evening to no avail. that's not true. i smile and smile and smile ... you're lying to all of us. don't you miss this? what do you want in this place? you 've no business here. nor have i. your sister, it seems, is somewhat bewitched by you. mom... i'm a bit scared. a bit? i'd be scared out of my wits if i were you. no, it's something else, i... i'm frightened, mom. i have trouble walking properly. you can still wobble, i see. so just wobble the hell out of here. stop dreaming, justine. i'm scared. we all are, sweetie. just forget it. get the hell out of here. no, thanks. everybody, excuse me. could you all follow us outside, please. betty, betty, betty ... another glass, please. are you really called betty? no sir, sorry. don't worry about it. dad, can we talk? could you sit with me for a little while? wait. what? wait. get out of me. michael, can you give me a moment? what's happened? just give me a moment, please. what's happened? can i have a moment, please? yeah... of course. can you zip me? are you okay? okay. hi. good night. have a good time. i'm on my way home, my darling. please, dad, i really need to talk to you. little father ... my dad would like to spend the night. is there a room available? room number eight is vacant. we could prepare that for your father. well .. yes, my father likes that. then we can have breakfast in the morning. justine... why don't you come and have onion soup with us? tim. get us some soup. how's your wonderful night going? it's too bad about tim. what about tim? he got fired. he didn't last many hours in the business, but ... then again, it's a rather unpredictable one, you're king one day and beggar the next. so you go back to wherever you came from, right buddy? i'm glad we found each other, jack. i was looking for you. didn't i tell you? she can't stop working, not even on your wedding night. i had nothing at the dinner ... but i've been playing with an idea for a small campaign. the problem is, how do we effectively hook a group of minors on our substandard product, preferably in a habit-forming way? and i've reached a conclusion in regards to the tagline. i was just thinking, what if ... instead... we try to sell you to the public, jack? then, surprisingly, i arrived right back where i started from. at nothing. nothing? it's not such a bad tagline, jack. would my newly fledged aide please expand a little on the thoughts of the tagline? nothing is too much for you, jack. i hate you and your firm so deeply i couldn't find the words to describe it. you are a despicable, power-hungry little man, jack. is that a resignation? 'cause there aren't too many jobs out there, i tell you. i broke my plate. so i... i guess we'll... take off now. yes. this could have been a lot different. yes, michael, that have been. but, michael ... what did you expect? yeah. you're right. claire... sometimes, i hate you so much. the way i see it, you're now short of a boss and a husband. could i, in all my humility, offer my services? you have the ideas, i have the head for business. we could be the perfect couple. we've had good sex. i don't think that's a very good idea. no. no. excuse me, the result is ready. what? the number of beans in the bottle has been arrived at. and? six hundred and seventy-eight. that's the final count. six hundred and seventy-eight? and none of the guests got it right. really? some were pretty close, but no one guessed right. incredible. you could say that. incredibly trivial. but that's the result of the competition. and a lot of people would like to know the result. and then there is the prize. throw it away. dad... to my beloved daughter, betty. i'm as proud of you as any father could be. but i couldn't find you and i was offered a ride home i couldn't refuse. see you soon. kisses from your stupid dad. justine, wake up. wake up. we're going for a ride. i tried, claire. yes, you did. you really did. come on. come on, abraham, come. come on, lets go. come on! the red star is missing from scorpio. antares is no longer there. part 2 claire i swear to god, your sister can't do anything by herself. hello, darling. how are you? just do as i've told you. there's a taxi down the street waiting for you. i already told her that. just open the door, and get in. unbelievable. just get in the cab, darling. well, then call me back if you can't make it to the cab. we'll pay for it when you arrive. don't worry about it. we'll see about that. i love you, darling. please, john, she's my sister. oh, please! she's a bad influence on you and leo. she's ill. right. have you been going online again? claire, you promised. i'm afraid of that stupid planet. that stupid planet? that wonderful planet, you mean. first it was black, now it's blue. blocking antares, hiding behind the sun. darling, this is going to be the most amazing experience we will have in our lives. it won't be here in five days, and it is not going to hit us. just like it didn't hit mercury, as we knew it wouldn't. and it didn't hit venus, as we well knew it wouldn't. and it won't hit earth, as we know it won't. claire, look at me. sweetheart, you have to trust a scientist. they say that it will hit... no they don't, that's not true. not the real scientists. now, the prophets of doom they'll write whatever they can to get attract attention. but the real scientists, all of them agree. melancholy is just gonna pass right in front of us. and it's gonna be the most beautiful sight ever. now, i wish you'd watch it through the telescope with me. please. no, i'd better not. son of a bitch. when are we going to build those caves, aunt steelbreaker? sweetheart, not right now. we're gonna do that in a little while. okay? she's still sleeping. yes, but she has to get up now. what are you making? meatloaf. meatloaf? yes. if that's doesn't get her out of bed, nothing will. time to wake up, justine. no more sleeping. going to take you to a nice bath. how would you like that? come on. you 'll see you'll like it. i promise. come on. i'll wash you, okay? just lift your foot. go on. lift your foot. you need a bath. you need to wash. right? i'm so tired ... come on, try. i can not. justine, you'll like it. see? it's nice, it's a nice bath. justine ... please. okay, so... we've practiced for tomorrow. and i have a surprise for you for dinner. can you smell it? meatloaf? surprise! it tastes like ashes. it's all right, sis. auntie  steelbreaker's crying. don't worry, son. do you want to go back up? may i be excused? take one more bite. look. it's a planet that has been hiding behind the sun. and now it passes by us. it's called a fly by. it's not something you need to frighten aunt steelbreaker with now. if you think i'm afraid of a planet, then you're too stupid. just a few things we're gonna need in case of melancholy gets really close. look, i'd really appreciate it if you didn't mention this to claire. she gets anxious so easily. come on, justine. take it. that's it. come on, justine, take him out. justine, take him out! come on. come on! come on! don't beat him! come on! justine, don't beat him! stop. there it is. there's your fly by. you don't touch the instrument. come on leo. look. our son has invented a very fine device. if you adjust the steel and point it towards the planet from your chest it'll tell you how fast it's approaching and ultimately how fast it will recede. okay. leo... what are we excited about? tomorrow night. that's right. wow, that's amazing. amazing isn't it? let me look. earth & melancholia dance of death john! john! coming. we're prepared for this. the power will be back on in a few days. claire... tomorrow evening melancholy will pass us by and you'll never have to see it again, okay? so it won't hit us? not a chance. what if your scientists have miscalculated and... they haven't. you promise? of course i do. i promise. it's rising again. just like the moon. because of the earth's rotation. exactly like they said it would. are you hungry?  no, thanks. are you okay? yeah. do you plan to kill us all? maybe i should take those. don't touch them. don't you touch them. justine, come and have a bath. i've had a bath. really? yes, i'm very clean. little father didn't come to work. i checked the noteboard. he didn't leave one. i tried to call him, but maybe something's wrong with the phone. you see, it's never happened before that he didn't come to work without giving us notice. does he have a family? he lives in the village... i do not know if he has a family. maybe this is a time when he needs to be with them. it'll pass us by tonight. john is quite calm about it. does that calm you down? yes, of course. well, john studies things. he always has. the earth is evil. we don't need to grieve for it. what? nobody will miss it. but where would leo grow up? all i know is ... life on earth is evil. there may be life somewhere else. no, there isn't. how do you know? because i know things. oh, yes, you always imagine, you did. i know we're alone. i don't think you know that at all. six hundred and seventy-eight. the bean lottery. nobody guessed the amount of beans in the bottle. no, that's right. but i know. six hundred and seventy-eight. well, perhaps... what does that prove? that i know things. and when i say we're alone... we're alone. life exists only on earth. and not for long. i can stay up all evening till the middle of the night... when we get to see the planet fly by, and i get to look at the telescope. yes, of course, darling. but are you sure you can stay up that late? you haven't slept much lately. yes, i can. can't i, auntie steelbreaker? can't i? yes, you can. of course you can. it's eleven. it's almost here. leo, sweetheart. it's time to wake up. leo. leo. there. leo should be watching this. my god. there. take a look. are you afraid? no, it looks... it looks friendly. yes. that's what i've been trying to explain to you. my god. i'd like to raise a toast. to life. to life? what do you mean, to life? you said it was going to be okay. there was no sense in alarming everybody. so, you're saying that our lives were in danger? no, i was saying... no, i'm saying that when dealing with science and calculations of this magnitude... you have to account for a margin of error. that's all i'm saying. i'm sorry. it's not fun any more. actually it's moving away from us as we speak. you just can't see it through the naked eye. come here. put this to your chest. aim it up at the planet. hold on. is that right? yes. in five minutes... it'll be smaller. i can't breathe. just relax, relax. this is normal. it's taking part of our atmosphere. for a little while, it's gonna make us winded. just try and breathe calmly. just breathe. just breathe. there you go. just try to breathe calmly. there you go. please, can i look now? of course. it's smaller. of course it is. it's smaller! it's smaller! sure. of course it is. it's moving away from us at over sixty thousand miles an hour. for heaven's sake... come here. mom... we have to stay up... i wanna look through the telescope ... breathe calmly. be happy, please. if i dare, you can do it. i'm happy you're happy. you have it easy, don't you? i imagined the worst thing possible. that's right, claire. sometimes it's easy being me. hi, darling. do you want tea? no, thank you. something to drink? john! john! john! john. john. john. john! i can't find john. do you know where he is? no. i was just listening. there's something different. the horses... they've come down. john... good morning, mom. get a blanket. justine, breakfast. where's john? he rode to the village. why didn't he just take the car? abraham needed a ride. since you never ride him. come with me. justine ... come! claire... claire. dammit... what...? claire. where are you going? to the village. come. this has nothing to do with the village. get in! i want us to be together when it happens. outside on the terrace. help me, justine. i want to do this the right way. better do it quickly. a glass of wine together, maybe? you want me to have a glass of wine on your terrace? yes, would you do it, sis? how about a song? beethoven's ninth ... something like that? perhaps we could light some candles. you just want us all to gather on your terrace sing a song and have a glass of wine... the three of us. yes, that would make me happy. do you know what i think of your plan? no. i only think that he might like it. i think it's a piece of shit. justine, please... i just wanted to be nice. nice? why don't we meet in the fucking toilet? then let's not. you're damn right, let's not. sometimes i hate you so much, justine. i'm afraid that the planet will hit us, anyway. don't be... please. dad said there is nothing to do, then... nowhere to hide. if your dad said that, then he's forgotten about something. he's forgotten about the magic cave. the magic cave... yep. is that something everybody can make? aunt steelbreaker can. all right, let's go find stick, all right? hold my hand. close your eyes."
Von Trier,Nymphomaniac II,"   seligman: this is nothing less than ""zeno's paradox."" you are achilles and the tortoise is the orgasm. - oh, come on. - no, no, no. listen. achilles and the tortoise are going to race, and achilles is confident, so he gives the tortoise a hundred meters head start. now the mathematical problem is that before achilles can pass the tortoise, he has to reach the point where the tortoise started after a hundred meters. but when achilles gets there, the tortoise has already moved on, and then he has to reach the next point, and the tortoise has moved on again and so on and so on and so on. so achilles can never reach the tortoise and never pass him. and in the same way, because you were giving chase, you couldn't reach satisfaction. that's the paradox. i'm sorry, but it seems as if you're not taking this very seriously. i'm telling you about the worst thing that's happened to me, that i at that point, within seconds, lost all sexual sensation. my cunt simply went numb. and immediately we have to hear about this ridiculous mathematical problem. in fact, i'm in doubt whether you're even listening. why do you doubt that? this is not a story i've told in its entirety before, but whenever i've told other men about experiences, episodes in my sex life, it was easy to see that they became quite excited. i got excited. yes, about the mathematical crap, not about the story. what kind of a person are you, actually? i... you wouldn't know. no, but i can guess. why didn't i get that earlier? the fact you don't get excited over my dirty stories is because you can't relate to them. you've never been with a woman. that's quite accurate. not with a man, either. are you sorry about that? well, yeah, out of curiosity... not out of lust, as you would think. i consider myself asexual. of course, i experimented with masturbation when i was a teenager, but it didn't do much for me. so, there's nothing sexual about me. it's not as uncommon as you would think. and of course, i've read a lot about sexual subjects... ""canterbury tales"","" decameron"", ""thousand and one nights"". you name it and i've read it with great interest and enjoyment, but only literary enjoyment. but... but i think maybe it makes me a better listener to your story, and... i have no preconceived notions or preferences. i'm actually the best judge you could give your story to. and when it comes to deciding whether you're a bad human being or not, i'm... i've no problems with that. because i don't look at you through the glasses colored by sexuality or sexual experience. i'm a virgin. i'm innocent. she's looking at me. yes. joe: it's an icon. is it russian? yes, it's, uh... it's a skilled copy, maybe in the manner of rublev. icons are usually connected to the eastern church. joe: the eastern church? i might become a bit theoretical. you may. i'd like you to tell me about your picture. although the christian church was split up in 1054 because of differences in opinion between the eastern church and the western church, what we today call the orthodox church and the roman catholic church, this is a typical eastern church icon. it usually depicts the virgin mary and the infant jesus and more rarely, for instance, the crucifixion, which in the western church was much more prevalent. if you generalize, you could say that the western church is the church of suffering, and the eastern church is the church of happiness. why is she looking right at me? seligman: well, she's telling a story. icons were originally a kind of pictorial bibles for the illiterate. there are some who say you... you read an icon, even write it. there are different types of icons. this is a hodegetria. the directions are very important. she's looking at you, but she's pointing at the baby jesus. and he's looking at you and pointing at her. do you see how flat it is? there's no... no perspective. it's because it's an image of eternity. and eternity isn't in 3-d. but you said the eastern church was the church of joy? yeah, the sanctities of the eastern church were all about the joy of faith while the western church wallowed in... in suffering and death. if you imagine a... a mental journey from rome eastward, you feel how you move away from guilt and pain towards joy and light. but you say you didn't believe in god. no, but the concept of religion is interesting. like the concept of sex. but you won't find me on my knees with regards to either. let's call this chapter, ""the eastern church and the western church."" but it won't be... it won't be a story about traveling east from rome towards the light, but rather the opposite. so, in order not to make it too sad, i've pepped up the name of the chapter with an extra title.  joe: i have to go back a bit. i was 12 years old and on a school trip in the hills. - are you making fun of me? - what do you mean? you have this orgasm, not only an orgasm - but a spontaneous orgasm. - yes, it was an orgasm, though the doctor described it as an epileptic seizure. and during that orgasm, you had this vision? of these two women on each side of you. the woman on my right side seemed to be dressed in purple and scarlet with a lot of gold and pearls. she was carrying a golden goblet in her hand. she was sitting on some strange animal. and then the other woman was dressed in roman clothes, a baby on her arm and her hair lay in tight waves beneath a veil. was she holding the veil with two fingers like this? seligman: and the other woman, was she sitting on an animal with seven heads and ten horns? the animal only had one head. it was kind of a bull. what's the matter? you're making this up. no, i'm not. i'm telling you about my first orgasm, which came upon me without the slightest touch in some strange ways up in the mountains. i never had achieved an orgasm before, even though i masturbated as if my life depended on it during that time. your story is like a... blasphemous retelling of the transfiguration of jesus on the mount, which is one of the eastern church's holiest passages. it's when the humanity of christ is illuminated by the divine light of eternity. jesus, peter and two disciples had climbed a mountain. and suddenly, the disciples see this light emanating from jesus' head. and moses and elijah appear by his side. and they hear the voice of god, calling him his son. the relationship between... between the two women and you would be the same as the relation between moses and elijah and jesus. and that's where it becomes blasphemous. i see. you don't even... you don't even know who these women were, do you? no, but one of them did look like the virgin mary, now that you mention it. well, it wasn't the virgin mary, i can tell you that. from your description, it must've been valeria messalina, the wife of emperor claudius, the most notorious nymphomaniac in history. i thought she looked like your icon. we have that image from a statue in the louvre. it's made like a hodegetria, but it's not a religious person, far from it. and the other woman, the one astride the creature, that was no one else but the great whore of babylon, riding on nimrod in the form of a bull. if anyone else would've told me that story, i would've seen it as a blasphemous joke, spiced up with a biblical light emanating from nothing less than a spontaneous orgasm. goodness gracious. you demand a lot of your listener. i promise you i'm as innocent in regards to the religious as you are when it comes to sex. the transfiguration on the venus mount. and then later, you lost your orgasm altogether. seligman: wagner. ""das rheingold"". the descent into nibelheim. was it that bad? joe: try to imagine that in one fell swoop, you lost all desire to read and all your love and passion for books and letters. i don't even know if i can imagine that. can i help you? joe: but as so often before in my life, a bit of hope sprang from a mystical event. seligman: which was? joe: three dead leaves performing a strange ballet. seligman: that gave you hope? for what? - joe: for regaining my sexuality. - seligman: how? joe: to claim it by force. joe: in spite of my tireless efforts, my cunt totally failed to respond. but the fact that the initiative had shifted seemed to encourage jerome greatly. and i have to admit there came a time when we had fun together. i'll give you a fiver. if you can put this... up inside your cunt. - joe: a fiver? - right. shit. - thank you. - waiter: you're welcome. - didn't you get any spoons? - no, we didn't. so what does this tell us? that love and sex have nothing to do with each other, or... or that they decidedly work against one another? the most grotesque thing was that it was during that period, where every sexual sensation was denied me, a period, i must admit, of secure and restful domestic comfort. we had moved in together and so on, that i became pregnant, because i was careless about my birth control pills. joe: consciously or unconsciously, it was important for me to have a caesarean. i mean, i was hoping that my cunt was going to fucking work again, and i had a feeling that a haphazard birth wouldn't make things better. i may have been imagining things, but as i lay there, the noise from the instruments rang out in a chord like the one from the little flock. yes. and it wasn't fear. more like a kind of disgust. i could've sworn i saw him laughing. a laughing son. in ""doctor faustus"", thomas mann describes the birth of noah's son ham, who was laughing when he was born. another satanic omen. incidentally, the innocent child was named marcel after mars, the roman god of war. and motherhood? i assume maternal love didn't quite live up to its expectations. no, i didn't have any expectations. and maternal love wasn't a problem. it was just that each time i looked into the child's eyes, i had this unsettling feeling of having been found out. joe: it's probably a strange thing to say about a child... that my love wasn't being returned. but it was my perception. if jerome had hoped for a break from what was for him now mostly strenuous work, he could forget about it. achilles was again chasing the tortoise. - fill all my holes. - i can't, joe. i'm sorry. i'm trying. - can we talk a bit? - of course. i love you. i love your wildness and your desire. i love you, joe. at the moment, i don't seem to satisfy you in the way that i'd like to. don't get upset, joe. it doesn't mean we won't continue with our sex life, which is very important to me. very important to me. when you buy a tiger, right, you also have to feed it. um, satisfy it, right? long story short. i have a tiger on my hands. - you mean i'm too much for you. - no. you're just the way you should be. i was just thinking if you would consider that i get a little help with the feeding, that's all. you're saying i should have sex with others as well. that's a rather cruel way of putting it, joe, but... - joe: but exact. - jerome: exact. joe: for a long time i'd been playing around with the idea that the concept of the fuck-me-now clothes could be improved. you look nice. joe: and became the piano teacher. - driver: you okay? - joe: no. - driver: what's the matter? - well, i'm such an idiot with cars. i don't really know what to do. do you mind helping me? driver: of course it won't work. the spark plug caps have been removed. yes, i did that. was that wrong? joe: for the first time i had the pleasure of having an eight-cylinder car. the possible combinations of eight spark plug caps on eight spark plugs are 40,320, if i remember my math correctly. and only one of these will make the car run, which gave me all the time i needed. man: beethoven, huh? he was certainly very good, but, you know, he couldn't write a fugue. - joe: you think so? - well, yeah, i think so. it would be more precise to say that beethoven renewed the fugue. that he was such a visionary that the old bach purists, they accused him of not mastering it. good day? joe: not one word was ever spoken between me and jerome about my piano lessons. joe: the first time the mysterious letters addressed to me arrived, i, of course, feared that they were love letters from someone i'd completely forgotten about and hid them, so as not to hurt jerome if he should see them. but as jerome was always somehow present when i would get the mail, and as the envelopes were always empty, i understood that the letters, in fact, were sent by jerome himself as a way of testing me. my decision not to show them to him was exactly the reaction he had feared, and it reaffirmed his insane jealousy and his fantasies of the countless times i would fall in love for real while being the piano teacher. joe: and now to reach the heart of your suffering western church, i have to jump ahead three years in the story and talk about my meeting with what i would call ""the dangerous men."" i was alone with marcel a lot during this period, as jerome was traveling most of the time, and when he was finally home, he spent most of the time accusing me of neglecting marcel, which, in my opinion, was just a cover for his anger over my lovers. despite my, to put it mildly, promiscuous initiatives, any sexual satisfaction, let alone orgasm, was further away than ever before. joe: i had to make a change. and somehow, the inspiration had been right there beneath my window the whole time. i'd planned to go where i would never before had dreamt of going. for instance, to be with a man with whom i shared no spoken language. i could feel that it turned me on enormously to imagine a sexual situation in which verbal communication was impossible. - hello. - hello. i'm tobias, the interpreter. hello, i'm joe. come in. i understand that you mastered the african languages. i do have a basis. who and what needs interpretation? um, that man. the one with the green jacket. what language is being spoken? well, god knows. i... all i know is that he doesn't speak english. tobias: it's quite difficult. but, uh, we did manage to find a dialect, of which we both had some knowledge. you coming? no, i'll stay here, and the two of you communicate. you are to ask him if he wants to have sex with me. - tobias: sex? - mm-hmm. - is it a go? - it's hard to say. i've written down the time and place, but, um... honestly, i wouldn't like to take responsibility for the precise wording in this case, which i think, uh, accidentally may belong to a grey zone in my profession. joe: it was the address of a cheap hotel. seligman: why were there two? joe: my words exactly. apparently, n had brought his brother along. seligman: why was he so angry? joe: clearly, it was something personal between them, but later i heard that performing a sandwich requires great sensitivity, since the men apparently can feel each other through the tissue. i imagine the quarrel had already started on the stairs and that one or the other party had laid claim to one or the other of my holes in conflict with his negro brother's interests. you shouldn't use that word. it's not what you call politically correct. negro. well, excuse me, but in my circles, it's always been a mark of honor to call a spade a spade. each time a word becomes prohibited, you remove a stone from the democratic foundation. society demonstrates its impotence in the face of a concrete problem by removing words from the language. the book burners have nothing on modern society. i think society would claim that politically correctness is a very precise expression of democratic concern for minorities. and i say that society is as cowardly as the people in it who, in my opinion, are also too stupid for democracy. i understand your point, but i totally disagree. i have no doubt in the human qualities. the human qualities can be expressed in one word: hypocrisy. we elevate those who say right but mean wrong, and mock those who say wrong but mean right. society is based on hate. it should be based on forgiveness. hatred is rudimentary. one should be able to forgive one's executioner. by the way, i can assure you that women who claim that negros don't turn them on are lying. so, did they satisfy you? those ne... negros. no, but they showed me that there was a world far from mine i had to explore. and there, or perhaps on the other side get my life back. man: who are you? i know what you do. i'd like to be one of the women you see. that's of no interest. madame. princess, i specifically said five days, and five days haven't gone yet. so, you'll have to leave. sorry. you still here? i, uh... i don't think this is for you. shall we conduct a small test? stand up. sit down, please. i just want you to sit completely relaxed while i hit you in the face. nothing special. it's just a... it's just a slap. you ready? i'm ready. no! see? seligman: how mysterious. will you give me a reasonable explanation now, or shall we wait? i can't give you an explanation and certainly not a reasonable one. what exactly were the rumors about him? - that he was violent. - how can that be exciting? i think the easiest way to understand it is to refer to my rebellious nature. this business of k's was something i was completely against. so, the fact that i was now contacting him was a last, desperate attempt to rehabilitate my sexuality. the system was the overriding factor with k. a system of violence? well, you were the one who insisted on the western church, right? and i... i seem to remember that the systematic approach to the crucifixion is of a violent and not to say sadistic nature. oh yes, the passion of christ is full of systematic violence. the via dolorosa, the nine stations of the cross, and the 39 lashes. you are beginning to irritate me. let me tell you the rules, then. the first rule is that i don't fuck you, and there isn't any discussions about that. then, what do you get out of it? that's my business, and i don't mean to mention it again. the second rule is that we have no safe word, meaning that if you, uh, go inside with me, there is nothing that you can say that will make me stop any plan or procedure. you must bring a brown, used leather riding crop. and not one from a shop selling sex toys. it's not a masquerade. third rule... if i choose to let you in, you have to be sitting out here. in other words, you... you won't know when. only that it would be some time between 2:00 and 6:00 at night. i can't stay here that late. my babysitter's not reliable, and i can't leave my child. you don't even know my name! i'm not interested in your name. here, your name is... fido. can i help you? i'd like to buy a riding crop. - for what? - for my horse. yes, i understand that part. what kind of horse? well, it's not very big. no, i just meant is the whip for dressage or for jumping? i don't know. this is a dressage whip. well, it's probably for jumping, then. okay. like this? - is it used? - no. we do have used whips, but these are not that expensive. i prefer a used one. okay. woman: marcel's awake. do you want to say goodbye to your mom? goodbye. man: fido... i'll take your coat. i'd like you to have your hair up. you can use this. just in case it becomes necessary for me to hit you in the face. should i take my clothes off? i'll tell you what to do and when. you may sit down. give me your hand. i wanna see what this knot looks like on your wrist. okay. you may get up. - now you may bend down. - how? approach the chair. now bend from the hips. look forward. look forward. with your head up. head up. keep looking forward. keep looking forward. you may stand up. we have to use the couch. come and sit. take it easy. take it easy. bend over. lay your arms out straight. take it easy. take it easy. bring your hands out straight. palms facing each other. take it easy. next time, don't wear knickers. your ass is not high enough. i don't think we can do this today. what? i'd like to see you again on thursday. what's wrong? i think we should see how it goes on thursday. answering machine: hi, i can't come to the phone right now. - please, leave a message. - yes, this is marcel's mother again. it's now 1:30. we had an agreement. i hope you get this message and come as quickly as you can. ah, marcel is sleeping. uh... i have to go now. raise yourself up. even further. better. also so much better. so much better. i am now going to hit you 12 times, no matter how much you scream 'cause no one can hear you down here. that's, uh, that's not how it goes. most people don't scream until i hit them. that's it. - thank you. - you're very welcome. hello? are you there? it's just all so very strange. yes. very, very strange. because i was wetter the second time. there's no doubt about it. i don't know where we get our sexuality from or where tendencies of this kind come from. probably a perversion created in our childhood that never manifested itself before. well, oddly enough, freud says the opposite. he talks about the polymorphic perversion of a child, meaning that in a child, all kinds of perversions exist. and then we use the childhood to diminish or remove some of them. basically, a child is sexually polymorphic, and everything is sexuality in an infant. and yet it was deeply bizarre to lie there and especially to want to lie there. i felt invincible. but mostly, i felt like a potted plant. potted plant? yes, because he was constantly checking my cunt juice. the way old ladies check their potted plant to see if they need watering. it is an interesting point that you actually lubricated in expectation for a pain that you hadn't experienced. your body prepared itself for an intercourse that you knew wouldn't happen. joe: i can only describe the mood as sexual. despite k's immature appearance, his methods were surprisingly refined. as i twisted and turned while he was whipping me, i could feel how clever his knots were. if i fought them, they would get tighter, and as i relaxed, it seemed they did, too. like a cat playing with a mouse. fooling it to believe it has a chance of escape and then attacking it again. i don't know what kind of knot k used, but i know of a knot that tightens when force is exerted and vice versa. it's called a prusik knot. it's after a man called prusik. he was a mountain climber, and he and a friend were out climbing and they had an accident, and his friend died. and he ended up hanging at the end of a rope with no possibility of getting up. you know, you can't climb up a mountain climber rope. it's too thin. but he was an intelligent man, and with his back to the wall, he was a genius. and he took the shoelaces out of his boots and made two loops and affixed them to the rope. and he could move these up when they weren't under tension. and then he could step into them and climb the rope and save himself. prusik. i think this was one of your weakest digressions. - may i continue? - be my guest. tomorrow bring 15 small coins, all the same. no more, no less. i sometimes give a christmas present. but uh, you have to do the work yourself. i'm going to show you how to do it. this is called a blood knot. you have to make nine ropes with three blood knots on each. let me see you do it. you decide whether to make four, five, or six turns on the various knots. let me see. that's fine. if you... if you start with one knot at the top of the rope, and then you have to put two more knots at a distance of... well, between 10 and 20 centimeters to be exact, but the most important thing with blood knots on the nine ropes is that they are placed differently and that they are staggered. the cat-o-nine-tails is often called the ""captain's daughter"" aboard ships. the blood knot is important because those are the ones that break the skin and not, as erroneously thought, the end of the rope. a gallows knot is also a kind of a blood knot with many turns. the american military standard demanded five to 15 turns, as it was the turns placed behind the left ear of the delinquent that would break the neck of the condemned as he fell. i'll take it from here. joe? love? marcel? marcel. - are you fond of me still? - yes. more fond of me than the others? - yes? - yes. you're not thinking of leaving again tonight, are you? - joe: no. - no? - joe: no, no. not at all. - you sure? joe: yeah. are you lying to me, joe? - no. - be honest. it's all right. just fucking say it. no, i... i just want to be here. why? i don't know. if you leave tonight, you'll never see me or marcel ever again in your life. you understand? jerome: is this goodbye? - - is that what you're saying? marcel, get up. - stop it. - is that what you want? yeah, so you could see him. look at him, joe. let's face it, joe, you're not a mother. let's wake him up. marcel, baby boy. say bye, mom. - please, put him... - is this what you want? you see? you see, he wants you. come. it's christmas. it's fucking christmas. what is this? today it's madame who must wait. madame, i'm very sorry, but i have to have a few words with fido first. your behavior is really upsetting me today. i really ought to send you home. happy christmas, fido. - i want your cock. - what did you say? i want your cock. no, you don't. no, you don't. what's the matter with you today? on account of the holidays and your behavior today, i'm going to give you the original roman maximum of 40 lashes. are you ready, fido? i'm ready. one. two. three. four. five. six. joe: i'd seen through k's knot technique, so i was able to loosen my position a bit to move my pelvis and thereby stimulate my clitoris against the cover of the book. forty. and when you came home, jerome and the child were gone? i haven't seen marcel since. this sentimentality... i hate it. - why? - because it's a lie. are you sure? jerome understood that he couldn't prioritize his life according to a child either, so he put him in a foster home. my only contact to the boy is the thousand pounds i put in his account every month. anonymously. seligman: as a penance. every time i leave, i have this feeling that when i return, you'll be gone. and all i can hear is the cat flap, - swinging back and forth. - joe: thank you. i didn't know you had a cat flap. i used to have a cat, so i have a cat flap in the door to the stairwell. but how did it get outside? i never thought of that. i suppose through the basement. the thing is... every time someone opens the door to the street, the cat flap squeaks. there's a lot of drafts in the house. it hasn't squeaked yet. no, there's not many people coming and going. that's a bit creepy. no, i like it. it's... it's peaceful. after all this sadness, may i ask what happened to the silent duck? oh, shit. the silent duck. i'd forgotten all about it. joe: one night k had been in what was for him an unusually good mood. i don't know what caused it, but he didn't hit hard, and he joked that he would introduce me to the concept of the silent duck. seligman: one hardly dare imagine the quacking duck. well, deep down, little k seems to have been a jolly man with versatile talents. but he got that bit about roman punishment and the 40 lashes wrong. because it's true that the highest punishment was 40 lashes, but it had to be delivered in series of three. that's why jesus only got 39 lashes because three goes into 39 but not into 40. well, i don't know about k being jolly. his position as a sadist wasn't perhaps as enviable as it might first appear. superficially, the sadist acts as the decider. but i once had a conversation with a prostitute, who had tried all the variations in her field. she wasn't surprised by anything. and she admitted to have only one prejudice: masochists. masochists, for her, were the most demanding and the most ungrateful. first, she were to deduce their desire by reading their thoughts, then perform without any alteration from the norm, and after which, unlike other clients and the most honorable sadists, for example, you never received any thanks, let alone gifts or flowers. i never went in that direction again, neither back to k or masochism. but i took the orgasm with me. you yet have to show me one single example of maliciousness. but that's all i'm doing! it's as if you want to misunderstand me. you keep inventing complicated and false excuses for my despicable and selfish actions. joe: during the time when our relationship was going downhill, jerome really tried his best. i bought you something. - joe: you bought me something? - i'm sure you'll love it. - wow, it's a ring. - yeah. it's beautiful. joe: it was impossible for me to work out jerome's income. sometimes he had lots of money and other times none, which i later thought perhaps meant that his work was not entirely above board. but this time he'd really gone all out. - that must've been so expensive. - well, it wasn't cheap. - best craftsmanship. - hmm. i'll guarantee you that. let's play a game, then. - jerome: a game? - mm-hmm. get up. okay. - it's called ""cinderella"". - i don't know it. - you will. - okay. - right. - no, you don't touch it. - okay. - you just look at it. okay? are you ready? - yes. - steady. steady. - go. - fuck! joe! come on, cinderella. - oh, fuck. - come on, come on. joe! for fuck's sake. - move! - cinderella, cinderella! fuck! are you mad, joe? are you fucking mad? fuck! fuck. PS7,000, joe! did he find it? oh yes, and returned it and got all his money back. so can you call this game anything other than malicious? let me chew on that for a while. so it wasn't the diamond that you're wearing around your neck? no. but that was a gift, too. but i have to be honest and say i can't remember the person who gave it to me. i've always been in... in the theoretical way, of course, interested in diamonds and their cuts. the word ""brilliant"" refers to the cut. diamond is the stone. if we use the word ""divine"" in connection with the golden section and fibonacci, the brilliant cut is nothing less. it's a frighteningly refined cut. fifty-seven facets. the theory is that the light enters through the top plane, which is called the table or in some languages the mirror, and then inside the diamond is refracted in all the facets and thrown out the same way, creating a absolutely unique light effect. so, it's called a mirror. i didn't know that. you have a mirror, too. yeah. it's like a thought, isn't it?  joe: some years later, the bodily abuse began to have an effect. first, rare bleedings from my clitoris, but then they became more and more frequent. woman: come in. but i really need my salary. i know. and i'd like to help you. have you heard any of the rumors about yourself? they say you see men every evening and spend all night with them. they say you can't be trusted, all of them. why do they say that? i suppose they're afraid that i... i can't keep away from their men. right. and can you? no. i've spoken with a psychologist. he says you're addicted, but that it's not the kind of addiction that can't be treated. they have some groups. i know about these kinds of groups. i don't have anything to say to a psychologist. i'm not suggesting therapy. i'm demanding it. even if you leave us, it'll be the same at your next job and the one after that. why didn't you want to speak with a psychologist? it's an old story. i just don't like them. well, if you insist that i try to understand, then you have to tell me that story as well. the old story. - - okay. okay. it's not that old after all. it was about a year after i'd lost marcel and jerome. doctor: okay. joe: i'd been careless with my birth control pills before, and now i just didn't use them. seligman: didn't the whole experience with marcel convince you that there was no room for children in your life? joe: that's right. joe: i know it sounds incomprehensible, but actually, it was because of my crippling fear of becoming pregnant that i didn't take the pills. it's probably impossible to understand. no, it makes sense to me. you were so afraid of getting pregnant that you repressed the possibility of it. you couldn't even handle seeing the box of pills. doctor: okay. would you turn it down? if you look at the screen you can see your child, but i can't tell you the gender yet. i don't give a shit about the gender. i want it removed. okay. uh, you're in week eleven. so legally, there are no barriers for an abortion. yes, i know that. just remove it. well, we have some procedures to follow. there's nothing more to talk about. i can have it removed. i want it removed. it is a very big decision, best not made in haste. didn't you understand what i just said? okay, there's an informative consultation with our psychologist before you can have the procedure. you didn't really fill out the form. maybe you didn't have time, uh, so i will need to ask a few more questions. what's the most important thing in your life right now? it could be many things, your family, your friends, your... the most important thing for me right now is to get an abortion. yes. well, that's what we're going to resolve together. i need some information. do you love the father? that's none of your business. well, it is my business because i'm here to form an impression of your circumstances. that's my job. okay, so what would you most like me to answer about the father in order to get the fucking abortion? that i love him, or that i don't love him? or that i... i don't know him because i fuck tons of men? i, uh, see that you were emotional during the doctor's examination. i think you're emotional. please, listen. this is what we call an informative consultation. what is it i need to be informed of? that you can't stuff the kid back inside? i already know that. i just need to be certain that you're completely sure about your choice, and my professional opinion based on your behavior is that clearly you're not. i've never been more sure in my life. i want that fetus out right now. and as a professional, i cannot defend recommending an abortion based on this conversation. i've already had a kid! i know what i want! fuck you. joe: there were, of course, many ways to do it. but i had chosen to follow the common medical procedure i had learnt while studying medicine, as it was of great importance for me to get the fetus out straight away rather than wait for it to be expelled a couple of days later. clearly, the most painful part would be the gradual opening of the cervix, which otherwise was always done under anesthesia. say something, pierrot. what do you mean? well, you always have so many clever things to say. well, i... i feel bad for you that you had to cause yourself so much pain. but the... the abortion is completely understandable. you simply thought the child wouldn't have a life worth living, so... yeah, but the abortion in itself. - abortion is not murder. - oh, come on. don't fall back on false cliches just for my sake. i ask again, what about the abortion? i have no comment. i'm a big proponent for abortion rights, but this is 100% female territory. i don't believe a man can ever comprehend the situation or the pain. and when it comes to the method, i think the less said, the better. those are two very interesting points of view. first, you say that as a man, you can't understand a woman's feelings with regard to abortion. well, that's a bit like saying that i couldn't understand the victims of earthquakes because they were chinese. i thought we agreed that empathy was the foundation of all humanism. but i can see that it's very convenient for men to leave all that abortion stuff to women. that way they don't have to deal with the guilt and all of the small stuff. but your other remark provokes me even more. you think my method is not worth discussing? what enjoyment would i, or let alone a young pregnant girl, have from hearing all the lurid details about how a fetus is removed in a clinic or any other way? well, then, we're back at the discussion about eating something that was once alive. do you really think abortion is so repugnant if you believe that we should know how animals are slaughtered in order to eat them? well, that's a fact we have to live with, even if we try to repress it. just as we do with abortion. well, you sound like a pro-lifer from texas. i don't think so. first of all, i'm just as much a pro-choice as you are. but on principle, i believe that taboos are damaging for human beings. that's a relatively easy stance for you to take. one that can be misconstrued as a... as an argument against pregnancy termination. i don't want to belittle anything, but i can't see your abortion as anything but a... luxury problem. a luxury problem? the really serious, serious abortions, the ones that save lives, far from our social spheres, you can't endanger them just because you provocatively insist on showing the gory details. consider all the millions of repressed women, the victims of rape and incest, hunger. all those who, maybe thanks to an abortion, have regained a new life, maybe saved a child from starving to death. you can't harm them just because of some principle of openness. luckily, i was able to get the head of the fetus out on the first try, but it rarely goes like that. in the 12th week, the diameter of the head is a little more than 1.2 centimeters. therefore, a very impressive instrument has been developed by the medical community. the nutcracker is an instrument that we use to get the fetus out of the uterus completely. we enter it into and through the dilated cervical channel and position it around the head of the fetus, and you crack it like a nut, and then you pull out the fetus, and there you have it. that is the so-called nutcracker. this is not something i need to know. oh, i hope you're not going to be an opponent of abortion based on that. no, but you have to think of the outrage this knowledge would create in society. so, you're saying that people in general are too stupid to make decisions on an informed basis. and that coming from a man who only an hour ago sermonized about his belief in human qualities. no, you... you're simplifying things. you can't look at it like that. it's funny to see you so emotional suddenly. looking back, it rankles me a bit that i didn't just show up all calm and collected at the appointment with the psychologist and have my abortion under full anesthesia. the fact is that when you're completely under, the fetus doesn't feel anything either, whereas my action, of course, caused pain, depending on how much consciousness you want to ascribe to a fetus about 12 weeks old. i'm a bit nervous about bringing that subject up, as most of the abortions in the world, due to lack of resources, occur just under local anesthesia or none. well, you're a careful man. whether we talk about abortion or not, you can't escape death, and my fetus could have turned out to be a fine human being, but one that would also eventually die. what haunts me is the ironic detail that my father and i were snail-gatherers. we had the deepest compassion, not to say sentimentality, about the smallest living things on the planet which we demonstrated by saving snails, often, by the way, the same size as my fetus, from certain death on the path. we did that only when the other one wasn't watching, as it was a bit embarrassing. father: are you picking up snails? no. are you sure you weren't picking up snails? - yeah. - you're sure? - yeah. - - shall we drop the subject? - yes, please. are you sure you don't want a little tour of the technical details of removal of organs for organ donations? no, thank you. i'm fine. where were we? i think something about your boss sending you to see a psychologist. yes, that's right. - my name is joe. - group: hi, joe. - and i'm a nymphomaniac. - therapist: sex addict. my name is joe, and i'm a nymphomaniac. we say sex addict. here, everyone's the same. renee, last time you told us you had a plan. how did it go? i thought of trying something new, as nothing had helped. i thought if i overdosed... in other words, if i did the exact opposite of what we are trying to do here, then i could get well. you mean function normally. i had prepared the whole thing very carefully. sent my husband away for the weekend and had the children taken care of. it was to happen on the saturday. i had... i had collected phone numbers for a whole month, and then back in the coal. they fucked me for three hours. therapist: and how did you feel about that? well, i never feel good afterwards. i feel ashamed. therapist: but in relation to... to your addiction, do you feel relieved like you thought you would? no. what should i do? i'm ready to do what's necessary. sex addiction is very different from, say, abuse of drugs or alcohol because you don't actually need either of those things. these addictions can be completely removed by removing the drug or the alcohol, not that that's easy. but the difference with sex addiction is that everyone has a sexuality that's an integral part of their personality. if one could imagine exterminating sexuality, then you'd be left with a severely reduced person because... because sexuality also includes tenderness, contact, solidarity with others, which would be hard to imagine anyone living without on some level. what you're saying is that no one can remove their sexuality, even though it's destroying everything for them. i wouldn't say no one, but let's say, at most, one in a million manage to live a life without sexuality. but you can't be basing your therapy on that one in a million. no. the first and most important step is to remove incentive and to reduce exposure. you have to ask yourself what kind of incentives you have and then make it difficult for yourself to come into contact with them. basically, anything that makes you think about sex. stop it. joe has something she'd like to share. - my name is joe. - group: hi, joe. and i'm a sex addict, but i haven't had sex for three weeks and five days. therapist: tell us how you did it, joe. - you brought notes? - yes. dear everyone, don't think it's been easy, but i understand now that we are all alike. - therapist: are you okay, joe? - yes, yes. therapist: would you like a glass of water? thank you. would you rather share another time? no, i'd like to speak. dear everyone, don't think it's been easy, but i understand now that we're not and never will be alike. i'm not like you, who fucks to be validated and might just as well give up putting cocks inside you. you already got your bloody kick a long time ago when it turned out that someone was even bothered to fuck you. and i'm not like you. eat yourself to death if you want. i have no pity for you. all you want is to be filled up, and whether it's by a man or by tons of disgusting slop makes no difference, because it's all just a pathetic attempt at filling out your own resounding emptiness and hiding your ridiculous egocentric self-loathing. and i'm definitely not like you. that empathy you claim is a lie because all you are is society's morality police, whose duty is to erase my obscenity from the surface of the earth, so that the bourgeoisie won't feel sick. i'm not like you. i am a nymphomaniac, and i love myself for being one, but above all, i love my cunt and my filthy, dirty lust. what just happened? i didn't get that, with the car that burned. no, i'm sorry. i was just in too much of a hurry to get to the last chapter. it's dawning. how can you tell? oh, it's... it's just a slight coloring. i know because i've stood here so often at this time. you could say i've developed an ability to see dawn before everyone else. then you understand what i mean when i say that twilight suddenly appeared at this point in my story. i understood that society had no room for me, and i had no room for society and never had. it would've been much, much easier to have realized that earlier on, but suddenly, my senses unfolded dramatically. to go from the respectable daylight side of society to the shady, nocturnal side was like changing sides in a war. you put your old army behind you, and suddenly, the next second, you're swallowed by the new one. there's no in between. i'm sure it was quite natural for you to furnish your room as a monk's cell, but as an inspiration for this story, chapter headings hasn't been easy. there's simply nothing left for me to use. well, i'm sorry about that. but if i may, i can give you a tip. yes, please. you know, i occupy myself mostly with texts, but sometimes the text can seem so... so empty, so unfathomably empty. it could be the best text by the most famous author. the solution might be to change your point of view. i don't get that. things hide when they become familiar. but if you look at them from another angle, they might take on a new meaning. you're right. before this was just the stain from the tea i threw. can you see what it could be? a revolver! no, a revolver has a drum that revolves. it's a pistol. can you see what kind it could be? no, i don't remember anything like that from my literature. oh, but it's something i can remember from mine. - ian fleming. - not familiar. if you haven't read that, you haven't read anything at all. this could be, with a little imagination, a walther ppk automatic, the same gun that was issued to bond, after his preferred pistol, the beretta, had jammed. is that something you can use? oh, yes, it is. # (""burning down the house"" plays) # joe: whether i left society or it left me, i cannot say. i suppose you could make an argument for both sides. i was on my way to the shady side of the debt collecting business, which, among other things, involves stuff like burning people's cars. i had for a long time known about this man, l. hi, my name is joe. i know that. come in. i'm looking for a job. i've been working in an office, and i was never really good at it. i can understand that. i mean, what's the point? i've thought of you now and then and wondered when you'd show up. my lifestyle is relatively expensive, and i need a fair amount of free time for a sideline. of course. i already know that. i believe i possess some qualifications and that i'm rather unscrupulous. i know all about your qualifications and they're excellent. and you have already proven you are unscrupulous by coming here. i would suggest that you start your own little business with my help. i understand you possess a great deal of insight about a rather broad spectrum of men. this could be, or should be, capitalized on. what should i do? i facilitate certain assignments for my humble firm as part of a debt collection business. in other words, i need subcontractors who can put moderate pressure on individuals, with whom my clients rightly or wrongly have a bone to pick. - understand? - extortion. no. no, no, no, no. i always prefer the term ""debt collection."" - yeah. - i refrain from judging whether my clients' wishes are legitimate or otherwise, a point of view i strongly recommend you follow. i'm still unsure of what it is i should do. well, you'll need two thugs, and i can think of two good ones. they both have a lot of experience and can show you the ropes. that's interesting. it's not at all interesting. most interesting thing about it was how easily i dedicated myself to crime. joe: my main qualification, of course, was my considerable experience with men and sex. but even my more specialized skills came in handy. no, now this is not how it goes. you have to wait until you're hit. joe: the two helpers that l had recommended were okay, but they were predisposed to a rather repetitive technique, which consisted of creating as much havoc as possible with a pair of iron bars. destroying your things doesn't seem to have much effect on you. joe, : the only thing worth mentioning from my first years as a collector was the story of an unusually sober-minded, and for that reason vulnerable, man. the dirt i threatened to go public with was normally within my core competence: sex. but for once, here was a man i was unable to read sexually, so i became persistent. tie him to the chair. don't hurt him. i can't find a stain on you, but my experience tells me that no man is spotless. luckily, you're equipped with a very reliable truth detector. i'm going to tell you a few stories. all you have to do is listen. you're in a bar watching a couple... joe: i now meticulously went through the catalogue of sexual deviations in fictional form. stories about sado-masochism, fetishism, homosexuality, you name it. but he didn't react. and i'd almost given up when i said... on your way home, you walk through the park. and something makes you stop. you hear something. yes, that's it. you can hear the children in the playground. you sit on a bench nearby and watch them play. there's a little boy in shorts. he's playing in the sandpit. he looks at you with his blue eyes. he smiles at you. i think he comes to you. he sits on your lap and looks up at your face. he says he'd like to come home with you. at home, you can't fight the idea of being naked together. he crawls all over you. you get an erection. won't you please stop? he lies on his stomach. you pull down his pants. man: i'll pay! you did what? i gave him a blowjob. - why? that pig! - i took pity on him. seligman: pity? yes. i had just destroyed his life. nobody knew his secret, most probably not even himself. he sat there with the shame. i suppose i sucked him off as a kind of apology. that's unbelievable. no, listen to me. this is a man who'd succeeded in repressing his own desire, who had never before given into it, right up until i forced it out. he had lived a life full of denial and had never hurt a soul. i think that's laudable. no matter how much i try, i can't find anything laudable in pedophilia. that's because you think about the perhaps five percent who actually hurt children. the remaining 95 percent never live out their fantasies. think about their suffering. sexuality is the strongest force in human beings. to be born with a forbidden sexuality must be agonizing. the pedophile who manages to get through life with the shame of his desire while never acting on it, deserves a bloody medal. the writer thomas mann said somewhere that a temptation resisted is not a sin but a test of virtue. wasn't there something about that writer and boys? yeah, so they say. i suppose he dealt with it by writing them out. and he got a medal, a nobel prize. joe: but there was another reason for my sympathy, which you find so mysterious. i saw a man who was carrying the same cross as myself. loneliness. we were both sexual outcasts. joe: in any case, some years passed, during which my business grew, enabling me to step up my anonymous deposits to marcel. your business is doing great. you complete all the jobs i give you to perfection. and i hear only words of praise from your other clients, but... - but what? - we aren't getting any younger. no, that's for sure. i think you're getting to that age where you have to start thinking about a successor. oh, i don't need a fucking successor. listen. a person should take their crime seriously. you need someone to be your right hand, someone to help you. a crown princess. the normal process is to find out what colleagues are in prison, or are drug addicts, and thereby unable to fulfill their roles as parents. then, you find out where their kids play football, and you get involved. you cheer them on for a couple of years, no matter how bad they are. actually, the worse, the better. that way, gradually, you take on the role of the parent until, in the end, you have a loyal helper that will walk through fire for you. even do time for you. it sounds like a kind of an entrapment you're suggesting. - an unsavory entrapment. - call it what you want, but if you believe at all in the effects of good parenting, that kid will have much greater opportunities with you as a mentor than without. and since i like you, i've been looking around for a suitable subject. she's 15 years old from a family of hardened criminals, and she's been through a lot. last couple of years she's been institutionalized. her father's in prison and her mother died of an overdose. she's a smart girl. and although she doesn't play football, she does play basketball very badly. she's chosen a team sport because she's lonely. i saved the best part for last. her right ear is slightly deformed, which she is very ashamed of, and of course, this serves to isolate her even more. it makes her an easy target for even the slightest bit of attention or sign of empathy from you. joe: despite my protests, the clever l somehow talked me into actually having a look at p. the longer i watched the poor girl with the deformed ear, the more repulsive i found the whole plan. but as if l had foreseen this, the meeting with p filled me with pity and emotion. and without wanting to, i found myself, weekend after weekend, at her games supporting the poor player. - thanks for cheering me on. - you're welcome. you played really well today. - no, i didn't. - you did. you really improved yourself lately. sixteen years. congratulations. - thank you. - joe: you're welcome. joe: i was proud to introduce p to my father's passion and his world. father: it's actually... the souls of the trees that we see in the winter. i think they look like human souls. yeah, you're right. they do look like human souls. twisted souls, regular souls, crazy souls, all depending on the kind of lives human beings lead. then that must be miss williamson from number 21. that's not a very nice thing to say about miss williamson. but she's always angry. she has a monster in her belly. well, she does have an ulcer in her belly that i've been treating for the last 15 years. joe: and sure enough, one of the following days my dad dragged me into the woods again. i found my tree. my soul tree. and no, it's not that one, okay, 'cause then i would be dead. this is my tree. - young joe: it's not an ash tree. - father: no, it's an oak tree. young joe: it has two trunks. yeah, isn't it great? it shows itself to both sides, the lake and the forest. but, dad, how does a tree get two trunks? the most common reason is that the top broke when it was very young. that means that you've been broken once. have you, dad? it seems that it can be rather revealing... to find your soul tree. my father found his soul tree, but i've never found mine. ""you will know it when you see it,"" is what he said. kitchen and dining room. and in here... joe: when p reached the age of maturity and i became her personal adviser, i asked her to move in with me. let me see you with your hair up. you're so pretty. joe: all this time all my sexual activity had stopped. my groin was one big sore from my abuse that wouldn't heal, and made even masturbation impossible. i experienced definite abstinence symptoms... fever and cramps. joe, what's going on? - careful. - we need to clear this up. i just get this sometimes. it's okay. it's okay. do you want to go back to bed? yeah. yeah, yeah. i love you, joe. i love you, too. i don't mean it in that way. come on, it's late. you should go back to bed. good night. seligman: perhaps she really loved you. she was so very young. maybe she, too, discovered her cunt at the age of two. maybe earlier. i couldn't accept it. perhaps because you really wanted it to be true. perhaps i hoped it. it's very touching, all this about p. then you've probably misunderstood the whole thing. shall we get the story over and done with? don't. i wanna see you. - don't. - why? - please, don't. - why not? no. no, i have a wound. - i have a wound. - it doesn't matter. - no, you don't understand. - i have that thing with my ear. i'm so ashamed. do you like me? you're so beautiful. there's one thing i don't understand. did she know what you did for a living? p was very discreet and a girl of few words. oddly, although i worked strange hours, she never asked about my work. but one day she had a question. joe. why did you start coming to my basketball matches? it wasn't a coincidence, was it? no, it wasn't a coincidence. i didn't tell you because i... i thought you'd be upset... and that you'd get angry at me. i won't get angry. what i do... my job isn't a normal job. it's not legal. no one in my family does anything legal. a man that's helped me in my business suggested that i watched you. the plan was that i... i should look at you to see whether one day i could use you in my work. i should make friends with you because i knew you didn't have a mother or a father. what's wrong with that? don't you see how evil that plan was? - i felt terrible. - you shouldn't have. why not? because if you hadn't... we'd never have met. i'd like to go with you to work next time. no. will you think about it? - no. - yes. she didn't take no for an answer. no, of course not. how do you keep a wave upon the sand? and in the throes of love, i was weak and no match for her. with the risk of being too clever for myself, social inheritance is an irrefutable fact. if anyone knew about the laws of the street, it must've been p. you're more right than you know. - let's shoot the fucker. - man: no, no! stop! stop! we don't use firearms. - i'd like to have the gun. - the others have weapons, too. well, i didn't know that, but in any case, you're not to have one. but guns aren't dangerous. it depends on how you use them. yes, exactly. i wasn't going to shoot him. we wouldn't have gotten any money out of him that way. can i have the gun? thank you. you're evil. joe: and now i'm afraid one of those coincidences you have such a hard time with occurred with a very special person. it was p's job to take us to the debtors, so until i saw the name on the door, i had no idea whose house we were at. this is acer siccharium. - saccharinum. - saccharinum, yeah, that. i said that. are you sure this is the right place? p: yeah. i was thinking maybe it's time for you to do this one on your own. yeah? - thank you, joe. - i don't want anything destroyed, and i don't want anybody hurt. okay? you just show yourself and offer him a reasonable payment plan. if you say so, of course that's how i'll do it. joe: whether the feeling when i saw jerome again was love, i couldn't say. but it was a feeling... and far stronger than i liked. joe: i was actually walking home through the alley here. your two neighborhoods are totally different, but still so close together that the shortest route from jerome's house towards the center was through the alley. hello! - how did it go? - brilliant. yeah, really well. i made a reasonable payment plan like you told me to. - how did he look? - scared. how old did he look? i don't know. ancient? joe: jerome was to pay off his debt in six payments. every time p went to jerome to collect, i'd pace around restlessly until she was back home again. i even had to find my mother's sad old solitaire cards in order to make the hours pass. each night i was less reassured by her coming home than the night before. the question of whether jealousy is the fear of sharing or the fear of losing was of little interest to me. but yes, it was a fact that this unworthy feeling i had managed to suppress for so long was creeping up on me. the evening she was to collect the final payment, she didn't kiss me. i took it to be forgetfulness, but the hours passed, and she didn't return. every time i saw car lights, i thought it was p being driven home. joe: so the next morning i took a trip to the round hills just outside of town that i visited with my school class when i was 12, to say a symbolic goodbye. i had decided to flee. i couldn't stay in this town with her and him. i had cowardly made a plan to escape and head south. like from some ice age i didn't have the guts to turn around and face. but the goodbye was sad and strangely unfulfilling. and something called me on to seek further up the mountain. i understand dictators who commit murder. what was hitler, when it all boils down, other than a man to whom society gave free reins? well, that was just what we were missing. you understand racists, you have a soft spot for pedophiles, and, of course, now at the finishing line, you have to sympathize with the greatest mass murderers of history. what i mean is... it's said to be difficult to take someone's life. i would've said that it's more difficult not to when, as a dictator or as me, you've nothing to lose. for a human being, killing is the most natural thing in the world. we're created for it. wonderful. man: no, get off! fireman's grip. fill all my holes, please. i still don't know why the gun didn't work. i did check to make sure that there were bullets in the magazine. it simply malfunctioned. just like bond's beretta. i think i know enough to say that even if you had rounds in the magazine of the walther ppk, if you'd taken off the safety, you cannot shoot until you've racked the gun. you pull and release the sliding mechanism. and p hadn't done it because as she said, she had no intention of shooting the man. i don't know about bond, but i assume it has to be apparent from his books and his films that you have to rack an automatic pistol. of course, you're right. i've seen it in films a thousand times. it's morning. - the snow is gone. - so the sun must be up? yes, there is sun. how can you see it? this alley's located so that you never get direct sunlight here, but i can see a small reflection on the building on the other side. i've never managed to figure out where it comes from. it must be some interplay between windows and towers and high buildings. it's not much, but it's the sun you get here at my place. it's beautiful. seligman: in the beginning, you said that your only sin was that you asked more of the sunset. meaning, i suppose, that you wanted more from life than was good for you. you were a human being demanding your right, and more than that, you were a woman demanding her right. does that pardon everything? do you think if two men were to walk down a train looking for women, do you think anybody would have raised an eyebrow, or if a man had led the life you had? and the story about mrs. h. would've been extremely banal if you'd been a man. and your conquest would have been a woman. when a man leaves his children because of desire, we accept it with a shrug, but you as a woman, you had to take on a guilt, a burden of guilt that could never be alleviated. your abortion was legal, but more than anything else, it was a punishment you inflicted upon yourself. and all in all, all the blame and guilt that piled up over the years became too much for you, and you reacted aggressively, almost like a man, i have to say, and you fought back. you fought back against the gender that had been oppressing and mutilating and killing you and billions of women in the name of religion or ethics, or god knows what. but i wanted to kill a human being. seligman: but you didn't. joe: because of a chance event. seligman: you call it a chance event, i call it subconscious resistance. on the surface you wanted to kill, but deep down, you celebrated human worth in a veil of forgetfulness draped itself over your knowledge of how to rack a gun. although all this sounds frighteningly close - to the cliches of our times... - and i'm predisposed to knock holes in your arguments... i'm too tired. well, that's good. why don't you lay down? yes. let me just say that telling my story as you insisted, or permitted, has put me at ease. at this moment, my addiction is very clear to me. and i've come to a decision. even though only one in a million, as my dubious therapist said, succeed in mentally, bodily, and in her heart ridding herself of her sexuality... this is now my goal. but is that a life worth living? it's the only way i can live it. i will stand up against all odds... just like a deformed tree on a hill. i will muster all of my stubbornness... my strength... my masculine aggression. but most of all i want to say thanks to my new and maybe first friend. thank you, seligman... who perhaps is happy when all is said and done. i'm happy at any rate that the shot didn't go off and made me a murderer. if i may, i'd like to sleep now. i'll make sure you won't be disturbed. and when you wake up, maybe we could discuss your future if you'd like. in your new life, would you consider seeking out your son? it's possible. good night, joe. good night, seligman. no! seligman: but you, you fucked thousands of men.   "
Von Trier,Nymphomaniac,"  man: hello? you've had an accident. you need an ambulance. i'll call for one. i'll be right back. - lie still here. - no. no. man: no what? i don't need an ambulance. man: i can clearly see you do. i'll call for one. in that case, i'll be up and gone before you have time to come back. man: that will hurt. that's possible. but it doesn't matter to me. man: i assume you don't want me to call the police either. yes, that's exactly right. man: is there anything you want? i'd like a cup of tea with some milk. man: well... you have to come with me. i don't serve tea in the street. can you walk? woman: yeah. i've even bought a cake. here's a pajama. thank you. i've made up the bed for you. with clean sheets. - man: sorry. - that's okay. man: there. - i'll wash your clothes. - not my coat. it smells rather badly. it's my coat. the smell won't come off anyway. it's your coat. - man: do you take sugar? - woman: no, thank you. there you go. thank you. so what happened? were you robbed? it's my own fault. i'm just a bad human being. i've never met a bad human being. well, you have now. do you want to talk about it? you wouldn't understand. well, try me. but i wouldn't know where to start. why is that ridiculous fishhook hanging there? man: that's a fly. i caught a fish with it once, a rather big one. strangely enough. fly fishing is about tying feathers and other things to a hook so it resembles something the fish likes to eat. and then because the fly is very light, you have to have a line that is heavy. it creates the velocity when you cast. - you fish a lot? - well, some. but i don't catch much. the locals catch a lot more. when i was young, i... i had a book i... i worshipped. man: it was an old book by izaak walton called ""the complete angler."" it was like a romantic nature bible to me. maybe i know where to start. but if you're to understand, i'll... i'll have to tell you the whole story. and it'll be long. long is good. and moral, i'm afraid.  woman: to begin with the bait, i discovered my cunt as a two-year-old. man: ""cunt"" is a very strong word. woman: let's call it ""pandora's box"" then. man: um... no, no, no. ""cunt"" is better. woman: so, i was a nymphomaniac. man: wait a moment, no. nobody can be a nymphomaniac when they're only two years old. i don't think even the strictest god would see anything else than a child's normal behavior. what about fetuses? it's common knowledge that fetuses often touch their genital organs. can a fetus somehow be sinful? why not? not according to any religion i know, unless it's an original sin. ancestral. or perhaps according to a religion that doesn't exist yet. according to a god that hasn't yet manifested himself. but then you can imagine anything. woman: at an early age, i was mechanically inclined. kinetic energy, for example, has always fascinated me. and my friend, let's call her ""b,"" always came up with the ideas. playing frogs was one of b's classics. woman: joe, are you all right? joe: just a moment. woman: are you done? for christ's sakes, leave them alone. joe: i loved my father very much. he was a doctor. my mother's name was katherine. my father called her kay. i suppose she was what you'd call ""a cold bitch."" she always had her back turned when she played solitaire. i hated solitaire. joe: when we had p.e., i'd climb up into the ropes and hang there for ages with the rope between my legs. ""the sensation"" we called it. i remember very distinctly this word, ""sensation."" perhaps the only difference between me and other people was that i've always demanded more from the sunset. more spectacular colors when the sun hit the horizon. that's perhaps my only sin. why are you insisting that children are sinful? not children. me. i don't see sin anywhere. but then i'm not religious. well, that's because you don't know the rest of the story. and by the way, i'm not religious either. why would you take the most unsympathetic aspect of religion such as the concept of sin... and let it survive beyond religion? i don't understand this self-hatred. well, that's what i said. - you wouldn't understand. - no, i'm... i'm sorry, i'll shut up. please continue. nervus... pudendus. nervus dorsalis clitoridis. when the ash tree was created, it made all the other trees in the forest jealous. it was the most beautiful tree. you couldn't say anything bad about it. it was the world tree in norse mythology. remember, odin... he hung from the ash tree, yggdrasil, for nine days in order to gain insight. the ash tree had the strongest wood. then in the winter... when the ash tree lost all of its leaves... all the trees noticed its black buds, and started laughing. ""oh, look. the ash tree has had its fingers in the ashes."" see? you can always tell the ash tree in winter by the black buds. now... now this is a lime tree leaf. - remember? - i forgot about the lime tree. i've told you 100 times. joe: my dad loved telling me about the trees, and their leaves, and considered it part of a good education. he especially loved the childish educational stories he told to help me remember what i had learned. i knew how much he loved telling those stories. sometimes i pretended i'd forgotten them. father: originally, the lime tree's leaves were round. a fox had her den beneath its roots where she had four cubs. one day, she went out looking for food for them. there was a hunt in the forest. she was shot. wounded, she crawled back to the den where she and the four cubs died. this made the lime tree so sad. and from then on, the lime tree decided to have... heart-shaped leaves. oh, yes, that's right. heart-shaped. am i boring you? man: no, no. i'm just looking forward to how you'll get fishing weaved into your tale. you could start with the fly on the wall there. it's called a nymph. it will tie in elegantly with your discussion about nymphomania. a nymph is an early stage in the life of an insect. joe: as a quite young nymph, it was imperative for me to get rid of my virginity. hopla. i kind of knew this boy, j, who had a moped. so in my eyes he was rather sophisticated. i was 15, and perhaps my girlish, romantic expectations were a bit high. joe: but he had good, strong hands. i liked his hands. hello? - hi. - hi. if i asked you to take my virginity would that be a problem? no, i don't see a problem. so, um... where shall i go? it's the fucking carburetor. i just can't work it out, you imagine that? - that's not very good. - hmm? - it's not very good. - no, it bloody isn't. ruins the whole idea of having a moped. you should probably take off your knickers, yeah? joe: he shoved his cock inside me and humped me three times. joe: then he turned me over like a sack of potatoes. then he humped me five times in the ass. joe: i never forgot those two humiliating numbers. man: three and five? those are fibonacci numbers. that may be. in any case, it hurt like hell. i swore i'd never sleep with anyone again. but of course that only lasted a short while. and now to get back to your fishing. a couple of years later, i was at my friend b's, and as always, she had a new idea, financed by her younger brother's piggy banks which she regularly emptied. we put on clothes later known as the ""fuck me now"" clothes. the idea was a competition. we were to go on a train trip. b said there was no need for tickets. the one who would fuck the most men when we reached the destination would win the chocolate sweets. man: may i interrupt here? what you were doing when you walked down that corridor. you were reading the river. man: most of the large fish stay sheltered from the current to save energy, and to hide from the prey. where the fish hides in the stream entails a very complicated hierarchy. the topography decides where the most attractive places are, and the biggest fish choose the best positions. what do i do? b: smile and make eye contact. but what if it doesn't work? if you have to talk, remember to ask lots of ""wh"" questions if you want more than a yes or no answer. then it'll just happen on its own. you just take them to the lavatory and you have sex with them. oh. what if it's nasty? then you just think of the bag of chocolate sweeties. what... what time is it? ten. where do you come from? from home. who knows where the lavatory is? well, if you take a right, you will arrive at a lavatory at the end of the car. at the same time it is so cleverly arranged that if you take a left turn you will also arrive at a lavatory since at the end of the next car there is also one. let me show you where the lavatory is. joe: it turned out to be shockingly easy. in no time, b was ahead five to three. and it was exactly right. look them in the eye and smile. but then suddenly, it stopped. that's a very clear parallel to fishing in the stream. as it happens, either none of the fish are feeding, or they all feed at the same time. they go into feeding frenzy. all bite. and then just as suddenly as it started, it stops. it's observable, but it's highly unpredictable. and it has to do with, i don't know, weather, barometric pressure, maybe some fish psychology. if that's possible. anyway, the fish most readily bite at the beginning of a light rain, and i think that's because they feel safe when they swim in the stream. because they can't be seen from above. the water's surface is disturbed. but then it started again. although, a bit more slowly. yeah. i think i know how. because fly fishing can be done in several phases. and if the fish stop biting, you move on to phase two. and in phase two, you not only imitate an insect, but an insect in trouble. you pull... you pull the line. you tug it irregularly, so the fish gets the impression that it's dealing with an injured and easy prey. and then helplessly, let the fly float down the river again. then half-heartedly, make a few jumps forward again. it can be done... it can be done very elegantly. - - hey. sorry. nothing to feel sorry about. i'm just not feeling very well today. what could be so bad? oh, thank you. i can't talk about it right now. can i just sit here for awhile? yeah. sure. man: is it better now? no. - are you all right? - it's betty. i was just told that she's very ill. is betty a close family member? you could say that. she's my dwarf hamster. man: dwarf hamster? you can't be serious. joe: well, what was i to do? and then, i did have a dwarf hamster when i was young. man: that you were very close to? joe: not at all. a bloody nuisance. dwarf hamster? that's not so bad. would have been worse if it were a person. don't say that. i'm extremely fond of my hamster. yes, i think that's a rather cynical thing to say about betty. yes, i made the cage nice and cozy for her when... - when i got her. - i bet she liked that. betty was excited. joe: one of nature's most meaningless creatures. man: you're aware that the choice of a dwarf hamster possibly suggests certain sexual connotations. joe: i can see that now but it was really not a conscious choice. how long does a dwarf hamster actually live? months, years? its life is much too short. would you show me where the lavatory is? i... have to blow my nose. joe: just the same, we were running out of subjects, and b was ahead on points, which led us to s's first-class compartment. conductor: tickets, please. thank you. ladies? tickets. joe: well... i think i might have lost it. conductor: perhaps. drop yours as well, did you? i haven't bought a ticket for your shitty train. it's so bloody slow, we should have been at the end of the track half an hour ago. regardless of delays, you still need a ticket, sweetheart. eight pounds each, please. ooh! i accidentally tore it up. can't expect me to pay for scraps of paper. - have another one. - oh, great idea. oh, that one's disappeared too. i can always just get the police to collect your payment at the next station... let's just take it easy here, shall we? apparently, the young ladies have left without any money. if it's okay with you, i'd like to pay for their tickets. no, sir, it's not. leave your money where it is. we'll let the police deal with these two. we did have sort of an agreement that i was to pay. i just forgot about it. i see. two first-class tickets... for two first-class ladies. enjoy the rest of your journey. tickets, please. now that you've been so nice to us... we'd like to be nice to you, too. s: oh, that's very kind of you, but there's no need. i mean that. you have to split them up into whether they have a goal and a mission or not. that one doesn't. joe: well, i've already lost anyway. i'm willing to give you five extra points... if you can get that one in there. joe: i decided, perhaps a bit desperately, that the only thing standing between me and the bag of chocolate sweets, was an unequivocal provocation of this man. man: excellent. an induced take. when all other attempts fail, a dramatic provocation can get an otherwise completely passive fish to bite. a salmon or a trout, for example, eats itself fat while in salt water, and then basically has no need to eat as it makes its way upstream to the spawning grounds. they're not hungry but they will react instinctively to the right provocation. which would not be a fly, but for instance, a brightly colored wobbler, preferably red, served immediately in front of the fish. the very best is one we call the finnish weapon. the so-called ""rappala."" joe: i don't know if it's comparable, but i decided in any case to find out why he hadn't taken the bait, and to use my psychological abilities, which b, in my opinion, didn't possess to the same degree. joe: you've bought a gift. yes. it's for my wife. - no gifts for the children? - no. we don't have any, actually. well, you seem rather well-to-do. you travel first-class, and you bought us our tickets. why then not buy a decent gift for your wife? i can see it comes from the station. of course i should have... bought her something... something better, but... let's just say i was suddenly in a hurry to get home. why would a man like you with such an orderly life suddenly have to hurry? it has to do with family. my wife and i have decided that we... we miss having children, after all. and that if we are to have children, it has to be now. so my wife called yesterday to say that she... she started ovulating. and all signs point to maximum fertility precisely tonight. you see? that's why i bought her a gift at the station. i had to get a ticket home as quickly as possible. - well, i understand now. - what is it you understand? why you didn't have sex with us. it wasn't because i didn't want to. so you've been saving your sperm. for weeks. i mean, you and your wife are... seem to be at an age where every attempt to become pregnant has to be taken very seriously. right now, my... my sperm quality is at its peak, i'm told. please... i'm begging you, please don't. it's okay. please don't. you've been as horny as hell. but you wouldn't give up your load. please don't. oh, fuck. wow. in your case, it wasn't the taste of a madeleine cake, moistened with lime blossom tea, but the combination of chocolate and sperm. what? that was a piece of culturally blasphemic digression. it's a story about memory. how the combination of two flavors set off a chain of memories. so oral sex became, in the eye of the angler, your... your finnish weapon. joe: is that your only comment? what else... what else do you want me to say? that i behaved reprehensibly. that already my actions exemplify that i'm a... i'm a terrible human being. that's not the way i see it. on the contrary, i saw it as a... a very pleasurable and humorous story. not at all sad, or... or weighed down by sin. like all that talk about pandora's box. i've consciously used and hurt others... for the sake of my own satisfaction. and what i've told you so far only begins to suggest that. but when you told the story, you were cheerful. full of humor. it wasn't as if you embarked on some tragic tale. well, that's the way i am. joe: i've always loved the chills at the start of a fever, knowing only too well that sickness will soon follow. man: the only thing you've done, except giving a few people an experience to remember, is that you... you relieved s from his load in some... some youthful hubris. i read somewhere that if you keep the load too long the sperm will die. or worse, degenerate. maybe thanks to you, mr. s and his wife now have a healthy and well-functioning child. i discovered my power as a woman and used it without any concern for others. that's completely unacceptable. oh, little darling... don't you ""little darling"" me. no. what i wanted to say was that if you have wings, why not fly? allow me to digress. i read a book about sikorski and helicopters where the author stressed the fact that in order to take off, you tilt the helicopter forward. it looks like you're trying to force the helicopter down into the ground, but the effect is the contrary. that the velocity takes the helicopter and sweeps it up in the air. the pilots say the helicopter wants to fly. it's like when you're in a glider plane, and suddenly you're lifted, because of the spontaneous emission of thermals. thermals is when the sun is warming up the field, and it emits a thermal bubble of warm air that rises. these aircraft, they want to fly. it's just a little unpredictable when. you flew on that... on that train. and that surprised you. no more stories. you need to sleep. no, no. this is beginning to amuse me. i don't even know your name. my name is joe. i'm seligman. what a fucking ridiculous name. it's jewish. you said you weren't religious. no, but my great-grandfather was. and my parents gave me the name as a sort of... sentimental association to judaism. why let the sentimental part of religion, as you said, outlive religion itself? you have a point. but we've always been anti-zionists, which is not the same as being anti-semitic, as certain political powers try to convince us. seligman... means ""the happy one."" so, are you happy then? well, i suppose i am. in my own way. even if i'm the kind of person who cut the nails of the right hand first. what does that mean? well, i divide humanity into two groups: the people who cut the nails on the left hand first, and the people who cut the nails of the right hand first. my theory is that the people who cut the nails of the left hand first, they're more light-hearted. they have a tendency to enjoy life more, because they go straight for the easiest task, and... save the difficulties for later. - so what do you do? - always the left hand first. i don't think there's a choice. go for the pleasure first, always. and then when you've done the left hand, only the right hand remains. that's the easiest one left. i never thought of it like that. well, you're never too old. never too old to learn. joe: that's rugelach. seligman: mm-hmm. yeah, it's a jewish cake. - there's that sentimentality again. - oh, but it's more than rugelach. it's rugelach served with a cake fork. a rugelach, in my opinion, is pastry, which there is no excuse for eating with a cake fork. to serve it with a cake fork is irritatingly unmanly, not to say downright feminine. however, it can bring us further with the story. i also knew someone who consumed rugelach every day, almost ritually, with a cake fork. and although we'll be jumping a bit in time, i have to tell you about jerome. as far as i can see, the next chapter doesn't contain as direct an accusation against my person as the rest of the story. but as you've read a great deal, apparently, you know that in a story things have to be good before they can be bad. the chapter will also make a sentimental soul like you happy as it contains observations on the subject of love.  can i tell you something? sure. - yeah. - yeah, sure. it might not be important to you... but it is to me. i've never had an orgasm before. really? you're my first one. you don't know how happy that makes me. i love you. you're my first. well, i have to admit, quite a lot of girls say that. joe: the train trip had increased my appetite, and soon b and i started a club that we called ""the little flock."" mea vulva, mea maxima vulva. joe: b, of course, took the lead as she was the most daring of us. she was raised catholic. i'm sure you're familiar with the practices of the catholic church. all:...mea maxima vulva. mea vulva, mea... seligman: that's interesting. blasphemic, satanic. the music. the interval between ""b"" and ""f."" it's a tritone. the devil's interval. it was banned from music in the middle ages. well, the vacuum cleaner invented it. she took piano lessons. vacuum cleaner? the vacuum cleaner possessed a special talent for floppy cocks. she had some kind of vacuum in her cunt. i was imagining something like that. fourteenth of the eighth. i was at a place called the donkey. the boys were staring, university hangout. i approached the stupidest one of the lot and asked for directions to the underground. he studied literature. i told him i read a lot, and that i really admired people that chose to study subjects in depth. as i said, he was very stupid. told me all about kierkegaard. i nodded, smiled. then he asked if we could go elsewhere. the idiot thought he'd pulled me after five minutes of his bullshit. i told him i was on my period, and i took out his cock and gave him a hand job. ugly, little shriveled cock, with a tight foreskin. when i pulled it back, it sort of collapsed but it worked in the end. university boys are disgusting. and then i jacked him off until he shook in that way they do, you know. just before they come. then i let go of his cock and got up. i left him standing up against the wall with his pants round his ankles looking stunned. now, b's message wasn't exactly representational. she just had to be the tough one. it was directed at the men. it was about fucking, and about having the right to be horny. we masturbated together, that kind of thing. but it was rebellious. we weren't allowed to have boyfriends. no fucking the same guy more than once. you said you were rebellious. what did you rebel against? love. love? we were committed to combat the love-fixated society. joe: i really believed in our little flock. but of course, that was naive of me. over time, even the strongest couldn't stay true to our manifest. b: third of the fifth. my third intercourse this week, - again with alex. - third? haven't we stated that we fuck each guy once? b: yes, but he was rather sweet. joe: sweet? - well, you know, sexy. - well, then, say sexy. he squeezed my earlobes. earlobes? great. what else did he squeeze? i don't think you can understand alex. i don't want to. - our relationship-- - relationship. there you are. the way you're describing it, which should be full of lust, is just a nauseating analysis of his future abilities as a father to your child. you think you know everything about sex. the secret ingredient to sex is love. for me, love was just lust with jealousy added. everything else was total nonsense. for every 100 crimes committed in the name of love, only one is committed in the name of sex. that's quite a statement. well, it all strengthened my wish for a serious education. glasgow. aberdeen. joe: why are you smiling? well, i just pictured how an education would be conveyed in your storytelling. well, that's nothing to smile about. oh, i understand that. so what kind of education did you get? i began studying medicine, like my father. today we are going to perform the procedure that's called an abortion. we open up our cervical channel to enter the uterus, and to get access to the fetus, for which we use the so-called hegal sticks. we enter the vagina tract, and go into the cervical channel. we start with a small sized stick to cause a minimum of damage to the tissue. and then we increase the size of the stick. joe: but it was harder and harder for me to concentrate, so i studied less and less, till finally i dropped out. my dad was very disappointed when i stopped. but it was the only time i saw my mother really smile when she said, ""what did i tell you?"" so instead, i began to look for a job. it turned out it was hard to get a job that paid even halfway decently. i didn't really know how to do anything. so i didn't have high hopes when i applied for a position as an assistant at a printing house. woman: so, could you tell me a little bit more about your background? um... - woman: education-wise. - oh. well, i finished high school, and decided to study medicine. but i didn't finish. i know it sounds a bit pointless coming here. - right. - i just really need a job. and i've tried everywhere. i don't usually give jobs to people just because they need one. what about secretarial skills? do you have any of those? no, i didn't think you needed skills. you didn't think you needed skills for this position - as a secretary? - no. can you open an envelope? yes, i... yes, i think i can open an envelope. well, i'm glad to hear that. i shall discuss this conversation with mr. jerome, my boss. joe: do you think there's a chance? - i doubt it. - oh. well, apparently, having absolutely no experience is absolutely fine for this job. you've got it. does that mean i should start tomorrow? yeah, i suppose it does. - joe: good morning. - woman: right. - - yes? - good morning, sir. - good morning. i just wanted to introduce you to our new junior secretary. joe? i believe you wanted to explain her work duties. - hi. - this is the new junior secretary. liz, can i have another coffee? - yes, of course, sir. - thank you. hi. - jerome. - your first love. i bet you didn't think i'd make something of myself, right? and now, here i sit. the director's chair of m & j morris, ltd. - yeah, it's quite surprising. - surprising? it's a sign from god. you know, i've thought about you often since then. have you thought of me? - well... - what? usually, you know, my uncle sits here. but he's developed a bit of a tummy problem, so he's at the spa, taking long baths, drinking lots of water, poor guy. and no one knows for how long. so now i'm the ""j"" in m & j morris, ltd. how about that? we print cards and envelopes, nonsense like that. it's a bloody complicated business, you know. i don't understand a word of it. come, i'll show you around. yes? - ladies? - woman: yes, sir. oh, look, there you are. good job. every time you do a good job, i say, ""good job, liz."" - thank you, sir. - what's her name? - liz. - good job, liz. - good job, liz. - good job, liz. it stopped. fuck. yes. - well, isn't there an alarm? - which? - isn't there... - alarm, right, yes. - good thinking. - imagine... you look just as great all these years later. oh, no. -  no. - no? no, jerome, this won't work. - which won't work? - this. why not? you're not really my type. that's how it's gonna be? - yes. - all right. fuck's sake. okay. joe: um... give me your hand. we'll do fireman's grip. - you okay? - yeah. why didn't you have sex with him? you must have had sex in a lift before. i'm not quite sure. i've shagged lots of idiots. including worse idiots than him. of course, i... i regretted that it had been him back then. but that's just sentimental drivel. and i'm not sentimental. i suppose he fired you then. no. if he had fired me, then he would have lost. joe: as i didn't recall anyone having defined my work duties, i decided to clean up in order to smooth the waters. liz: good morning, sir. - any calls? - no, sir. - what have you done? - oh. i cleaned up. you cleaned up. - it was quite messy, and-- - liz? - yes, sir? - she cleaned up. i know, i... i didn't know, sir. - i was away from my desk. - are you completely mad? what is the tea and pastry doing here? i thought that's what you wanted for-- you thought? you're not supposed to think. i don't pay you to think, do i? this is a do-over. - a do-over... - right. pick it up. take it outside. and do it again. - - one moment. come in. would now be a good time for some tea and cake? sure, why not? where the fuck's my cake fork? - cake fork? - right. well, i would have got you one, but it just... feels inappropriate. unmanly. feminine. well, on the other hand, you must say that a cake fork is a rather practical tool. it's like a cross between a knife and a fork. the point is that you're supposed to be able to hold the cake dish with one hand and then cut it with the other. and then eat it with the fork. it's not feminine, it's at least bourgeois. it's said that the bolsheviks, during their rampage through russia, to separate the men from the boys, or rather the bourgeoisie from the proletariat, they brought a boy, and before burning down a house they sent him in to make sure they had cake forks. - that's not true. - i don't have the story first-hand. joe: hello. - man: hi. - joe: hi. i was wondering if you could help me. it's suddenly gone very dirty. see, yes? see, you've got your dirty fingers on there. maybe we should wash your hands. yeah, better. mm-hmm. - you must be very talented. - yeah, sure. hmm. you see, here's got a stain. joe: if you'd asked jerome, he would have said that i was the one who'd declared war. many times he'd take me into town just so i could hold his coat. - joe: there. - jerome: where? joe: there, behind the green car. - it's not big enough. - it is, there's plenty of space. i saw it, it's not enough space. i'm telling you, there's plenty of space. no. it's too small a space for such a long car. can i try? - can you try? - i'm a wizard at this. i just tried, it's not enough space, joe. you just saw me do it. it's not enough space, okay? - can i try? - fuck. you want to try? why not? stupid. joe: it was about this time that a dramatic change happened inside of me. i could suddenly see a kind of order in the mess. are you just standing here looking? yeah. i've begun to like his mess. how do you mean? well, these are all things placed by jerome. i mean, by jerome's hands. sounds to me like you would like to be handled by mr. jerome. darling, you're in love with him. it was all very, very wrong. i wanted to be one of jerome's things. i wanted to be picked up and put down, again and again. i wanted to be treated by his hands according to some sophisticated principle that i didn't understand. his strong hands? yes, but now it was no longer just about his hands. it's as if everything about him was different, which, of course, it wasn't and i knew that in my head. and i scolded myself for seeing him in this new light. - love is blind. - no, no, no, it's worse. love distorts things. or even worse... love is something you've never asked for. the erotic was something i asked for, or even demanded of men. but this idiotic love... i felt humiliated by it, and all the dishonesty that follows. the erotic is about saying yes. love appeals to the lowest instincts, wrapped up in lies. how do you say ""yes"" when you mean ""no,"" and vice versa. i'm ashamed of what i became. but it was beyond my control. - you know what you're doing now? - no, what am i doing? you're defending your personality. i thought the point was to reveal it. - thank you. - you're welcome. thank you meaning, ""that's all."" you can go now. goodbye, joe. joe: at this time, i took up walking again. seligman: you walked in the forest? joe: yes, i walked in the forest. the forest of my childhood. i took the same walk again and again. right turn after the gatehouse, and right again by the ash tree, which has the most beautiful leaves in the forest, and further on, past a lady with her poodle, and the old man on the bench. i couldn't free myself of the image of jerome and his careless elegance. and during this time, when i was with other men, i forbade them to touch my body with their hands. and soon, i stopped having sex altogether. i tried to meet him all the time. i found out where he lived, but of course, never dared ring his doorbell. i even started humiliating myself on purpose in order for him to notice me. you broke a taillight. i did. i thought you were such a wizard at parking. so did i. it'll be deducted from your salary. - it's a long car. - joe: i worked for a long time on a letter in which i told him about my feelings for him, but couldn't bring myself to hand it over. - bye. - bye. bye. joe: a month would pass before i had built up enough courage to deliver it. well, i've written him a letter after all. do you think that the letter is a bad idea? no, i think it's the right thing to do. i'm just... i think maybe you should wait until friday. why? he's always in a good mood on fridays. okay. i'm sorry, isn't this... jerome's office? i'm happy to say that this never has been and never will be jerome's office. my nephew has been standing in for me while i've been unwell. what's that? a letter for him? yes. give it to me and i'll make sure he gets it. can't promise when that might be because he's long gone. how the young finance their irrepressible desire for travel is a mystery to me. - so he's gone? - deserted us, yes. raving about a trip around the world, - and married, and all. - married? marriage, yes. flown the coop with my secretary. liz. and your job? well, it turned out that jerome's uncle demanded a bit more knowledge about the business, so... i see. well, as for evidence of you being a bad human being, there wasn't much to go on in this chapter. yes, as i said. at least superficially. - i suppose you were jealous. - no, i wasn't jealous. i didn't know that feeling. it's almost superhuman not to feel jealousy. well, that was the end of love, then? well, maybe not quite as simple. but more about that later, as they say in the novels. and jerome just disappeared? yes. though i'd tried to keep him in my own way, mentally, as i masturbated on the train amongst other people. you masturbated on the train, on the seat? - yes, of course. - and that's possible? easily. you just put your coat in your lap. it can be done silently without expression. the only thing that could give me away and mostly to women, was my open mouth when i came. joe: i did a jigsaw puzzle. seligman: ajigsaw puzzle? joe: i found details in the other passengers that reminded me of jerome. joe: but in the long run, i couldn't hold onto the details of him, no matter how hard i tried. so, you could say that in a way, jerome followed you as a kind of silhouette. yes, but gradually disappearing as a sexual being. maybe that's how it is with memory. you remember silhouettes. the essentials. but that's not necessarily a bad thing. joe: of course there's silhouettes in the winter. the trees are difficult to tell apart. these buds... joe: my father wrestled courageously with his flora and tree type guides. it's actually... the souls of the trees we see in the winter. in summer, everything's green and idyllic, but in the winter, the branches and the trunks, they all stand out. look at how crooked they all are. the branches have to carry all of the leaves into the sunlight. it's one long struggle for survival. joe: my father surprised me by calling the naked trunks the souls of the trees. a poetic thought that was rare for him, as by his own account, he preferred the empirical sciences. seligman: and after jerome? i reacted, um... well, let's just say... aggressively. - how? - by intensifying my hunt for men. joe: you know these supermarket doors that open and close by way of some kind of sensor? now compare these doors to my cunt, and add an extraordinarily sensitive sensor. my sensitive door opening gave me an opportunity to develop my morphological studies from knees to genitals. i embarked on a trip through, what, in the lingo of children's books, one might call, ""the country of the big, bad cocks."" ""the country of the small yellow cocks,"" and so on. and most of all, i battled my way through an untold number of circumcised cocks. by the way, did you know that if you combine all the foreskin cut off through history, it would reach to mars and back again? joe: ""mrs. h.""  joe: by now, i had built up a sizable circle of men, and was starting to have trouble remembering who was who. man: hello, sweetheart. want to meet? - - man 2: it's fisher. i'm lying here thinking of you and what you said. i'm not angry at all if that's what you're thinking. - - man 3: hi, joe. it's rob again. i had a really good time seeing you. give me a... give me a call. - - man 4: hi, joe. i left a couple of messages. is everything all right? joe: i quickly gave up trying to remember the individual relationships. it was impossible. and impossible to predict what they wanted to hear. so i invented a method. joe: it was all based on chance. joe: a one meant an overly loving answer. a two, not quite as passionate, but still positive. and so on, up to five, which was a complete rejection. and six, no answer at all. the trick with this method was that i didn't have to worry about the individual relationships, but instead became completely unpredictable, which, of course, drove the men even wilder. hey, eddie, it's me. listen, i've given this a lot of thought, and i've come to the conclusion that we're done. bye. i was just wondering if you wanted to come back, and maybe we can do something nice. hi, patrick, it's joe. i had a really lovely time with you, and i'd love for you to come back. if you're interested, let me know. bye. i really don't think we match, and you're quite annoying, so i don't want to see you anymore. please don't call back. seligman: that sounds rather stressful. joe: yes, actually, it was. but fortunately, i had my little book of comfort. when i needed comfort or peace, i took out my herbarium and looked at my favorite leaves. ash, trembling aspen and lime. when you're dealing with a larger group of lovers as i was, there will typically be a difference in their qualities. h was a sticky bastard. i had invited a for dinner, as he was my favorite, while h, who was present, had become quite irritating. you have to leave. i've got guests for dinner. but he's not coming until seven. no. but seven isn't that far away. do you love me? joe: a was to arrive at seven, and i needed to get h out of there. i love you too much. you keep promising, but i understand now that you'll never leave your family for my sake. it's sad, but... it's your choice. it's not satisfying for me that i can't have you completely. which is why we can't see each other any longer. goodbye. look... have a nice life. my darling, i'm yours. i've left her. - woman: has he gone inside? - boy: yes. woman: is the door closed? - woman: uh, hello. - joe: hello. apologize. we, uh... had promised not to come up. we just wanted to... make sure he got here safely, now that he's... made the big decision. may the children see him inside? they say that the experience of saying goodbye can be very useful later when dealing with trauma. what a nice place. it's, uh... so bohemian. we used to have a place like this before we were... we were married. before the children, me and my husband. oh, i'm sorry. he isn't anymore, is he? it's all so new and confusing. he wanted to give us everything, but, uh... of course we couldn't accept that. oh, that's right. - you need the car key. - no, i don't need the car. oh, yes, you do. he likes the car. here. - please, just take it. - i don't want it. - just take it. - i don't want the fucking car! it's all right. we'll get the bus home. children might as well get used to public transport now, right? of course, their standard of living won't be the same anymore, but... i'm not saying that to bother anyone. one has to be realistic. hey. what's this? it's a present. a pillow he has embroidered himself. - wife: and who's it for? - daddy. i do hope it's all right if the children call their father ""daddy"" here. if you prefer, they can call him... ""him,"" or simply, ""the man."" whatever. ""whatever."" must be hard when you've got everything, to know what to say. to be honest, my first thought was never, ever to let either of you see the children, but then i changed my mind. i thought it only right that their father be confronted by the little people whose lives he's destroyed. give daddy your present. wife: it's a car the little dear has embroidered. i'm aware that not everyone can see it, but... with the heart one can see much, however unimportant that information may be to you. would it be all right if i show the children the whoring bed? after all, they also had a stake in this event. wife: you need to see it. right? let's go see daddy's favorite place. come on, boys. oh! so this is where it all happened. you should try to memorize this room. especially the bed. it'll stand you in good stead later in therapy. oh. here i sit rambling on about therapy without a thought of what it might cost. i do hope you don't think we're here to beg. i'm sorry. i'm sorry. being silly. mommy's being silly. let's have a cup of tea. wife: hope it's not too weak. afraid i'm rather nervous. the children's father likes two lumps of sugar in his tea. wife: mm-mm. i'll get it. - joe: mm-mm. - no, no, please, please. - hello. - hello. - yes? - uh... how nice. lovely. - boys, come here. - is joe here? this might be interesting. - this is my son. - yes. - yes. - hello, hello. - look him in the eyes. - i'm andy. hello. - friend of joe's then? - yeah. - you known each other long? - uh... not that long, no. - not very long? - no. oh. wife: a menage-a-trois. it's all so exotic. so broad-minded. on that point... i failed. no doubt about it. boys, now is the time to be alert, and ask all the questions your heart's desire. because... i hope that you shall never have to encounter such people or be in such a situation ever again. wife: well, hmm? you don't have any questions? no? well, i'll start, shall i? approximately, how many lives... do you think she has time to destroy in one day? five? 50? or several hundreds? i admit the latter sounds improbable, but where there's a will there's a way. look, this is just a big misunderstanding. boys? i don't... i don't love your father. wife: she's just saying that to make us feel better. i'm sure you understand that. because if it were a joke, i mean... if... this were really a joke, then it would be a joke so cruel. no one can be that cruel. they say that even the huns on their rampage were rather unreserved, but to split up a family... to destroy a mesh of feelings woven over 20 years is no joke, i can assure you. well... if three's a crowd, then seven must be a bit of a challenge for the pretty miss. i must say i have a hard time picturing her enjoying loneliness. i think we better grab the chance to get away before things become grotesque. - - no, no, no! you wouldn't want to give your father a guilty conscience now, would you? so how did this episode affect your life? not at all. - not at all? - no. you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. well, that's true. some people... blame the addict. other people feel sorry for the addict. but i was an addict out of lust, not out of need. you would say that, wouldn't you? and lust that led to destruction around me, everywhere i went. seligman: well, addiction sometimes leads to an... absence of empathy. you can't fight a lion and blow the noses of your children at the same time. for me, nymphomania was callousness. seligman: you're very stubborn. but what about yourself? how did you feel during all this? did you feel good, or did you feel bad? it's funny because when i think about my life as a whole, i can only say that i felt good. but when i try and remember a specific episode, i'd say that just then i felt rather bad. seligman: in what way? mrs. h was right about the loneliness. i'd be lying if i said it hadn't been my constant companion. seligman: so you were with all these men, and you still felt alone? i didn't want to tell you about it. but you've led me into a trap. it was a certain feeling. oh, how awful that everything has to be so trivial. joe: when i was seven i had to have an operation. nothing serious, but it did require anesthesia. i had already been pre-medicated, and was feeling all right. but when i looked into the room where the doctors and nurses were preparing for the operation, it was as if had to pass through an impenetrable gate all by myself. it wasn't just that i missed my mom. i don't think i missed my dad, even though he was the nice one. it was as if i was completely alone in the universe. as if my whole body was filled with loneliness and tears. and i'm still not allowed to feel sorry for you? shall we go on? joe: what are you reading? seligman: i'm not reading it really, i'm just... reacquainting myself with edgar allan poe. i don't know him. well, he was a... very anxiety-ridden man. he died in the most fearful way you can imagine, in something called delirium tremens. it occurs when the long-time abuse of alcohol is followed by... by a sudden abstinence. your body goes into some kind of hyper-sensitive shock. you can see the most horrifying hallucinations or rats and snakes, and cockroaches coming out of the floor, and worms slithering the walls. one's entire nervous system is on high alert, and you have a constant panic and paranoia. and then the circulatory system fails. but the panic and horror... remains until the moment of death. i know what delirium is. seligman: ""during the whole of a dull, dark and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, i had been passing alone on horseback through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy house of usher.""  hey, dad. hi, love. how are you? i fought with mom. she's... she's not coming. you ought not to fight with her. you know kay's fear of hospitals. i know she's not coming. we already said everything we needed to say. kay and i said goodbye at home. i don't want her here at all. - i can't accept that. - you'll have to. she's a cowardly, stupid bitch. no, she's not. - yeah. - no, she's not. - yes. - no, she's not. yes, she is. you've never understood that. doesn't it scare you? no. how can you not be afraid? i've seen so many die. and there's that epicurus quote about not fearing death. ""when we are, death has not come. when death has come... we are not."" you know it's going to happen. i also know all the drugs the doctors have to offer. so, no. i am not... i am not afraid. hmm. my beautiful girl. - beautiful dad. - hello, doctor. hello, doctor. this is my daughter joe. - hey, joe. - hi. doctor: do you need anything? as i've said, i've decided to be an exemplary patient, completely subjecting myself - to doctor's orders. - are you in pain? i don't think so, no. we're going to give you a splash all the same. your hair is longer. no, it's not. they're giving you too much medication. no. - dad. - it's okay, dad. you're just dreaming. you're having a nightmare. it's okay. it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. okay. don't worry, i'm going to get the doctor. don't worry. you must be exhausted. i'm fine. i think you should go home, get some rest. no. someone needs to be here. perhaps you could share with some other family members. there aren't any others. kay! - daddy, it's okay. - kay? kay. kay. kay. kay. kay! kay. -  kay! - i'm going to get the doctor. kay! i'm going to get the doctor, daddy. excuse me. my dad is really unwell. sit. i'll go have a look. maybe you could give him some more morphine. there's something i'd like to explain. i can certainly give him more morphine, but most likely it won't make much difference. most deaths, fortunately, are uneventful, as long as you medicate the patients to keep them free of fear and pain. in a few cases, the process of dying causes brain damage, which triggers what we call delirium. that's not something we can soften with morphine, unfortunately. daddy. it's gonna be okay. i don't know what's happening to me. don't you want to take a little walk? i'll stay with your father in the meantime. you'll stay? you'll stay here? yes. ash tree leaves. where did you find them? they were in the park. it truly is the most beautiful tree in the forest. but dad... how do you recognize it in winter? told you 100 times. i can't remember. when the ash tree was created... it made all the other trees in the forest jealous, because it was... it was the most beautiful tree in the forest. it had the strongest wood. it could be used for anything. it was the world tree in norse mythology. you couldn't say anything bad about it. and then when all the other trees saw the ash tree with its black buds... they all started laughing. ""oh, look. the ash tree's had its fingers in the ashes."" - - dad. daddy! daddy. daddy, what's wrong? - - daddy, what's wrong? daddy, it's me! it's me, then. it's me! - - help! help! okay. - - okay. okay. it's okay, it's okay. it's all right. woman: it's all right. doctor: we have to fixate him. father: what are you doing? what are you doing to me? father: joe! what are you doing to me? father: joe! joe! i'm sorry. doctor: you should take a break. joe: excuse me. okay, don't worry. just clean that up. woman: ready? joe: when he died, i had no feelings left. seligman: well, that's certainly understandable. joe: no. i don't know what happened to me. it was very shameful. seligman: shameful? i don't understand. joe: i lubricated. i know you like to present yourself in a negative way, and that you have this, kind of dark bias that you're worse than everyone else. but this story doesn't add to that belief. it's extremely common to react sexually in a crisis. it may be shameful to you, but... in literature, there is many worse examples. but i did inherit my father's caliper. i found it so beautiful and worn by its use. what else did you receive? nothing. i didn't have the strength to argue with my mother, so i wrote off any further part of my inheritance. really? well, that's a dramatic gesture. - you listen to music, i see? - seligman: yes. i like it a lot. shall i find a tape? no, if there's a tape already in the machine? i'd like to hear that. it's something i've been listening to a lot lately, though it's not an entirely complete recording, unfortunately. - what is it? - it's bach. from his little organ book. the theme is originally a hymn, bach rearranged it and embellished it a little. he was the master at polyphony, if you know what that is. no, yet another thing i don't know. seligman: polyphony is from the middle ages. it's an entirely european phenomenon. it's distinguished by the idea that, every voice is its own melody, but together in harmony. bach's forerunner, palestrina, he wrote many words for several choirs at the same time, wallowing in polyphony. but in my eyes, bach perfected the melodic expression and the harmony. and also mixed up with some rather incomprehensible mystique regarding numbers, most likely based on the fibonacci sequence. you know the one that starts with the zero, and then comes the one. the sequence is created by adding the two previous numbers to create the new one, so it's zero plus one makes one. and one plus one makes two, and two plus one makes three and three plus two makes five, and five plus three makes eight, and eight plus five makes 13. the sequence has an interesting connection to pythagoras' theorem of the golden section. it was all about finding out a divine methodology in art and architecture. a bit like the way a tri-tone, which was played on the piano in your little club was supposed to be a satanic interval. the sum of the numeric values represented in bach's name is 14, a number he often used in his compositions. the clever thing about bach's name is that the numeric value of the individual letters are all fibonacci numbers. this piece has three voices: the bass voice... the second voice played with the left hand. the first voice played with the right hand. that is called cantus firmus, or cantu firmus. and together, these three voices create the polyphony. well, if i should compare this with my story, it's reminiscent of a quality of nymphomania, which is normally ignored, but nonetheless essential, and namely the relationship between the various intercourses. that's interesting. they create a... a completeness? as, for example, the handshake, which for all people is the sum of all the different handshakes that together form our view of what a handshake is. the good, the bad handshake, the firm, the limp. normally, a nymphomaniac is seen as... someone who can't get enough, and therefore, has sex with many different people. well, that, of course, is true, but if i'm to be honest, i see it precisely as the sum of all these different sexual experiences. so in that way, i have only one lover.  joe: since the music has three voices, i will limit myself to talking about three lovers. the bass is easy. that's f. f had a red car that he'd bought used. joe: as i was having sex with seven or eight men every night at the time, scheduling was tricky. and they all had to have precise appointments. f was a good man. if he was scheduled for ten o'clock, he always showed up around nine and parked down in the street. i always smiled when i saw him. often i took pity on him, and gave him a cup of coffee, although i was finishing with the one before. it's hard to say why i'm choosing to talk about f, but he was reassuring, and he knew exactly what i wanted when we had sex. no, i'd go even further, and say that there was a kind of telepathy going on when we had sex. without words, he knew exactly what i wanted, where he should touch me and what he should do. the most sacred goal for f was my orgasm. - why? and then... - the swans answered in the same voice. joe: and granted him privileges none of the others received. f was the bass voice. monotone, predictable and ritualistic. no doubt about it. but also the foundation that is so important, even if on its own it doesn't mean much. g was quite different. the only one i had to, and wanted to wait for. when he finally turned up and i opened the door, he didn't immediately enter, the way a cat doesn't when you let it in. as if, once the door is open, it has all the time in the world. but he was more than a cat. he was like some kind of jaguar, or leopard. he moved like them, which turned me on no end. joe: when he laid down on my bed, it was clear to me that i should approach him, and not the other way round. and when i did touch him, it was with some hesitation, as his reactions were unpredictable. he was in charge. that's the way it was. joe: despite my success in managing the complicated logistics involved with arranging up to ten daily sexual satisfactions, while also having a full-time job, i was still prone to a certain sadness. so when my busy life allowed a few breaks, i used them to take my walks. these repeated walks became a kind of metaphor for my life. monotonous and pointless. yes, precisely like the movements of a caged animal. basically, we're all waiting for permission to die. seligman: no. no, no, no. no, there... there are some completely unrealistic coincidences in your story about jerome. first, by chance, he hires you as... as an assistant. and then you take a walk in a forest, and it's littered with photographs of him. and not only that... he's present. and then like a god, pulls you up to him through the clouds. so what? that's the way this story goes. and i'm the one telling it, and i know what happened. do you want to hear it or not? seligman: goodness gracious. what a strange way to meet. yes. it's a very strange way. joe: jerome was there because he'd just had a fight with his wife, who in anger tore up the photographs they just had developed from their travels. i don't know if i can believe this. joe: which way do you think you'd get the most out of my story? by believing in it or not believing in it? seligman: yeah, you're right. you might have a point with all this. the secret ingredient to sex is love. the third voice, the secret ingredient. cantus firmus. fill all my holes. what's wrong? hmm? - i can't feel anything. - huh? i can't feel anything. i can't feel anything. i can't... anything.  "
Von Trier,The Boss of It All,"(man) here comes a movie and, if it already looks a bit weird, then hang in there, because anyone can see it although you see my reflection, trust me, this film won't be worth a moment's reflection. it's a comedy, and harmless as such. no preaching or swaying of opinion. just a cozy time. so why not poke fun at artsy-fartsy culture? so here we have a self-important out-of-work actor who, by miraculous chance, got a job. a very special job. hello. so we finally meet. i'm the company president. i'm the company president. i've given mr. ravn power of attorney to conclude the deal. hello again... ""optional."" - kristoffer? butterflies? -no. let's get this done. it's our non-disclosure agreement. you said you'd never written for the stage? may i ask why? this text is succinct and intense. - but it says far more than it says. - really? i had hoped it would say as little as possible. the sanctions might seem drastic, but that's law for you. the main thing is that you keep this a secret. - secret? - but you're used to that. you don't shoot someone on stage and tell the crowd: ""i'm only acting."" i don't know. that particular statement applies to many of gambini's anti-characters. - i'm your man, ravn. - great. you're playing the boss. i'm in a bit of a pinch because the real boss is... not accessible. we must act now. the icelanders are so damn pushy. it won't take too long, so you'll be making quite a bundle, seeing as you're not working. sign here. i don't keep busy just to be busy. - it's not illegal or anything! - legal or illegal, i don't care. i'm an actor. the character is my law. and the script is my court. court? let's pray it never gets that far. excellent... your money. - what's that on your forehead? - soot. i always rely on gambini. you can't go wrong. the hanged cat? the chimney sweep's monologue from a town without chimneys. - you know it? -1 only know top cat. ""i have traveled far, and with reluctance, to this town."" our president doesn't have soot on his forehead. the things a character doesn't have define him more than what he has. theater begins to unfold itself at the point where it ends. don't make me nervous, kristoffer. let's keep it simple. i'll just endow my character with a small tribute to gambini. fine! it won't make any difference. you're only the boss for a moment. then there's the pauses... so vital to our understanding. he could actually not say anything at all. you have to say what's on the page. otherwise, what's the point? just what's on the page. hello. so we finally meet. i'm the company president. i finally tracked him down. - this is finnur... - (man corrects pronunciation) (speaks icelandic) ""hello. so we finally meet. i'm the company president."" hello. so we finally meet. i'm the company president. (man translates into icelandic) yes, both you gents are indeed company presidents. - but for two different companies. - (man continues translating) (speaks icelandic) ""why do danes talk so much? ""no wonder this country came to a halt intellectually 200 years ago. ""they yak away or are drippingly sentimental. - ""the rest of the time they giggle."" - (giggles) ""let's for god's sake get started, mr. ravn."" dear mr. president - and i'm referring to our own little president - we're happy just to have a president. i want to say the following... our president has requested to be kept out of the negotiations. did i get that right? the price is our top priority. and we've already agreed on it. i have... turned over... power... of attorney... to mr.... ravn. i'm sorry... i didn't quite get that. the pauses confused me. would you mind repeating it a bit quicker? i have turned over power of attorney to mr. ravn. (man translates) once our president's mind is made up, no amount of ruckus can change it. (man begins to translate) mr. president... all these presidents! should we call ours ""the danish president""? icelandic or danish... same thing! - 400 jolly years under icelandic rule. - it was the other way round. it sure as hell didn't feel that way to us. no. well, i better get back to the states. just because i'll sign on the 12th doesn't make it less fun. (shouts in icelandic) ""you fucking danes aren't getting off that lightly. ""it's all talk, fucking slave drivers! ""fortunately the sagas left us these wise words: ""he who deals with stooges deals with nobody."" - goodbye. - finnur! ""i insist that the president ""deal with me on the 12th. not his stooge. ""he'll have to stay home that week or there's no deal. ""you'll be hearing from my lawyer."" bye then... ""optional."" hello. so we finally meet. i'm the company president. shit! they weren't supposed to see you. - word will spread like wildfire. - they could tell i wasn't for real. - they had no time to tell finnur... - that's not the problem. they looked shocked because they thought you were the real president. well, i did play him well. although you didn't give me much to work with. if the performance is topnotch physical resemblance has less significance. the physical resemblance with their president often years is irrelevant. they've never seen him. - never seen him? -no. -1 don't quite get it. - if i wasn't such a wuss. companies need presidents. i didn't have it in me. i couldn't see myself as one. so when i started the company i told them i was an employee. that the president was tending to his companies and lived in the states. i know it's strange and suspicious. a boss that i invented, kristoffer. it was fine as long as no one wanted to talk to him. then that fucking icelander came along. they don't trust anyone. strange... they called gambini strange too. look... i told you i was your man. i am... and not just any man. i'm an actor. that's exactly what you need to make your world work. - it's only a week. i'll write a contract. - no need. it's a hobby of mine. this deal is vital to the company. the slightest doubt... i have considerable training in sensing doubt in the minds of my audience. -v you'll have to meet the staff. -v being seen is part of the job. - if you talk, i'll slaughter you! - stop fussing. heidi a.? would you get the six seniors together? i want you to meet someone special. they're the six i started out with. here at last... the boss of it all. he took a week out of his schedule to be with us in denmark. probably because deep down inside he's... danish. and perhaps he feels he has... maybe not abandoned, our little branch. yes, that's understandable. that's understandable. yes, that is understandable. so there's lots for you to talk about. i guess i'll stick my tail between my legs, as they say... and scoot on back to my office. any questions? what's your name? - my name? -yes. no one's ever called you anything but ""the boss of it all."" some of the girls had the honor of getting emails with specific details. let me make it clear that it's been at random, who i needed to write directly to over the years. there's no personal preference there. holy smoke... one does have to be careful. - his name is svend. - svend e. that's what my emails said. what does the e stand for? didn't i write that? ravn didn't say? for ten years? never, ever?! that's good news. because that means... i can tell you that i have a name i'm very partial to... and proud of. ecker... eckersberg... svend eckersberg. - and what should i call you? - gorm wants to call you svend. gorm may call me whatever he likes. gorm may even call me kristoffer, if he likes. why should he call you kristoffer? no, why on earth should he? why in the world should he? - by all means, call me svend. - ok, svend. i'd like to say one thing. - autumn in the country is muggy. - gorm, don't. real muggy! i want you to know that. people generally think autumn has a freshness to it. no, gorm! - are you done now? huh?! - everything's cool. - are you done? - yeah. sorry, sorry. everything is perfectly fine. stop it! boy, that's nasty. i'm afraid you'll have to apologize. should i apologize to him?! don't forget the tech conference tomorrow. tech conference... ravn... they're all completely insane. - we need to talk. - on neutral ground! i'll call you. ok. if my character's name is svend, for example, then i'd like to know. -1 just want to be in the loop. - sure. the names didn't really matter. gorm is a country boy. he sometimes suffers from rural depression. - but he's a wizard with brooker 5. - what the hell is that? our flagship, our biggest seller. that's what we started out with. my character doesn't like when they cry, shout or hit. my personal space has been violated. i must insist on control. they must be subdued. the six seniors can be a bit of a hassle. they're the creative bunch in the firm. i don't know about the psychology of actors, but i imagine it's similar. so things are that bad? i love them dearly. although they have knocked me around a bit. it can't be as bad as slagelse in 1992. though i did talk the women ticket holders down after the show. i didn't know slagelse had a theater. and they didn't, artistically speaking. -v what's wrong? what was that? -v my mournful and remote look. - it must terrify people. - yes, it's effective. the six seniors were more feisty than i'd expected. this tech conference sounds ominous. tell me about what you do, so i can learn the lingo. it. that's impossible to grasp! i don't stand a chance. good thing you're such a good actor. you're prepared now. subdue them, take control. all right? (photocopier starts up) wow... it's quite a shocker when the copy machine starts. luckily it's not that often. only a thousand times a day. how's the weather out in the country today? well, let's just assume that it's wintry like it is throughout the country. looking for your office? i figured the office would be a safer bet than the corridors. safer? what do you mean? so people can find me. since i'm here rather seldom. so you want to see them? i told them to wait. i'll pass it on. - thanks. - jokumsen is waiting outside. i don't know how he found out you were here. it's the deficiency list for the db7 patch. i doubt if he's lightened up since he last complained. should we push jokumsen till after the tech conference? sorry. he's acted as our boss when the boss wasn't here. we start off with the management's visions. i'd like to hear more about the visions. i studied the old corporate philosophy. and, as such, certain technical and strategic measures seem most unclear. transaction hierarchy... why not? the 80:20 rule. agile development. that's just a minor part of the terms necessary to define it at an acceptable level. aside from those fucking terms, what's the boss' definition of transaction hierarchy? and the 80:20 rule? maybe i dozed off, but what is it? ""agile development"" is defined in seven or eight different ways. how would you define it? (clears throat) define... ""dictate,"" i'm tempted to say. there is a very fine line between defining and dictating. and it all boils down to whether the boss wants to dictate. or rather whether the boss has any idea what we do in this company. or whether you have any idea what we do at this company. -1 should certainly say so. - what, then? - what? - what we do? didn't you prepare a presentation? what do we do? - this and that. in general? - yes, for example. uhh... uh... hi, everyone. i just have a practical announcement. oh, nalle... such a pouty face. come on. upsy-daisy... and a big hug. what was the practical nature of your announcement, ravn? (ravn clears throat) the trip to kullen is off. but we were going because we didn't go last year. (broken danish) can anybody tell me... what... that...? - keep quiet, spencer. - work on it. i am afraid the decision came from above. i know it reflects a hard policy about perks. i'm sure there's a perfectly good reason. the reason we're not going is because the boss of it all says so. ""because the boss of it all says so."" that's a fucking old line. why don't the six of us just take our rights to brooker 5 and leave? - be nice, gorm. - but you're not nice to us. we all agree we'd be far better off without the fucking boss of it all. let's not dampen the good mood. it's my fault. and this conference is not for debating whether the boss is a hard-ass or not. let's hear what svend has to say. - svend? - come on, svend! we usually get the sales figures, though not at the tech conference. maybe you can give us an idea, if you've seen them. -v of course i have seen them. -v (gorm) so how do they look? they're shit. now it's finally out. they're shit. they're piss. they're pig swill. we need to turn this ship round! those figures had better look completely different. - now it's out in the open. - there, mette. (gorm) but the figures look fine in your mails. did mette say they were fine? all i can say, mette, is that they aren't good enough. far, far from it, mette. - now poor mette is crying again. - there, mette. they're just numbers. (knock at door) they are lined up outside. you want to see lise and spencer, or jokumsen? anyone but jokumsen. his complaint seems legitimate. - lise is our hr representative. - sure, why not? - spencer has something to say. - (broken danish) we will work longer... -v no longer. -v no longer. we will no longer accept thighs... - these. - ...working conditions. it's easier for me to say it when you can't say it properly. he means ""working conditions."" our working conditions are dreadful. so is the personnel policy. other companies have perks. here's a list. would you mind leaving, heidi? all the way out. so you are affiliated with certain biker circles. i would be naive to think their racket is limited to small shopkeepers. with the hell's angels up your sleeve, your demands require a different approach. but keep quiet about it. hr. hr. human resources. you've been in the states so long, you can't remember what it means. i'll look it up for you in english. you can tell me. you can fess up. i discussed it with the others. we think you have a credibility problem. your personality gives you away. you're not who you pretend to be. i think you should come clean. you think that's a wise thing to do at this point? - you think so? -yes. it wouldn't change much. you're so transparent. all your lines really lack cred. it's lousy acting from start to finish. my lines lack cred? you are too much! let's not forget ""lousy acting."" that's when audiences are shook up. don't they get that the point of comedy nowadays is to reveal the comedy? disaster has already struck. it's all in the aftermath. people just want things to be credible and natural. give me a fucking break! - you have a credibility problem. - no, i don't. - yes, you do. - no, i don't. i don't know much about you, but i know what you aren't. then tell me what i'm not, for fuck's sake! gay. - gay? - yes, gay. it's not so much that you try to make me think you're gay, but you also pretend to be oblivious to it, management, and even human resources. hell's angels. honestly! of course you're an expert, otherwise you would never have made it this big. - am i right? -yeah. why would you think i was gay? all those emails you sent me, distancing yourself from me. - and you got ravn to plant the idea. - what pleasure would i get from that? the same you get from looking like a complete jackass, professionally. to seem interesting or make us feel sorry for you. you hit home with that one. the thing about pretending to be completely oblivious to it, it was a bit naive, i admit. - but i am gay. - you don't seem gay at all. that's how some of us are. and it's not to win you over. sorry about that. i've been a cornholer since birth. there is no explanation for it. but rather a poop pusher than a dry old stick. i can explain why you've always gone for men. you haven't met the right woman yet. on neutral ground, asap. i'm exhausted, fumbling in the dark. no control whatsoever. it would be easier if i knew what i had said or written in my past. i mean, gay! you could have told me. - dammit, ravn! - you're right. but only lise's president is gay. you told them different things?! i hear you. - you told them different things? -1 understand the question. are you a complete idiot? it created a good vibe. everyone felt he belonged to them. and in that sense, he did. - and that it shit? i don't get it. - me neither. - you're doing great. - you think? stick it out a couple of more days. take my advice, kristoffer. don't take it so seriously. all that stuff about controlling and subduing is probably fine, but it's easier not to. make the audience do the work. then you won't feel so stressed out. just say yes. when they come to you - ""yes."" maybe not so artistic, but it works. say yes! but that's improvisational theater. like when some jackass gets it into his head he should put on a dress, and we all have to applaud it. gambini didn't believe in it. to him, improvisation was just kowtowing to the parlor drama. gambini was one of the first to see through ibsen. ibsen was a moron! too prim to grab disaster by the throat. why not go straight to soap? with all its sentimentality and fucking cliches. ""this is not adieu, au revoiii"" or shit like that. it's bull. - it's bull. bull. - sure. calm down. i'm sorry. you know best. it's your character and idea. and the idea is god. even hitler's. if you want improvisation and group theater, i'll give it to you. i'll say yes, until you choke on it. but not to jokumsen. he has had a legitimate complaint for six years. - why didn't he come six years ago? -he did. but the boss of it all wasn't in that day. - oh, i see. - and about those it terms? when they say ""outsourcing,"" they mean ""offshoring."" piece of cake. the clib module performance issues are more extensive than we thought. bottlenecks throughout the system. we should put far more validations client-side. outsourcing is very tempting, but as the clib module... excuse me. you mean offshoring. you said outsourcing, but you mean offshoring. of course. thank you, svend. what does the boss of it all say? do nalle and mette get a green light? - you mean yes or no? -1 think i can answer that. we all can. ""a third cheaper and we go ahead."" - is nalle right in his assumption? -yes. the boss of it all has spoken. you just had to take nalle down a peg. rap his knuckles with everyone watching. you're a real bastard. yes. upsy-daisy. and a big hug. cute, right? like a little baby. no, wait, babies mean procreation, and that entails screwing members of the opposite sex. (photocopier starts up) if you have any questions or requests of me, then the answer might be yes. is there anything i can say? or that anyone can say? they might say yes. or yes, yes, yes. - i've had it, svend. you read me? -yes. you better! all your gay crap. -1 know when a man lusts after me. - (clears throat) yes. - you're such a tease. -yes. all those emails. ""be nice to ravn, lise. take care of ravn."" - they were meant to get me going. -yes. that faggy farce is all very well, but there are better fish to fry. - fine by me. -yes. - as long as you're in control, right? -yes. right here, right now. the sooner the better. - you male chauvinist pig. -yes. there will be no fucking till you get a proper blow-job. and now, over the desk i go. that's just the way it is. -yes. - right? you like it best when i have no say in the matter. don't let it confuse you, but i have two holes. -yes. - right. so that's why they call you the boss of it all. - you are a bastard. -yes. -yes. - yes, yes, yes. is that all you can say?! - are you familiar with gambini? -who? you look tired. i told jokumsen he couldn't see you today. i told him to try again next week. hope that's all right. - that's fine, 'cause i won't be here. - are you leaving again? by the way, thanks for all your greetings from round the world. they meant a lot to me. and i've replied to all of them. apart from one. yes. yes, that's right. there was one you didn't reply to. why didn't you? -you want to talk about it now? - i'm here now. that's true. (stutters) you're always making jokes about everything. sometimes it confuses me. i can't tell if you are joking. why would you think it was a joke? it could hardly be anything else. if it hadn't been a joke, what would you have said? i think you know. no. that's why i am asking. - if it wasn't a joke... -yes. ...i would have said yes. that's nuts, seeing as we hardly know each other. you don't seem thrilled about my yes. sorry. how stupid of me. this is embarrassing. that's why i didn't reply. of course it was a joke. yes, and it's funny. i'm so stupid, i thought you meant it. sorry. i'm going all red. i think that... it's great that you would have said yes. not everyone would. i respect you for it. my goodness. great. can we just forget about it? i can't believe i was so ambiguous that you were in doubt. it's not like me. it's not in character. sometimes we ask questions in jest that we'd like an answer to, in case we ever ask for real. i just thought there were real feelings there. come on! you think i'd cover my bets like that? and fish for an answer out of fear? does that sound like the boss of it all? a man is a man, a word is a word, and a boss is a goddamn boss. i didn't build an empire by farting around like that. heidi a. i remember that mail clearly. if you ask me whether i meant it, the answer is yes. and the question still stands. - damn right! -oh. ""oh"" is right. - i'm so happy. - if you're happy, i'm happy. it wasn't just to keep me from quitting? of course not. what does that have to do with it? and i didn't quit. i stayed with you. -you did. - mainly because of your email. yes, and i think it's time to knock off, even for the boss. i'm glad we got that little matter sorted to our mutual satisfaction. you look like something is bugging you again. - everything will be fine. - i'm just so happy you meant it. especially considering how little you know about me. isn't there anything you'd like to ask me? of course there is, heidi a. what does the a stand for? not that it matters. no, because now it'll be heidi e. heidi eckersberg. all right, then. (man) oh, no! just as things were working out why this break? not to mention this primitive, pointless zoom? / declare, no comedy without breaks. vitamins must be injected, however reluctant we are. and who likes being the doctor with his syringe, interrupting a child's play? you're right yours truly. and i hereby feel obliged to introduce a new character. the boss is horny as hell. there's probably still a slight trace of homophilia in his dong. the boss will be right with you. how was the cred in that line, toots? not bad, ""toots."" - kisser! you don't work with it. - the same goes for you. i don't remember you looking this happy. but we were only married for 5 years. or was it 50? were you ever happy? yes, when drooling over that gambini jerk. a hoax nobody's ever heard of. a hoax in seven-league boots. with gambini, disaster has already struck. a one-act play, three hours long! the chimney sweep's monologue'. too much christmas carol for my taste. - no wonder i couldn't stand you. -1 couldn't stand you, either. -v why not? -v peanuts. you ate them with the shells on. they only do that in cartoons. it drove me crazy! i bet you're here to get something. - come to win me back? -1 don't want you back. for something else, then. you're so damned efficient. i bet you graduated even before you started. and got promoted. i'm finnur sigurdsson's attorney. wow, capitalism! weren't you going to use your degree to fight it? yes, i believe i was. finnur mentioned me, but you forgot. life is a dogma film. it's hard to hear, but the words are still important. i'm here to assess the likelihood of the president's presence tomorrow, at the sales talks with my client. so far, i have my doubts. all i know is you're not him. why couldn't i? why couldn't i be the boss of it all? like the chimney sweep from the town without chimneys? - always with soot on his forehead. - maybe you were wrong. maybe there is more to me than you saw back then. yes. - but there isn't, is there? -no. not according to what they teach at law school. what we learnt was more tangible. is that really the president, or isn't he the president? all right, i'm a stand-in. my lips are sealed. i signed a non-disclosure agreement. a non-disclosure with old ravn? dammit, kristoffer! he's really got you by the balls. he's a whiz with contracts. are you going to blow the whistle on me? then i'd have done it ten years ago when you started acting... toots. - but i see you love the part. -1 am good at it. seems so. and parts for you don't exactly grow on trees. and it goes against your convictions to check things thoroughly. - all you want is attention. -1 keep these it nerds in check. so that the rightful owner can do business. in law we say, ""too stupid for words."" and that's you, if you believe ravn. ravn is all right. we get along fine. he loves his staff, but lacks the strength to be the boss. he's a wuss, but not malicious. not unless he exploits the system to drive his staff to the utmost. by blaming all the shit on this boss you can appear likable and noble. - why do you care? -1 don't. but once i saw a shred of decency in you. you're not as bad as you'd like to be, kristoffer. you almost looked like you considered the moral aspects. all of ravn's dealings benefit the company and thereby his staff. this is a good deal for their beloved workplace. possibly. and since ravn is as noble as you perceive him to be, i'm sure he has told his staff that their beloved workplace is the subject of tomorrow's deal. - is ravn selling the company? - yes. simple as that. no, you didn't. you didn't manipulate me. you've been quite the gentleman. even when i almost quit to work for our worst competitor. you've laid into ravn a few times. he's looked a bit sad after a phone call from you. well... i have to pop down... to make some copies. does anyone else feel manipulated? not me, but gorm does. that was a serious blow. he took it hard when you overruled him on the brooker platform issue. he'd spent two years on the other platform. how can you even dictate things concerning the brooker? it's ours. not me, but nalle does. you were out of line. you told him he never came prepared. then everyone started in on him. you knew he'd snap. (in english) hi. can i ask you a question in english? danish. - (in english) let's do it in english. - no, danish. (chuckles) you took away his danish lessons so he couldn't gossip in the corridors. - couldn't he just gossip in english? - sure, but he didn't want to. and me... not apart from making me see to ravn. but that didn't benefit you. - what about ravn? - our cuddly teddy bear? you can't help loving him. although he's pathetic at times. maybe i shouldn't mention it, but his personal finances are a mess. - how do you know? - he said so. mostly at first. then we discussed it and decided to lend him 25,000 each. not that it helped. - why not? - he hasn't paid us back yet. - and there's poor mette. -yeah. you know what happened after you sacked her husband? - no, i don't think so. - he hung himself. with a printer cable. he couldn't take being excluded. he begged to let him come back. ravn told us about the letters he sent you. but we had nothing for the guy. no, that's life. - and now she's poor mette. - where is she? in the copy room, i guess. - elisabeth, is the copier working? -yes. - (woman screams) - there. (woman sobs) (fairground music) it's pure fantasy. there has to be some rumors. i deserve a bit of goodwill for starting the business. they didn't stake the 150,000. that's exactly what they did. they all lent you money, and you used it to start the company. -1 know it looks a bit shady. - it sure does! i'm the director, you're just the actor. ask your character if the pieces fit. i did, and i'm afraid they do. if i'm really such an asshole they're better off selling, so they're rid of me. we have to sign the power of attorney. i've stipulated a minimum price so you can't sell for less. kristoffer shouldn't put one over on svend by selling for a buck. (laughs) - don't i get to keep one? - if you insist. i'm no better or worse than anyone else. - i'm not so sure. -1 feel so misunderstood. i give and give. do i get anything in return? rarely, rarely. 254 million. not exactly peanuts. strindberg was misunderstood, too. people were always talking. they said he pushed his wife down the stairs. - and he didn't? - sure. but that doesn't make him any less of a writer. the account number is there, too. very handy. (translates into icelandic) so our nordic friends won't have to lug that cash around. (man translates into icelandic) it's not the account number. it's the price. that should more than cover it. (man continues translating) that's the estimated value of your company, sir. shall we sign? there... (clears throat) may i draw your attention to a couple of places where i've simplified the text? the clause about the staff not staying on. fine. i trust you completely. the staff will stay on, right? that's not what we agreed. (finnur speaks icelandic) we're not getting stuck with a bunch of fucking danes. mr. ravn is the only employee who will stay on. i also took out a couple of commas on the transfer of the brooker 5 patent from its owner, mr. ravn. what do the other rights holders get? nothing. mr. ravn has the sole rights. the six seniors think they have rights, too. emotionally, maybe. but legally, no. they worked on the program, but that was their job. excuse me for a moment. some fresh air might be good. it's all very touching, but you can't change anything. if i don't sell to finnur, i'll find another buyer. and you can't screw me by selling cheaper. come on. - mr. president. - all right. let's seal the deal. about time, too. it's rather sad to have to part with all of this. but as mr. ravn knows, i'm a businessman at heart. (speaks icelandic) then let's get down to business. i have really grown fond of this place. it's been my stage for quite a few years now. lovely thoughts, but it's history. we have some contracts to sign. thanks, ravn. always so helpful. at your service. sign right there. i'll move my finger so you can get on with it. don't you agree, mr. finnur? mr. ravn is very helpful. i don't share your soppy danish sentimentality. all that's left is to sign. a note to the lawyer who typed up the contract. putting the page number in the middle of the wording is a bad idea. i don't know how you do things in iceland... it's not the page number. it's the purchase price. my copy states the ridiculous sum of 254 million. (shouts in icelandic) that's what we agreed on, for fuck's sake. i can't sell my life's work for that. surely you understand. how much does the president want for his company? - more than that. - how much more? 50 cents. it's purely symbolic. as a businessman, i like to feel i have profited. we talk of free will, but we heed the machine within. the machine that wants gold. ticktock, ticktock... ticktock, ticktock... ticktock, ticktock... ticktock, ticktock... ticktock, ticktock... ticktock, ticktock... sometimes a mere crumb can satisfy the hunger. we'll have to retype the contracts. we can amend them by hand. i know it's a businessman's argument. but, if i can get 50 cents more... then i can get 50 million. mr. finnur? finnur! there it is! the town without chimneys. it's been there all the time. everything comes together for an instant only to be blown to bits in a gambinian explosion. (man) sadly, the oft-mentioned gambini did not pen our little comedy. his contempt would have distorted the genre beyond recognition. obey the laws of the genre. however beautiful the sight of two men asking nothing of each other, we know there are men who demand things of each other. and these demands must be met before we can leave the cinema and with a clear conscience forget everything we've seen. - why the fuck didn't you sign?! - (man) shh. i understand your question. oh, really? it's a lot of money. you piss me off! - i'm sick of your moods. - you're firing them. you neglected to say that. you're robbing them blind. brooker 5, whatever that is. you piss me off. (rustles paper loudly) you're the company lawyer and their friend. you should have told them they needed contracts. they don't even suspect they're losing their jobs. (man laughs) - it's a bit harsh. - no shit. (sighs) let's just finish the deal. that was the whole idea, but i'm willing to make a trade-off. confess! tell them you're sacking them. -1 promise. -1 don't trust you. all you've done is trick me. sign this promise, confessing you're firing them and taking their rights. i have done what i could. i'm not thrilled about signing something. the idea is god. you said so yourself. even if hitler was the writer. at the time, i didn't know the writer was hitler. if you're serious about confessing, then sign it. and a maximum price, to stop you pulling these stunts. (man) shut up down there! today... is a very grave day. (clears throat) i have decided to tell you something i should have told you ages ago. i can't do this... - you don't have to say it. - let him get on with it. yes, i do. j who never lets us down? j ravn (man) j in whose arms do we drown? (all) j ravn's j who deserves the crown? (all) j ravn, ravn, ravn... you're all so sweet. it just makes it worse. if it's really important, just get it over with. - you'll be angry. - we'll be angrier if you don't. i've been planning something. what have you been planning? - to fire all six of you. - excuse me? to fire you without any compensation for brooker 5. that's quite a plan. dammit, ravn. - dammit, ravn. - dammit. - ravn, dammit. - dammit. dammit, ravn! holy shit. may i pose a question before we all attack ravn? why did you plan this, ravn? why fire us? - why cheat us out of brooker 5? - because... yes...? (sighs) because... the boss of it all said so. i should've known. he didn't even have the guts to tell us himself. - autumn is muggy. - gorm... - autumn is muggy. - stop it. autumn is fucking muggy! gorm! stop it! i didn't have the guts after all. they've got memories like... like... like... elephants? yes. i lie awake at night. i see their eyes before me. forgiveness, you say! they'll never forgive me. poor mette is the worst. nothing i say is good enough for that girl. i'm such a wuss! they can't forgive you if you don't confess. we had a contract. ""i promise to confess."" - who signed? -1 confessed to my plan. and told them that i forced you! that's not a confession. - that's not what i meant. - why didn't the contract say so? unfortunately for you, law is an extremely exact science. and therefore i demand that you honor the contracts you have signed, and sell. i've set up one last meeting with finnur. you don't want to show your face at work. so i've told them you're in the states until the day of the signing. hi. it's me. we have to meet. on neutral ground. mm! legally, you can't touch him. he's got you. you have to sell. - it's a total downer. -yes. but he almost confessed, right? you have a knack for deliberate mental cruelty. you're right. but i'm better at being irritating on an intuitive level. what's his greatest fear? not being loved. that's what it's all about. he wants to be the big, cuddly teddy, otherwise he loses it. take his place as the cuddly teddy bear. do what ravn did. only better. mm! (chuckles) good morning. hello there. do you have room for tiny little me? ravn! won't you join us? the more the merrier. we thought you were in the states. i was supposed to be. but i can see my valued u.s. buddies any time. but my most invaluable friends... i have only two more days with. - right, ravn? -yes. two more days in the bosom of the family. autumn is a meteorological bombshell. speaking of bombshells, i have a confession to make. things got a bit heated last time. but when i tell you why i really came, you'll see you were wrong about me. - you're a bastard. - quite possibly. but maybe not the way you think. i've been withholding information from you. that makes everything much better. gee, thanks, we forgive you. i haven't been acting alone. there has been someone in the wings. this person deserves to be brought out into the light. it's someone above me. my superior, my boss. -v it's getting very technical. -v and who might that be? it is... ...the boss of the boss of it all. now it's getting really complicated. (broken danish) can anybody tell me what this means? no. so where is this boss of the boss of it all? in america. no surprise there. so you're not the real boss who makes the decisions? i've had to disappoint jokumsen on that point, too. all his anger and reproaches must, like yours, find a new target. i'm glad to hear it. you're all right, svend. i could tell right away. we hicks have to know these things. as the boss' representative, allow me to apologize for the brooker platform business. because you were right all along. you can't help loving him, right? (use laughs) and to raise our spirits even more... the staff outing to kullen is set for tomorrow. - great! - let's have one fun day together. how about a big group hug? come on, ravn! (shouts of encouragement, laughter) -v come on, mette! -v go, poor mette...! (man giggles) what are you hoping to achieve? nothing. we're just having fun. right here! palnatoke bragged to harald bluetooth about how great a skier he was. ""if you're that great, ski down the kullen from here."" - and he did, right here. - then what? - eh, i didn't read that far. - a human fault. you're evolving. and now palnatoke will demonstrate his own unique telemark style! (pop music) - ouch! - what's with your hand? it's my wrist. it's gone... limp again. i'm afraid it's a relapse. we'll soon fix that. j the most resilient of men (all) s svend j our new-found dearest friend (all) s svend j eleven out often (all) j svend, svend, svend more brandy, please! i can't take it anymore. what a bunch of parasites! i'm telling the boss of the boss of it all. the way you're wasting his money. you disgust me! you've found a crack. he is extremely corny, to put it mildly. so you need corny theater. you haven't been aiming low enough. living-room realism, sentimentality... and cliches. cliches, cliches. (knocks on door) are you coming? it's time. come on. - why are you at the meeting? - (broken danish) because boss of it all... because the boss of it all said so, yes. (speaks icelandic) we'll be in our cars five minutes from now. (speaks icelandic) - do we agree this time? -yes. (speaks icelandic) - on the price and terms? -yes. (speaks icelandic) - let's just sign. -yes. and because everything is settled, allow me to send a message... (translates into icelandic) these dates are all wrong. how embarrassing! i'll correct them. sorry. ...a message. at aunt titty and uncle carl's wedding anniversary... a collection was made in an old sock. but here we've been collecting every single day for ten years. right here. the day came for aunt titty and uncle carl, as it will for us, when the party is over. we wake up one morning and put out our hands... ...and all we grasp is thin air. (man translates into icelandic) and you, and me, and the two of us, these three people are but a saga. (man translates) you, who were once my very life, and i, who was once yours, shall never again hold hands. and to whom is this message addressed? the man who is always the first to curse himself for his mistakes, but the first to forgive us ours. - who do i mean? - ravn... - louder! - ravn. you carried us in your heart, ravn. you brought us together. you gave generously of your love. and now you're going away... like bubbles in the bay. on your way to greater deeds. but one thing we promise. whether begging or biting, near or far, your home will always be in our hearts, in this green and pleasant land. always. you were always there for us. but, dammit, who was there for you? and know this, as the swallow twittered beneath the eaves, this is not adieu, but au revoir! (applause) (speaks icelandic) thanks for your words. may they be the last. (finnur speaks icelandic) thanks for sentimentality so nauseating that no living creature could possibly take it seriously. do you have something to say, mr. ravn? is there anything we have overlooked? (ravn sniffs) do tell us, mr. ravn. i'm the boss of it all. i own the company. i make the decisions. gorm is right. he is right. autumn is muggy. real muggy. gaggingly muggy. i'm sorry. i'm sorry. thank you, ravn. was it really so hard to say? i always knew you were the boss. you'd have to be stupid not to see that. i forgive you, ravn. come on. on your feet... upsy-daisy. all the way. (speaks icelandic) what about that signature? - are you going to sell, or what? - (ravn) urn... that might be tricky. how can kristoffer sell what's never been his? no, mr. sigurdsson, there will be no sale. the company is more strongly united than ever. and more so, when i've put right a few sins of the past. i have some offshoring to see to. outsourcing! the word is outsourcing. you said offshoring. it's outsourcing. what you're doing right now is what irritates me the most. you're forgetting the actor. you're right. sorry. kristoffer deserves the credit for making me confess. - everything's due to you. - that's all very well. but that's not how it works. you don't just jump from hell to happily-ever-after. there are certain formalities that have to be kept. you're right! let's annul these fucking contracts right now. and now you just waive the power of attorney to sell the firm. -no. - what? no. no, no, no. there are binding commitments you can't annul by the stroke of a pen. we are no longer interested in a deal since it's clear that the man with the pen is not the company's legal owner. from his reading of the sagas my client knows that he who deals with stooges deals with nobody. our client just remembered some new scriptures that indicate a more modern interpretation. more appropriately rendered: ""he who deals with a man without power of attorney deals with nobody."" as our client sees it, the man with the pen is indeed furnished with power of attorney, and that's fine with him. what's going on, kristoffer? it worked out like you wanted. yeah, more or less. - you're not thinking of signing! - it's beyond me. i'm an actor. whether i sign or not is up to my character. i'll have to ask him. but your character is to blame for all this. it's probably just a formality. i need space to consult my character. after all, he is the boss of it all. what's going on? he's being contrary. he's an actor. he couldn't stand it when ravn got all the attention. he's just putting on a show, now that everyone is looking at him. i hope... no! hang on a moment. i can't make final contact. i seem to hear the boss saying something. and then it might be the opposite. silence in the back! shh! you have to breathe life into your material. what are your character's moral values? it's fascinating. and let me be completely frank... i haven't the slightest clue. there are sympathies and antipathies, trying to cancel each other out. i'll just listen some more. i got it. close call, but the sympathy meter needle just managed to sway in favor of ravn and his staff. (shouts in icelandic) you shitty, shitty, shit-faced danes. with all your damned chatter. you gave us 400 years of torment. is the idiot going to sign or not? i abhor the danish race. what was the last thing? he said the whole business was absurd. as absurd as... gambini. gambini? antonio stavro gambini? the hanged cat. one act, 1969. some say late 1968. oh, shit. forget it. it's gambini. the chimney sweep's monologue. (man) and so we reached, on the verge of giving up, the end of our comedy. like you, i would like to get home, but i'd like to apologize to those who wanted more and those who wanted less. those who got what they came for... deserve it"
Von Trier,The House That Jack Built,"may i ask you something? i can't promise i'll answer. r... right, that's exactly what i meant. um, are you allowed to speak along the way? i was thinking there might be rules. let me put it this way very few make it all the way without uttering a word. people are overcome with a strange and sudden need to confess on these trips. and not all of it can be said to be of great rhetorical quality but do carry on merrily just don't believe you're going to tell me something i haven't heard before. i will tentatively divide my tale into 5 randomly chosen incidents over a 12-year period. so i'm standing here holding this jack crap's not working. do you, uh, do you have a jack i could borrow? no, i'm sorry. - no? - no - no? - no that's odd, i thought everyone had a jack. i don't. perhaps you could have a look at my car? well, i don't have to have a look at your car. the issue with your jack is it's broken. there. so, uh, what's a person like me supposed to do? well, i suppose i could, uh, drive over to sonny's repair shop and call for roadside assistance. it's about, uh, 5 miles from here. what kind of repair shop is it? it's... it's.. sonny's a blacksmith, very good one. blacksmith. well, maybe this sonny can repair the jack? you'd have to talk to sonny about that. perhaps, i could entice you to drive me there? - please. - um.. oops, that was a mistake. mistake? me getting in this car with you. what was it one's mother used to say about not getting into cars with strangers? well.. i wouldn't know what your mother said. you might as well be a serial killer. i'm sorry but you do kind of look like one. you'd like me to drive you back to your car? no, no. i can take care of myself. i'm sorry, were you offended that i called you a serial killer? no. it's of absolutely no importance to me. maybe it's just the van. it's the kind one might expect to be kidnapped in or used to transport corpses. but if you really were a serial killer i guess the easiest thing would be just to bury my body back up there by those trees but you'd have to remember to dig 6 feet down so the foxes couldn't dig up my grave. what would i do? what would i do to keep you from getting away with it? of course, i'd just pick up that jack and hit you over the head with it. a jack like that can do quite a bit of damage don't you think? i'm not a medical examiner. it'd do quite a lot of damage. don't forget this. good luck with sonny. um, would it be too much to ask for you to drive me back? if this sonny is as fast as you say he is? i'm sure sonny is perfectly capable of giving you a lift back to your.. as... as i told you before, i don't like driving with strangers. well, i'm just as much of a stranger as sonny is. oh, getting along just fine. i'll just go speak to sonny, just take a moment. sonny. hi, jack. how's it going? well, i was working on miller's tractor but this lady is being really persistent. you don't say. big mistake. the reason serial killers can roam around free in our country is that they have no connection between themselves and their victims. so, you just made a big mistake letting sonny see the two of us together. you know.. ...honestly, i have more important things to be doing with my life than messing around with this crap. you... you said he was really good. yeah, well, i'm sure sonny was just distracted by your goddamned blabbering. now i have to go, i have an appointment. appointment, what appointment? that's none of your goddamn business now, is it? you're not just gonna leave me here. in fact, yes, that is kind of what i was thinking. i'm sure there will be another serial killer passing by who can give you a lift back to sonny's. that is, unless he decides to kill you first. even if i was to beg you to drive me back? just a last time? pretty please. you know, i take it all back what i said earlier about you looking like a serial killer. no, no, no, you don't have the disposition for that sort of thing. you're way too much of a wimp to murder anyone. oh, dear, you are a dangerous man smacked her with a jack, did you? honestly, i've heard of more murders than i can count. and by the way, what does this ridiculous man have to do with anything? it's glenn gould one of the greatest piano players of our time. he represents art. so a jack in the face of an admittedly unbearable lady was great art. is that what i'm to make of it? dear mr. verge, please give me a chance to cast some supplemental light on the story of the jack. the old cathedrals often have sublime artworks hidden away in the darkest corners for only god to see or whatever one feels like calling the great architect behind it all. the same goes for murder. when i say cathedrals it is first and foremost the gothic buildings we admire. here elegant, pointed arches have replaced the earlier more primitive rounded arches. the art of engineering is first and foremost about statics that is so things remain standing in spite of the various forces that impact the buildings. in this way, the pointed arch created a possibility to build much higher and with much more light but most importantly with less use of material. i often say that the material does the work. in other words it has a kind of will of its own and by following it, the result will be the most exquisite. so the material was the jack and it jumped into the lady's face on its own. art is many things. very convenient and unusual in the pile of bad excuses. but all of that is of no interest whatsoever unless you're an engineer. i am an engineer. my mother was of the opinion that becoming an engineer was the more financially viable choice but my really big dream was to become an architect. right before the lady and the jack i purchased a building lot and since i was my own developer due to a substantial inheritance no one could keep me from drawing up my own plans for my own house. engineer or architect what i see is an ocd patient in full bloom. ordnungszwang jack to use a good german word. yes, perhaps, it is in any case true that i suffered from compulsions as a child. i was completely hysterical about cleaning and could never leave a room that wasn't perfectly neat and clean. a standard that was difficult to maintain in the walk-in freezer. the walk-in freezer? the walk-in freezer on prospect avenue. the sign has been broken for forever so no one really knew what the name of the street was. i bought the pizzas from the former owner of the walk-in freezer. he claimed it was a great deal but of course i never managed to sell them so it all became too much for me. i only ate one of those shitty pizzas. pizza, pizza! and then there was a door to another room which i never managed to open. a fucking neurotic riddled with obsessive compulsions and a pathetic dream of something greater. and what about the police? i imagine they started coming around a lot. no, call it luck if you will. i had attempted to hide her car.. ...but to my great annoyance you could still catch a glimpse of it from the main road. you know, without realizing where i had parked the car was a stroke of genius. you see, the small brook defines the state border and the local police, per definition can't see across state lines. it's not their jurisdiction. so i had no inquiries from the police. and by the way, i don't even know if sonny had told them about me. we met up quite a few times since but never spoke of it. hang on. hi. hi. who are you? police. did something happen? oh, no, no, no luckily nothing exactly has happened as of yet. i understand that you are fond of shopping at carlson's supermarket. why? did something happen at carlson's? no, uh, however we'd like to, uh, prevent things from happening to businesses in the vicinity like carlson's supermarket. yeah, may... may, may i come in? i'd like to see a police badge. so would i. unfortunately, that today is going to be a bit of a problem. now, ahem.. ...i can tell by your expression that you think it's a bad thing that i don't have my police badge on me. right. well, i'm here to tell you that it's a, it's a good thing.. ...for the police department and i'm not going to lie to you, okay? it also happens to be a good thing for me on a personal level. yeah. you see my... my badge it's, uh, at the silversmith. yeah, it's at the, the silversmith. they're... they're shining it up and, ah.. ...adding a few additional citations to it. i've been promoted. - okay. - right. so now you're.. now... now what are you? like, what's your, what's your rank now? we're not at liberty to discuss that. ah, that's considered classified information. however, i think this is safe to say that it's a considerable.. ...leap up the ladder. - uh, ahem, now may i... - no. not without a badge. bravo, bravo, bravo, that's excellent. that's exactly just the type of response we like to see. - you say no, that makes my day. - right. of course, everybody's always talking about security but what... what is actually anybody doing about it? no, is quite the correct answer. yeah, it's quite the correct answer indeed. of course you'll never allow somebody in your home just because they say, ""oh, i'm a police officer."" no. no, no, no. you don't do that. no. you wait until they show you the proper.. - badge. - yeah. the badge. - yup. - that's correct. yeah. um.. may i, uh, ask you a.. ...ah, somewhat personal question? um, when exactly was it that you lost your, your husband? it was just over 6 months ago that my husband passed.. where are you going with this? oh, i'm just thinking about your.. your pension, yeah. i bet with a simple phone call to one of my colleagues down in headquarters, i could get you a, ah.. ...considerable increase in your pension. i bet that i could, i could double what you're currently receiving. wait a minute. you could get me double my pension from the police department by calling people? uh, forgive me, uh, uh.. ...i, i've tricked you, a bit. in fact, as it, as it stands i'm not, i'm not a police officer. what? i'm an insurance agent, lady. the, the whole story that i told you about the badge that's, t-that's something that we've been asked to do by the authorities, it's, it's for statistical purposes or something. - hi, glenn. - hi, claire. - it's my friend glenn. - glenn. yeah, great guy. - you know glenn? - yeah, sure. uh, listen, are you interested in this, this increase, uh, the money? well, if you can double it. it won't take more than a few minutes of your time. alright, listen, you can come in. this damn door sticks. i mean, what the heck's the worst that could happen as long as you can double my pension. damn it. something wrong? this is so damn humiliating. you know being forced to, to stand out there exposed, time and time again have to be put in these situations i don't know why. listen, i'm sorry, uh, i-i.. i was jus.. you know how humiliating it is? i am constantly being put in these situations. it's just not fair. - no. - do you think it's fair? - no. - no. do you want me to get you a cup of tea? nah, nah, nah. don't worry about it. ow! fuck. ow! fuck. ah, fuck. fuck. the hell do you think you're going? oh, no. oh, no. here. put this under your head. i'm sorry. ow. i'm so sorry. oh.. what can i do to make this good again? - what can i do? - ugh! how can i help you? what can i do to make it better? - speak to me? - talk.. - can't talk? okay. - can't. hold on a second. i have something else i think you're gonna like quite a bit. do you like donuts? shh. have here.. here we go. yes, chamomile. it's good for you. jesus chri.. a murderer with ocd. it's almost ridiculous but how unfortunate for you, jack. and to top it off, with cleaning compulsions. shit. please get out of the car, sir. do you mind if i take a look in the van please, sir? - i'd be a bad guy if i said no. - alright, open her up, please. okay. i'm sorry, sir, but there's been a minor break-in down the street just now. i'd like to ask you a couple of questions about anything you may have seen or heard, yeah? glenn said you were visiting claire. i'm sorry y... you said something ab... about a break-in? - uh-huh. - well.. well, unfortunately i think you've got a more serious problem. claire, she's disappeared. clair miller has disappeared? yeah, i've been, uh, sitting out here for the last two hours in my van waiting for her. right. you see, ahem, i contacted claire because, uh, her late husband was a dear friend of mine. we worked together for number of years on the railroad and, uh, i'm a collector. yeah, i collect. uh, i collect trax. - trax? - old issues of trax. it's a, uh, publication owned by the railroad and, uh, jerry, uh i know, i happen to know for a fact that he also subscribed and was an enthusiast such as myself. so claire said she'd run inside and see if she could rustle up a couple of back issues for me. she didn't ask me in. right. better safe than sorry when an oddball like myself just turns up, right? - yeah. - yeah, yeah. so i knocked several times and, uh, she hasn't answered. okay. sir, i'm gonna ask you to stay right here. i'm just gonna go take a look. claire, it's ed. - maybe the door is open. - what? or maybe not. claire, you here? claire? - is she up there? - no, she's not up there. maybe she went out through the back. i, i think i would have noticed that. uh, this is really, really strange. if you ask me, i'd say that this needs to be thoroughly investigated. right, well i'm not askin' you. you know, i have to say, also, that i heard uh, some noises coming from... the living room. - noises? - yeah, some noises. i, i, of course, i can't be sure but it sounded a little bit like a.. like a scuffle of some kind. scuffle? no, no, no. you're gonna have to put that back down, now. sir, that kind of investigation, that's for police, don't. right, right. sir, i'm gonna have to ask you to leave the house. - i'm sorry? - sir, now! - okay. - mm-hm. you know, i'm gonna do so under protest. i, i feel like that my observations well, they could be of use in an investigation. as a tax-paying citizen, someone who is fully aware of my constitutional rights. what? o... officer, please allow me to finish i'm just trying to be of assistance, okay? you've got one minute, sir. i would like to recommend one thing and it's within my right, that this room is inspected impeccably. with a magnifying glass if you catch my drift. - get out. - have a nice day, officer. get out, sir. don't the police officers in your story seem exceptionally naive? is that the point? no, but here it comes, the point that is. i can hardly wait. the great rain! it washed away the long track from my escape. now, i don't consider myself a decidedly devoted man of faith. which, of course, is a totally crazy thing to say considering our present situation but i must admit.. ...i experienced the rain, the fiercest i have ever seen as a kind of a blessing. and the murder as a kind of liberation. i felt i had a higher protector. and in the reality you were just a terrifying perverted satan. but, did you understand, or even better, did you accept the connection to your own personality? that you yourself were a psychopath? well, i'm not stupid. that's rather unusual. the psychopath will never accept his own diagnosis. but i did! for instance, the psychopath's lack of empathy. i went to great lengths to fake normal empathy.. ...in order to hide amongst the masses. smile. oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. disappointed. very, very disappointed. and the reeds? i was a very sensitive child.. ...profoundly afraid of playing. for example, hide and seek. in the case of hide i always chose to run in near panic into a field of reeds to hide. i see something other than a scared kid. i see a kid with a more mysterious goal. the choice of the dash through the reeds was an escape but also an open invitation to the pursuer because of the clear path of broken reeds left behind. was there an element of come and catch me in you as a child? or perhaps, more importantly in you as a person? was there never a tiny grain of disappointment about the great rain that washed away your tracks so you couldn't be caught? more like amazement.. ...when i think about all the things i've done in my life without it, in any way, resulting in punishment. i loved when the men from the village cut the meadows with their scythes. back then one spoke of the breath of the meadow. everyone working in rhythm exhaling when they mowed, and inhaling when they pulled the scythes back. it was as if the meadow lived at its fullest in my consciousness.. ...when i listened to its breath. stop that. stop it. stop it! stop it! experience had taught me how to strangle correctly and for long enough. bravo, jack! you certainly are clever and tough.. ...just like all the other criminals. the fact is, when, after several more murders i felt my ocd diminish i started to take greater chances. this time i was completely dissatisfied with the pictures so i decided to take new ones. fuck. fuck! fuck it! shit! it struck me like lightning from a clear sky. fuck! i couldn't resist running that little old lady over. it made my already rather daring plan of bringing the first body back to the scene of the murder in order to take some more inspired photos a great deal more dangerous. i now had a severely hemorrhaging body and another body in a bizarre, frozen position on my hands. goddammit! could you elaborate a little on why the old lady had to die? i can't explain it all, but perhaps i can describe it as the kind of blood frenzy an ermine experiences in a hen house. do you know blake's poems.. ...about the lamb and the tiger? i do know blake superficially but i'm afraid i won't escape a comprehensive tutorial. god created both the lamb and the tiger. the lamb represents innocence and the tiger represents savagery. both parts are perfect and necessary. the tiger lives on blood and murder kills the lamb.. ...and that is also the artist's nature. you read blake like the devil reads the bible. after all, the poor lamb didn't ask to die in order to become even the greatest art. the lamb has been bestowed with the honor of living forever in art, and art is divine. but still the same red van. now all bloody. somewhat reckless, i should think if you don't want to be found out. now, that's exactly what i thought.. ...but i didn't have the strength to change it and besides, everything was still going remarkably well. sometimes the best way to hide is to not hide at all. but now, as i said, the ocd was on decline.. ...so i took deliberate risks and didn't remove the blood from either the bedroom or the car. it was actually quite liberating to reach that point. it turned out the little old lady who was merely an accident added a great touch of humor to my staged photographs. and i was very pleased with the outcome. sophistication. mr. sophistication? of course! your narcissism knows no bounds. i sent the picture to the local paper which usually distinguished itself by running stories about missing, not to say, uh, stolen garden gates and so, might do well with a story with a, you know little more bite. for me though, what was really sensational about the work with the photo, it wasn't the image but the negative. when i was 10 years old, i discovered that through the negative, you could see the real inner demonic quality of the light. the dark light. but what about repentance, jack? the ones i deal with tend to repent all over the place. i repent nothing no matter how long we have to walk but i did think of something the other day. imagine a man walking down a street underneath the street lamps. right under a light his shadow is the densest but also the tiniest. then when he starts to move his shadow grows in front of him. the shadow becomes bigger and bigger while it thins out and the shadow behind him from the next lamppost emerges and becomes shorter and shorter until it reaches its ultimate density as the man stands directly underneath the light. let's say that the man standing underneath the first lamppost is me when i've just committed a murder. i feel strong and content. i start to walk and the shadow in front of me grows bigger like my pleasure, but at the same time pain is on its way, represented by the shadow behind me from the next lamppost and at the midpoint between the lampposts the pain is so great it outweighs my pleasure. and with every step forward pleasure dissolves and pain intensifies behind me. finally the pain is so unbearably intense that i have to act, so when i reach the point with the next lamp in zenith i will kill again. i know you want to be someone special, jack but let's face it, this illustration can be used for any addict's tale of woe. the alcoholic empties the bottle at the zenith et cetera, et cetera. but what about the family? i understand that your occupation didn't leave any room for a family in your life. no, why? well, it could be, despite everything that speculating about this might have triggered just a tiny bit of human feeling. for example, a variation on what those of us less clever might call need. need? because i never had a family? no, i can't say that it did. but the concept of family actually inspired one of my greatest works. okay, hats for everyone you are to keep your hats on at all times. - thank you. - safety procedures. can we go up there, mom? of course we're gonna go up. smile, grumpy, it'll be fun. i don't think so. it's for your sake we've come all the way out here. i told you i didn't wanna go. you wanna see the weapons? this, george, is a rifle. this rifle has the capacity to hit its target at a distance of several 100 yards. and kill larger animals. have you killed any large animals? well, yes, i have. but that's not something that i'm proud of. if i'd killed some large animals i'd be proud of it. i guess that's where you and i differ, georgie. this here is a shotgun. it's what they call a smoothbore weapon. this is not as precise as the rifle but it's more effective when the animal is closer and moving. you can touch it if you want. can i? yeah. are we going hunting? no. hunting is such an unpleasant thing. i used to hunt quite a bit, but i've stopped. why? to be honest, i find hunting distasteful. for example, if i wanted to shoot some of the crows up in that tree, we'd be talking about what is known as culling, which quite simply means you want to determine which animals you are going to allow to live in your forest. the crow has no value as prey but can be culled because they are seen as something of a threat to animals you wanna cultivate. culling, it's also such an unpleasant word. it has a tinge of ethnic cleansing about it. the very sick and twisted act of hunting has been ritualized to such an unsettling degree. the battue, for example where a row of beaters scares the living daylight out of an entire forest. not to mention the trophy parade, practiced primarily in europe at the end of the hunt as a final insult in which each species has its own traditional place. we want to go up in the tower, mom. shh. george, wait. yep, we are going up. okay, george, you want to shoot? i'll aim.. ...you pull the trigger. fire! excellent! to fell an animal of this size you have to be sure to hit it in the vitals which is to say here, in the area of the lungs. as you can see, this one was hit here in the hind quarter. an animal could run a great distance with an injury such as this. that's why typically a good hunter would have a schweiss-dog, that's trained in following a blood trail so you can track the animal down and finish the job. schweiss, well, that's the word we use for blood trail. congratulations, young georgie, you hit the animal. so you had found yourself a family? yes, that's also how i like to see it. but it's all so much simpler with animals. what do you mean? the order is important. the hind will typically run in the front with the largest fawn following the smallest last. you'd typically shoot at the deer starting with the rear one based on the fact that the two older animals can survive without the young one whereas, if you shot the mother first and didn't get the others both fawns would probably not survive. so in this manner, you then shoot the bigger fawn and then the mother last. stay down! stop! george! george! my family was moving in the wrong order. i have always taken ethical hunting rules very seriously. on that point, i think of myself as a bit of a gentleman. a gentleman, really? hmm. or a mr. sophistication even? no! no! no! george doesn't seem to have much of an appetite. perhaps he'd like some of that pie. you know, when i was a boy, i never got enough pie. why don't you do as i say.. ...and give the youngster a little piece of pie? it's if have no say in the matter. this was supposed to be an enjoyable picnic. this has been a good day. an excellent day. do you have a favorite number? any number? everybody has a favorite number. 12. 12. that's an excellent number. very good number indeed. picnic's over. you can go ahead. i'll take care of the kids. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. schweiss. exactly. do you expect me to praise you or applaud? you know, i'm sad that you're so judgmental, verge. don't look at the acts, look at the works. the whole notion of trophies. no. no, no, no! you're constantly trying to manipulate me. and with children the most sensitive subject of all. i'm also sensitive, verge. i cannot sleep on a sheet with even the smallest wrinkle. the hunt, after all, is a metaphor for love. and that is your weakness, jack. so much has happened during those days let's call it signs in the sun and the moon which claimed my presence for yet another work of art and roused my aggression. first, the eclipse. then the volcanic eruption of mount st. helens which i could see from my lot. i had just then decided that using cinder blocks was totally, totally wrong. so i decided to change the material. the divine material. love, jack. love is also an art. not to mention intimacy. the iceman always inhaled his victims' last breath. jack! not your brain it's just the flame that burns your change to keep you  verge? i'm here, jack. i don't feel so good, verge. there's a sour taste in my mouth. you want me to show you the way to the next whiskey bar? it's the acid you are starting to taste. it appears at this depth. i'm afraid you are going to have to get used to it. i placed grumpy in the anteroom.. ...and left him there until rigor mortis had disappeared. i had a plan for little grumpy. what does that mean? those who are really good at taxidermy can make the animals look alive by changing their expressions and positions so it becomes a whole little scene. i discovered that if i worked around rigor mortis and worked before the corpses froze then i could manipulate their expressions and positions with steel wire, pins, tape and things like that. and then when they were frozen remove it all and have a nearly credible human being. grumpy was grumpy no more. was that what you were after? a completely credible human being? without becoming too romantic, might one say that exactly that is reminiscent of a kind of desire for love? i had a romance. where did the crutch come from, jack? you hadn't hurt yourself, had you? a very useful little trick if you wish to look harmless. in general, if you carry some luggage and a crutch people come running to assist and then you force them into the car with a weapon. what does that have to do with love? i really had strong feelings for this one much stronger than a psychopath should be able to have. smile. hey. talk to me. i can't. i hate the way you look at me. the way i look at you? okay. can you tell me what's on your mind now? i just don't know where i've got you. are you trying to leave me? i feel like you're trying to leave me. i'm not going to leave you. i'm right here. you feel that? i'm right here, on the other end of the line. hang up for a second. - hello. - who am i speaking with? you know who you are speaking with. you know i'd never leave you. now what do you say? don't you think we deserve a drink? sure. i'll be over shortly for cocktails. i went down  simple? you know i hate it when you call me simple. my name is jacqueline. jacqueline? did old mr. and mrs. simple really have that vivid an imagination? jacqueline.. i bet they got that right out of ""the new york times"" crossword puzzle. to me, your name is simple, simple. hey, you've got great tits. why do you always have to be so crude? what.. is that being crude? i don't think i was being crude. have you figured out the difference between lions and tigers? tigers have stripes. and where do they live? africa? and the difference between an architect and an engineer? architect draws houses? and an engineer? also draws houses? you call that a difference? an engineer reads music, an architect plays music if that's something your limited brain can process. why do you always have to be so cruel? i'm not completely stupid. that fucking depends on your definition of ""completely."" can we just talk about something normal? - like.. - like? what you do, something like that? information about what i do. in simple terms that a simpleton can understand is that right, simple? yes. i kill. okay. i've killed 60 people. i'm a serial killer, simple. you're weird. i'm weird? why, because i'm saying that i've killed 61 people? you said 60 before. if you weren't as dumb as a fucking doorknob you would be familiar with the term ""updated."" just because the number was 60 an hour ago doesn't mean that it can't easily become 61 in just a couple of minutes. well, i'm not dumb as a doorknob. maybe i haven't read as many books as you. simple, come on. you're as dumb as fuck. now why don't you be a good little dreamboat and go get me a magic marker. could you bring me a magic marker? red or black? e... either one's fine. you're fucking weird. excuse me. - officer. - yeah. my friend is, like, totally weird and he said he killed 60 people or maybe even 61. have you been drinking? um, yeah. then stop. everything that this woman has said.. ...is true. i have killed 60 people! 60 people! i'm a serial killer. please help me. i've also been a horrible human being.. ...to this woman right here.. ...ms. jacqueline. miss, would you be kind enough to sweep up your friend here and take him back inside? i can't order you both to stop drinking but i would recommend it. i can never make it up to you. never be able to make it up to you. can you forgive me? yeah. i forgive you. come on. let's go inside. you need some pills. i've got a friend who's got some good pills. are you leaving? i was just gonna go get some pills. do you have my... my keys? i'm not gonna take some random pills. you know, i really think i deserve better than this. i'm gonna hang on to the keys. it's a bad habit for you to go rushing downstairs every time we start to have, have a good time. right? you're walking without your crutch. and you weren't using it downstairs either. you're mr. sophistication, aren't you? if you feel like screaming.. ...i definitely think that you should. you call that screaming? help! help! help! yes, help! there's a murderer in the building! it's mr. sophistication! help! help! shh! shh! hey. hey. hey. shh! do you hear? do you hear anything? do you hear anybody running downstairs to help? some neighbors you have. you want to try the window? i just want my keys. i just want my keys. i want my keys. help! help! help me! please help me! you know, maybe i'm mistaken, but.. ...as far as i can tell.. ...not a single light has gone on in any apartment or stairwell. you know why that is? 'cause in this hell of a town.. ...in this hell of a country.. ...in this hell of a world, nobody wants to help! you can scream.. ...from now until christmas eve and the only answer you'll get is the deafening silence that you're hearing right now. can't we talk? there's a time for talking and a time for being quiet. open your mouth. open your mouth! okay, simple. oh, i'm sorry, ms. jacqueline. now, it's time.. ...for you to choose a knife. all you have to do is nod. no? what about this one? you don't like that one either? okay. how about this one? hmm. well.. ...that's an interesting choice, simple. you know.. ...there is something that has been bothering mr. sophistication.. ...for quite a bit. and perhaps it's more interesting to him.. ...than it would be to you. but to be honest he gets pretty fuckin' pissed when he thinks about it. why is it always the man's fault? no matter where you go it's like you're some sort of wandering guilty person. without even having harmed a single kitten. i actually get sad when i think about it. if one is so unfortunate.. ...as to have been born male.. ...then you're also born guilty. think of the injustice in that. women are always the victims, right? and men, they are always the criminals. told you before, this is private property. i want you to leave. all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put simple back together again. why are they always so stupid? who's stupid? all the women you kill strike me as seriously unintelligent. come on. i've also killed men. but you only talk about the stupid women unless you think all women are stupid. well, the stories i've told were selected at random, but... you feel superior to women and want to brag? it turns you on, doesn't it, jack? no, no, but women are easier. not physically, they're just easier to work with. more cooperative. to kill, you mean. if you like. mr. sophistication believes in that theory. so, mr. sophistication is, uh, the theoretician? i can tell you're lapping it up when i tell you about mr. sophistication. ""so jack hears voices ""that order him to do this or do that. jack must be psychotic."" i loathe diagnosis you can just write down in letters. that's not fair, the letters are clear. they look after us and create boundaries between good and evil, and they carry religion. religion has ruined human beings because your god teaches people to deny the tiger in themselves and turns us all into a throng of slaves too shameful to acknowledge it. oh, jack, you should have read the right letters in your life but you didn't want to. the collection of corpses were mostly frozen shortly after death however, i think a handful of them, by chance had reached, uh, at least, a certain degree of putrefaction before i managed to get them on ice. can you say if putrefaction is good or evil? most people would say, it's the natural breakdown which, in the end, is a reaction of matter which is the basis for life on earth. thereby, it's neither particularly good nor evil and that a human being must be perceived as alive if you're to describe that person's qualities and identify that person's ultimate goal. but this is where mr. sophistication has a very different opinion. he argues quite well that the ultimate goal for the human being is not prior to death but after. you reduce everything human to matter and that way life disappears and along with it art which you value so highly. verge, you're a bitter old bastard. you kill art by imposing your moral ruler on life which i want to free because art is so immeasurably vaster than we will ever understand. may i illustrate now? there is no avoiding it, is there? i don't have a handle on how many processes take part in the decay of a dead human but i know a bit about dessert wines. in order to achieve the most sublime sweetness and the greatest wines, nature has provided us with various methods. the 3 most common forms of decomposition are frost.. ...dehydration.. ...and a fungus with the enticingly mysterious name, the noble rot. the first method is the one that in germany is used to produce ""eiswein."" the method quite simply entails leaving the grapes on the vine for so long that they are exposed to frost for a certain number of nights before they are pressed. this method increases the sugar content in the wine dramatically. it is very risky, as the grapes must have certain qualities in order to be able to withstand the process. on top of that, there can be uncertainty about whether or not the first night's frost lives up precisely to the expectations, et cetera. the second method is called ""trockenbeeren"" in which the grapes are allowed to hang on the vine until they dry up and very nearly become raisins. the last method, which, for example is essential for the production of sauternes is a kind of mold that causes grapes to be very full-bodied and have an explosively high sugar content. you could say about all three processes that it's the breakdown that lifts the living grape up to be a part of an artwork. you can view the processes that start in a human being after death in the same manner. says you! and i still say that without love there is no art. it's not up for debate. the thing you are talking about with the grapes is just nature's method of decomposing. if decomposition is a way to salvation then what about your house? by god, you cannot convince me that the idea of your first house being torn down was, in any way, satisfying. do you claim that it was built to be torn down? no, of course it wasn't ideal and i'm sorry to say that it happened no less than three more times that i started construction and then became doubtful. it was difficult to create the house that i had dreamed of. the material didn't do what i wanted it to do. the houses i had drawn had already at the very first detail, something banal not to say ordinary, about them isn't that what in art you would call epigonism? your great talent only reached so far you, artist of all times. when you were writing, didn't you yourself plan the destruction of your most popular literary work? ""the aeneid"" was a commissioned work where the ruling power and its ideas were glorified by me to the point where it was no longer art. but if glorification could demean a work.. ...why should destruction and demolition not be able to do the opposite and create art? albert speer invented ""the theory of ruin value"" by examining the greek and roman ruins and constructed his buildings using both weaker and stronger materials so that they, in a thousand years, would appear as aesthetically perfect ruins. which fortunately were smashed to atoms in mere few years after their construction. hubris is punished by nemesis if i may use an old-fashioned expression. but an artist must be cynical and not worry about the welfare of humans or gods in his art. this talk about the value of ruins makes it too obvious, not to mention, another subject. the value of icons. the stuka without a doubt the world's most beautiful airplane and to top it off featuring an eerily sophisticated detail. i'm sure you know what i'm talking about. no, by god that has never interested me but do tell me about it. the stuka was a dive-bomber. they say that the pilots actually passed out for a brief moment during the actual dive. but the detail per favore. fantastic. incomparable. notice the sound when the plane dives. the screeching sound. a result of poor design if you ask me. poor design, please. on the contrary, the screeching was intrinsic sirens were attached to the undercarriage of the plane purposely designed as a psychological act of war. no one who heard it in action will ever forget that sound. it made the blood run cold in everyone's veins. known as jericho's trumpet. sadistic, but in your eyes probably a masterpiece. no, more than a masterpiece. an icon. the person or persons, who conceived the stuka and its functions, were icon-creators. what i'm getting at is this as disinclined as the world is to acknowledge the beauty of decay it's just as disinclined to give credit to those no credit to us who create the real icons of this planet. we are deemed the ultimate evil. all the icons that have had and always will have an impact on the world are for me extravagant art. the noble rot. stop it... you antichrist! i don't recall ever having escorted a so thoroughly depraved person as you, jack. since you have now apparently set your heart in mass extermination let me make a brief comment about the buchenwald camp that emphasizes my attitude towards art and love. in the middle of this concentration camp stood a tree and not just any old tree, but an oak and not just any oak, but the one goethe when he was young, sat beneath and wrote some of humanity's most important works. goethe. here you can talk about masterpieces and the value of icons. the personification of humanism, dignity culture and goodness was by the irony of faith suddenly present in the middle of one of the all time greatest crimes against humanity. some people claim that the atrocities we commit in our fiction are those inner desires which we cannot commit in our controlled civilization. so they are expressed instead through our art. i don't agree. i believe heaven and hell are one and the same. the soul belongs to heaven and the body to hell. the soul is reason and the body is all the dangerous things for example art and icons. let me finish with a curiosity. i've always considered it ridiculous when i've heard about the serial killer's favorite trophy. here you are, jack. and yet i let myself be tempted to not let simple's other breast go to waste but have it prepared and sown. also a small icon. thank you, sir. do you wanna fucking die? - no. - then do what i fucking say. do what i say! unlock it. drop the keys. turn around. cuff. cuff! kneel down. we're freezing. one of the others fainted earlier. we're dying of cold. we're dying. really? ""we're freezing."" i guess i owe you gentlemen an explanation. during world war ii on the eastern front german soldiers had large programs of executions but were in short supply of ammunition so they experimented with the execution of several individuals with one, just one single bullet. now as a tribute to that, uh, ingenuity.. ...i'm going to conduct a small experiment of my own. i'm going to use.. ...a full metal jacket bullet which has the capacity to pass through each and every one of your heads. that's not something that i would be able to do with basic hunting ammunition. wait, wait, wait, wait, sir, sir. i... it's a misunderstanding, sir. - i hear that a lot. - no, sir. w... what i mean is that you are wrong about the ammunition, sir. that is not full metal ammunition, sir. i'm a military man, and i know, sir. fuck. you're right! this is a hunting round. this box, it's... it's completely mislabeled. goddammit! forgive me, gentlemen, i'm gonna have to, uh step out for a moment. i know it's not an ideal situation. don't die on me guys, okay? i've never yelled at you before, al but i'm about to now. what does that look like to you, what does that say there? uh, 30 odd 6.. - 30 odd 6, that's correct. - yeah. it also says full metal jacket. and when i look inside.. get me a goddamn box, al, and this time make sure it's got full metal jacket bullets in it! is it too much to fucking ask that the contents of the box match what's written on the label? i can, i can see that the, you're right the label doesn't quite match the.. ...uh, content. - w... well, that's correct. - yeah, but.. the thing is that what i can't see is that the... the.. ...the box was bought here in the shop. uh.. well i buy all my shit here. i have, for 20 years. i'm in here almost every other week. what's wrong with you, al? i'm sorry, i need to see a receipt. - receipt? - yeah well, i don't have a fuckin' receipt. i don't ever recall getting a receipt here. now i'm in a fucking hurry. let me buy a new box. but this time make sure it contains full metal jacket bullets. okay, uh, c... can i just see some id first? don't fucking do this, al. the thing is, the... the law requires that i have... how about this.. no doubt about your... your identity... sell me just one full metal jacket bullet. can i, can i just ask.. ...why just... one? well, that will be none of your fuckin' business. - that... that's right. i'm sor... - okay? i do business here because you don't ask stupid questions. i'm... i'm sorry, jack. i'm... i'm sorry. - shut it down, al, go home, have a sandwich. - okay. you've lost your fucking mind, al. yeah. i'm sorry. i'm so.. is it any wonder fuck you, al! is it any wonder you are too cool to fool? got to get a rain check on pain al's gone totally bonkers. i need a full metal jacket cartridge. yesterday, the police visited al and then me with lights and sirens to get you. it's over now, jack. what's over? they know what you've done. we.. alright, what have i done? the robbery. robbery? you guys better fucking get it together. i haven't robbed anybody. this is ridiculous. i'm gonna call the police, jack. give me your gun. i don't run around with guns on me. this is, this is crazy. sit yourself down, jack. this is s.p. i wanna get ahold of rob. well, when you get hold of him, you'll tell him to get over here straight away. i've caught jack. i'm kind of glad that you are the one that caught me. perhaps you don't know this.. ...but i think of you as my best friend. now that might not be a big deal to you.. ...but you've meant a great deal to me. it feels quite nice knowing that it's all over. somebody had to free me and stop me from stealing things that don't belong to me. and that someone turned out to be you. do you remember the time you took down that 8 pointer that i'd been tracking for 4 days? it was on my territory for sure. no one's questioning that. you've always been a great shot. now would you, uh, quit pointing that gun at me? kind of hurting my feelings a little bit. i'm not going anywhere. after all you know me, s.p. yeah. i know you. and you've never lied to me. no. just as fast as i always was, huh? you wouldn't make it to the door. what have i done? you got him, s.p. well, i'll take it from here. can we agree on this? is that a full metal jacket cartridge? yes, sir. that is.. that is a full metal jacket rifle cartridge. oh, please, please please, don't do this, please. - alright, come on. - don't do it, please! no, no. i can't focus. it's too close. perfect. jack! jack! who are you? call me verge. how did you get in here? what do you want? as i see it, it's you who called me. i've been with you for a while, you just didn't notice me. so, did you come here to stop me? i haven't come here to stop you from anything. i just have one question. what's the question? wasn't there something about you building a house? wasn't jack going to build a house? yes. i... i... i was.. ...trying.. ...but i didn't get very far. this is the police. come out with your hands where we can see them i can see it's going to be a bit difficult to get that house built, but perhaps another one. think, jack, after all you are an engineer and call yourself an architect. i've been told you have an interesting theory about the material which you claim has its own will. find the material, jack and let it do the work. your house is a fine little house, jack. it's absolutely usable. are you coming, jack? i'm here... jack. may i ask you something? i can't promise i'll answer. r... right, that is exactly what i meant. um, are you allowed to speak along the way? i was thinking there might be rules. put it this way very few make it all the way without uttering a word. people are overcome with a strange and sudden need to confess on these trips. and not all of it can be said to be of great rhetorical quality but do carry on merrily just don't believe you're going to tell me something i haven't heard before. do you hear a buzzing sound? yes. and i don't think you want to know where it's coming from. i wanna know everything. for thousands of years human beings have tried to localize hell. among other methods by seeking the sound it generates. one shouldn't focus on extracting screams and wailing because the cries of pain of so many millions of individuals together.. ...becomes what you have just heard. a buzzing sound whose intensity will increase as we get ever closer to the presence of suffering. verge? i'm here, jack. i don't feel so good, verge. there's a sour taste in my mouth. you want me to show you the way to the next whiskey bar? those are the elysian fields. we don't have access here. that's how deep the deepest hell goes. it's actually not here i'm to deliver you.. ...however improbable that may sound.. ...but a couple of circles higher up. i took you down here as a kind of a favor.. ...because you did after all give me a little to chew on with your story, and i understood that you wanted to see it all. when you are done looking, we'll turn back. where does that path lead? on the other side. it leads out of hell and up. as you can see there was once a bridge but that was before my time. isn't it possible to climb all the way around? this way.. ...and make it over to the other side? quite a few have tried, but i have to say.. ...never successfully. i wouldn't recommend it but the choice is entirely yours. i'll take my chance. bye, jack. bye, verge."
