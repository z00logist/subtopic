1
00:00:01,109 --> 00:00:04,196
MOSFILM

2
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:07,574
Fourth Artists' Association

3
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:20,462
What is your first name,
your last name?

4
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:29,846
My name is Yuri Zhary.

5
00:00:36,228 --> 00:00:38,522
Where did you come from?

6
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:44,444
I came from Kharkov.

7
00:00:56,915 --> 00:00:58,959
What school do you go to?

8
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:05,298
I go to a technical school.

9
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:12,347
Now we're going
to have a seance.

10
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:15,726
You just look at me.

11
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:22,691
Look me in the eye.

12
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:26,862
Look in front of you.

13
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,127
Turn around, with your back to me.

14
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:47,716
Concentrate on my hand.

15
00:01:47,924 --> 00:01:50,844
My hand is drawing you back.

16
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:09,237
Spread your hands.

17
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:20,040
Concentrate. All your tension
is centered in your hands.

18
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:27,130
Your hands are strained!

19
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:31,927
Concentrate all of your
will power,

20
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:34,429
your big desire to win,
on your hands.

21
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:40,018
Your hands are getting
more and more tense.

22
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,521
They're very tense.
Still more tense.

23
00:02:43,438 --> 00:02:50,070
Look at your fingers.
Your fingers are tense.

24
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,283
From here the tension passes on
to your fingers.

25
00:02:55,534 --> 00:03:00,247
Look at your hands.
Yura, concentrate!

26
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:06,586
On my count of three
your hands will become immobile.

27
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:15,303
One, two, three!
Your hands don't move.

28
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:17,639
You can't move them.

29
00:03:17,848 --> 00:03:21,184
You're trying to move your hands,
but they're fixed.

30
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:26,773
It's very hard for you
to make a slightest movement.

31
00:03:27,316 --> 00:03:29,359
Now I'm going to lift
this transfixion,

32
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:35,949
and you'll be able to speak
freely, easily and articulately.

33
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:43,874
From now on you will speak
loudly and clearly.

34
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,252
Look at me.

35
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:53,425
I'm lifting the tension
from your hands and your speech.

36
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:59,848
One, two, three!

37
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:04,394
Go ahead, say loudly and clearly:
I can speak!


56
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:17,569
The road from the station
passed through Ignatievo,

57
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:21,948
then swerved near the farm

58
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:24,785
we had lived on each summer
before the war,

59
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:29,247
and through a dense oak forest
went on as far as Tomshino.

60
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:34,086
Usually we spotted our people

61
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:38,006
as soon as they appeared from
behind a bush in the mid-field.

62
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:43,845
If he turned from the bush
towards our house, then it's father.

63
00:06:45,097 --> 00:06:48,684
If not, it meant it was not father

64
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:51,645
and that father would never come.

65
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:09,037
Am I going the right way
to Tomshino?

66
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:12,416
You shouldn't have taken a turn
at the bush.

67
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:17,004
And this What's this?
What?

68
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:20,590
Why are you sitting here?

69
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:24,511
I live here.
Where? On the fence?

70
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,849
Are you interested in the way to
Tomshino or where I live?

71
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:36,064
I brought all the instruments,
but forgot the key.

72
00:07:37,482 --> 00:07:41,361
Do you happen to have a nail
or a screw-driver?

73
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,906
I don't have any nails.

74
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:48,118
Why are you so nervous?

75
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,912
Give me your hand. I'm a doctor.

76
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:58,545
You're bothering me.

77
00:07:58,754 --> 00:08:00,797
Do you want me to call my husband?

78
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:08,305
You haven't got any husband.
There's no ring.

79
00:08:12,684 --> 00:08:17,481
Though people don't wear rings
nowadays. Maybe only old people.

80
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:26,448
May I have a cigarette?

81
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:45,842
Why do you look so sad?

82
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,729
And why do you look so happy?

83
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:01,733
It's a pleasure to fall down
with an attractive woman.

84
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:18,583
You know, I fell and found
strange things here   roots, bushes

85
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:23,171
Has it ever occurred to you

86
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:31,513
that plants can feel, know,
even comprehend

87
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:36,935
The trees, this hazel-nut bush

88
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:40,063
This is the alder-tree.
It doesn't matter.

89
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:43,191
They don't run about.

90
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:48,905
Like us who are rushing, fussing,
uttering banalities.

91
00:09:55,746 --> 00:10:00,709
That's because we don't trust
nature that is inside us.

92
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:06,631
Always this suspiciousness,
haste,

93
00:10:07,632 --> 00:10:10,302
and no time
to stop and think.

94
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,264
Look, you seem to be a bit

95
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:19,478
It's no problem for me.
I'm a doctor.

96
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:24,191
And what about "Ward Number Six"?

97
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:28,445
Oh, Chekhov had made it all up!

98
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:38,080
Come to Tomshino sometime.
We often have a good time there.

99
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:39,915
You've got blood!

100
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:44,419
Where?
Behind your ear.

101
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:48,025
Each moment of our dates, not many,

102
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:51,153
We celebrated as an Epiphany.

103
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:54,573
Alone in the whole world.

104
00:11:55,032 --> 00:12:00,662
More daring and lighter
than a bird

105
00:12:00,871 --> 00:12:03,415
Down the stairs, like a dizzy
apparition,

106
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:06,710
You came to take me on your road,
Through rain-soaked lilacs,

107
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:09,921
To your own possession,
To the looking glass world.

108
00:12:10,422 --> 00:12:12,466
As night descended

109
00:12:12,674 --> 00:12:15,052
I was blessed with grace,

110
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,970
The altar gate opened up,

111
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:20,015
And in the darkness shining

112
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:22,893
And slowly reclining
Was your body naked.

113
00:12:23,185 --> 00:12:26,730
On waking up I said:
God bless you!

114
00:12:26,938 --> 00:12:30,108
Although I knew how daring
and undue

115
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,986
My blessing was: You were fast
asleep,

116
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:35,906
Your closed eyelids
with the universal blue

117
00:12:36,114 --> 00:12:38,241
The lilac on the table
so strained to sweep.

118
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:41,119
Touched by the blue, your lids

119
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:44,790
Were quite serene, your hand was
warm.

120
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,877
And rivers pulsed in crystal slits,

121
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:52,339
Mountains smoked, and oceans
swarmed.

122
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:55,467
You held a sphere in your palm,

123
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:58,845
Of crystal; on your throne
you were sleeping calm.

124
00:12:59,262 --> 00:13:02,349
And, oh my God!  
Belonging only to me,

125
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:05,185
You woke and at once transformed

126
00:13:05,394 --> 00:13:08,063
The language humans speak and think.

127
00:13:08,438 --> 00:13:11,441
Speech rushed up sonorously formed,

128
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,195
With the word "you" so much
reformed

129
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:19,116
As to evolve a new sense meaning
king.

130
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:22,160
And suddenly all changed,
like in a trance,

131
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:25,455
Even trivial things,
so often used and tried,

132
00:13:25,664 --> 00:13:28,208
When standing 'tween us,
guarding us,

133
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:31,420
Was water, solid, stratified.

134
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:34,297
It carried us I don't know where.

135
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:37,342
Retreating before us, like some
mirage,

136
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:39,594
Were cities, miraculously fair.

137
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:43,015
Under our feet the mint grass spread,

138
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:45,517
The birds were following our tread,

139
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:48,812
The fishes came to a river bend,

140
00:13:49,021 --> 00:13:51,773
And to our eyes the sky was open.

141
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:55,402
Behind us our fate was groping,

142
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:58,905
Like an insane man with a razor
in his hand.

143
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:10,959
Oh, good heavens! Dounya!

144
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,672
What is it, Pasha?!

145
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,563
A fire! But be quiet.

146
00:14:46,912 --> 00:14:48,497
He'll get it coming to him!

147
00:14:48,747 --> 00:14:53,794
And what if Vitya is in there?
What if he's burned?

148
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:57,047
Where's Klanya?

149
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,928
What?

150
00:17:06,176 --> 00:17:07,386
Dad!

151
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:18,201
Alexei?
Hello, ma!

152
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,454
What's wrong with your voice?

153
00:20:20,996 --> 00:20:24,249
Nothing serious.
I guess it's just a sore throat.

154
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,836
I haven't spoken to anyone
for three days.

155
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,257
I even liked it. I think it's good
to keep silent for a while.

156
00:20:33,258 --> 00:20:35,302
Words can't express everything

157
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,556
a person feels.
Words are flaccid.

158
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:45,979
I just dreamed of you in my sleep.

159
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:48,065
As though I were still a child

160
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:53,278
By the way, what year was it
when dad left us?

161
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:59,201
1935. Why?

162
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:05,207
And the fire? Remember the hay-loft
that burned down at the farm?

163
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,502
That was in "35 too.

164
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:13,715
All right, stop pulling the wool
over my eyes.

165
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:17,511
You know Lisa died.

166
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:27,437
The one I worked in the printing
house with.

167
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:33,694
Oh God When?
This morning, at 7.

168
00:21:35,821 --> 00:21:40,450
And what time is it now?
What is now?

169
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:43,412
Almost six.
In the morning?

170
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:46,373
What's the matter with you?
In the evening.

171
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:51,837
Mom, why do we have to fight
all the time?

172
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:55,424
I'm sorry if I did anything wrong.

173
00:22:19,698 --> 00:22:23,327
Printing-house.
Next stop: Serpukhovskaya.

174
00:22:59,738 --> 00:23:01,782
What's the rush?

175
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:57,337
Hello.

176
00:23:59,297 --> 00:24:02,092
Where're the proofs
I've been reading?

177
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,805
I don't know. Just a minute.

178
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:13,562
Yelizaveta Pavlovna is here.

179
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:23,655
Marousia, what's wrong?

180
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:29,911
Something in yesterday's proofs?

181
00:24:30,662 --> 00:24:34,583
In the Goslit edition?
Don't be so nervous!

182
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,627
We should look in the typesetting
case.

183
00:24:39,338 --> 00:24:41,214
Nothing terrible has happened.

184
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:57,356
It's such an important edition!

185
00:25:01,943 --> 00:25:04,655
Although misprints have no place
in any edition.

186
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:07,366
Shut up, you idiot.

187
00:26:10,387 --> 00:26:13,056
What happened?
Nothing serious.

188
00:26:13,265 --> 00:26:18,603
I just want to check something.
I may be wrong

189
00:26:19,855 --> 00:26:21,898
Let's start from the beginning.

190
00:26:22,566 --> 00:26:24,776
I'd rather do it myself.

191
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:28,071
Everybody's rushing,
no one's got any time!

192
00:26:35,412 --> 00:26:37,039
You think I'm afraid?

193
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:39,833
No, let other people
be afraid.

194
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:43,628
Some people should work,
and others should be afraid.

195
00:27:02,814 --> 00:27:04,650
Well, nothing awful has happened.

196
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,778
If it happened, it happened.
We've been printing all night

197
00:28:22,728 --> 00:28:25,230
I waited for you since yesterday's
morning.

198
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:28,525
That you won't come they probably
guessed.

199
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,403
Remember what a beautiful weather
it was?

200
00:28:31,611 --> 00:28:34,781
A holiday weather!
And I walked coatless.

201
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,243
Today you're here, and they have
arranged

202
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:41,455
An utterly gloomy and cloudy day,

203
00:28:41,663 --> 00:28:44,750
It rains, and it's getting unusually
late,

204
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,754
The rain drops run down the cold
terrain,

205
00:28:49,504 --> 00:28:53,633
Unsoothable by word, unwipable
by hand

206
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:24,122
You see, it wasn't there, was it?
Everything is all right.

207
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:29,086
It wasn't
That would've been a horrid mistake.

208
00:29:29,294 --> 00:29:31,254
Why are you crying then?

209
00:29:32,756 --> 00:29:38,136
I even saw that word typeset.

210
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:39,596
What word?

211
00:29:58,573 --> 00:30:00,200
Great!

212
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:10,460
This is pure alcohol.
Not much, but it might help.

213
00:30:11,795 --> 00:30:15,215
You've got all drenched up.
You look like a scarecrow!

214
00:30:15,424 --> 00:30:18,885
Really, I'm all wet.

215
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:26,685
I guess I'll go and take a shower.
Where's my comb?

216
00:30:27,936 --> 00:30:31,315
You know who you resemble now?

217
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:35,485
Who?
Maria Timofeyevna.

218
00:30:35,694 --> 00:30:37,362
What Maria Timofeyevna?

219
00:30:40,032 --> 00:30:43,118
Here. You've been looking for
your comb, haven't you?

220
00:30:46,872 --> 00:30:49,541
Tell me, who's Maria Timofeyevna?

221
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:57,632
There was such a woman,
Captain Lebyadkin's sister.

222
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:03,430
You're the spitting image
of Lebyadkina.

223
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:07,976
In what way do I resemble her?

224
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,816
Yes, Fyodor Mikhailovich was
Whatever you may say

225
00:31:15,025 --> 00:31:16,568
What?

226
00:31:17,069 --> 00:31:20,113
Lebyadkin, bring some water!

227
00:31:20,364 --> 00:31:26,995
The difference is her brother would
not bring her water, but beat her.

228
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:30,207
Explain it. I don't understand.

229
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:35,337
All your life is just that
"bring some water!"

230
00:31:37,381 --> 00:31:39,424
Just an appearance of independence.

231
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:41,843
If something doesn't suit you,

232
00:31:42,052 --> 00:31:46,014
you pretend
it doesn't exist.

233
00:31:46,932 --> 00:31:49,059
What nonsense you're talking!

234
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:52,020
I'm amazed at the patience
of your ex-husband.

235
00:31:52,229 --> 00:31:56,441
He should have run away
much sooner.

236
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,276
What do you want from me?

237
00:31:58,485 --> 00:32:02,364
Have you ever admitted
you were wrong? Never!

238
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:07,119
You just made up
this whole situation!

239
00:32:08,745 --> 00:32:13,667
As long as you haven't succeeded
in elevating your dear husband

240
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:18,714
to this nonsensical emancipated
condition of yours,

241
00:32:18,922 --> 00:32:21,216
then you can be sure
he has been saved just in time.

242
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:26,596
As for your children, you will
definitely make them miserable.

243
00:32:37,316 --> 00:32:39,359
Stop this idiocy!

244
00:33:12,893 --> 00:33:16,647
Come on now, Masha!

245
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:22,486
Leave me alone!

246
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:31,411
My earthly life traversed but
by a half,

247
00:33:31,995 --> 00:33:34,831
I found myself lost in a twilight
forest

248
00:34:38,478 --> 00:34:44,067
I always said
that you resemble my mother.

249
00:34:44,276 --> 00:34:46,486
Apparently, that's the reason
we divorced.

250
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,992
I notice with horror how much
Ignat is becoming like you.

251
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,704
Why with horror?

252
00:34:55,912 --> 00:34:59,875
We two could never talk
like normal human beings.

253
00:35:03,211 --> 00:35:07,632
When I recall my childhood
and my mother,

254
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:11,970
somehow she always has your face.

255
00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:16,391
I know why though.

256
00:35:17,392 --> 00:35:21,938
I pity you both,
you and her.

257
00:35:22,147 --> 00:35:23,607
Why?

258
00:35:24,483 --> 00:35:27,069
Ignat, put the glass down!

259
00:35:34,409 --> 00:35:36,828
You won't be able to live
a normal life with anyone.

260
00:35:37,037 --> 00:35:38,789
Probably.

261
00:35:39,623 --> 00:35:44,711
Don't feel offended.
You seem to be convinced

262
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:48,882
that the very fact
of your existence close by

263
00:35:49,466 --> 00:35:51,510
will make everybody happy.

264
00:35:51,885 --> 00:35:53,512
You only know how to demand.

265
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:57,849
That's because I was brought up
by women.

266
00:35:58,642 --> 00:36:01,645
If you don't want Ignat
to become like that,

267
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:03,939
get married as soon as possible.

268
00:36:05,941 --> 00:36:08,610
Get married to whom?
This I don't know.

269
00:36:09,778 --> 00:36:11,822
Or give Ignat to me.

270
00:36:17,327 --> 00:36:21,039
Why didn't you make it up with
your mother? It was your fault.

271
00:36:21,498 --> 00:36:24,960
What fault?

272
00:36:26,294 --> 00:36:29,381
She's convinced herself she knows
better than I how I should live.

273
00:36:29,756 --> 00:36:32,759
That she can make me happy.

274
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:41,101
As far as mother is concerned,
I can feel it better than you.

275
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:44,229
What can you feel better?

276
00:36:44,438 --> 00:36:47,107
That we're getting more and more
distant,

277
00:36:47,858 --> 00:36:50,569
and I can't do anything
about it.

278
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:16,553
Natalya, try to distract him.
He's talking of Spain again.

279
00:37:16,762 --> 00:37:19,014
It will end up in a scandal.

280
00:37:23,894 --> 00:37:28,023
I wanted to ask you for a favor
We're redecorating now.

281
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:34,112
Ignat wants to live with you
for a week.

282
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:36,823
I will be very happy.

283
00:38:15,946 --> 00:38:17,572
What does he say?

284
00:38:17,781 --> 00:38:20,951
He's showing the great matador
Palomo Linares.

285
00:38:52,441 --> 00:38:54,860
Most of all he was excited
by the farewell he was given.

286
00:38:57,237 --> 00:39:00,157
The whole town came to see him off.
People sang and danced.

287
00:39:00,532 --> 00:39:03,285
His mother couldn't come,
she was sick.

288
00:39:04,161 --> 00:39:10,584
And his father stood aside,
sad and silent.

289
00:39:11,543 --> 00:39:15,672
He knew they were thinking
the same thing:

290
00:39:15,922 --> 00:39:18,550
that they probably will never
see each other again.

291
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:38,820
Are you mocking at us or what?

292
00:39:40,155 --> 00:39:43,241
We taught you and taught
and it was no use.

293
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,494
Now it turns out you can!

294
00:39:48,497 --> 00:39:53,126
He went to Spain and didn't
understand anything.

295
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:59,216
Did you ever want
to go back to Spain?

296
00:39:59,883 --> 00:40:04,012
I can't go, I've got a Russian
husband.

297
00:40:05,097 --> 00:40:06,890
And Russian children.

298
00:40:16,817 --> 00:40:20,862
I'll talk to her myself!

299
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:20,143
Ignat!

300
00:44:24,356 --> 00:44:26,066
Come here. I'm leaving.

301
00:44:45,502 --> 00:44:47,879
Always in a hurry

302
00:44:49,131 --> 00:44:51,341
Don't put it together, just give it
to me like that.

303
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:08,108
Oh, I felt an electric shock.
What shock?

304
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:15,949
As if it had already happened

305
00:45:24,249 --> 00:45:26,293
But I've never been here before.

306
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:36,887
Come on, give me the money
and stop dreaming.

307
00:45:42,684 --> 00:45:47,856
Clean up a bit,
make the place tidy.

308
00:46:11,588 --> 00:46:14,967
Don't touch anything here.

309
00:46:15,759 --> 00:46:19,304
If Maria Nikolaevna comes
tell her to wait for me.

310
00:46:33,318 --> 00:46:36,154
Come in. How are you?

311
00:46:41,827 --> 00:46:44,913
May we have another cup
for the young man?

312
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:10,897
Take the notebook from the third
shelf in the bookcase, will you?

313
00:47:19,197 --> 00:47:22,534
Read from the page that is marked
with a ribbon.

314
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:36,131
"To the question how sciences
and arts affect

315
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:39,259
people's morals, Rousseau answered:
Negatively'."

316
00:47:39,468 --> 00:47:44,640
Read only what is underlined
with the red pencil.

317
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,227
"Notwithstanding the "
Oh no!

318
00:47:50,312 --> 00:47:55,150
"The division of churches
separated us from Europe.

319
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:57,653
We remained excluded

320
00:47:58,028 --> 00:48:04,951
from every great event
that had shaken it.

321
00:48:05,535 --> 00:48:10,499
However, we had our own,
special destiny.

322
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:14,795
Russia, with her immense territory,

323
00:48:15,253 --> 00:48:17,631
had swallowed up the Mongol
invasion.

324
00:48:18,006 --> 00:48:24,930
The Tartars didn't dare
crossing our western borders.

325
00:48:26,181 --> 00:48:28,433
They retreated to their wilderness

326
00:48:28,642 --> 00:48:31,812
and Christian civilization
had been saved.

327
00:48:33,563 --> 00:48:37,192
To attain that goal
we had to lead

328
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:43,031
a special kind of life
which, while leaving us Christians,

329
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:48,120
had made us alien
to the Christian world.

330
00:48:49,746 --> 00:48:52,916
As for our historic
insignificance,

331
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:55,627
I cannot agree with you on that.

332
00:48:55,836 --> 00:49:00,632
Don't you find
anything significant at all

333
00:49:00,966 --> 00:49:03,260
in today's situation in Russia

334
00:49:03,468 --> 00:49:06,555
that would strike
a future historian?

335
00:49:08,348 --> 00:49:12,019
Although I'm heartily attached
to our sovereign,

336
00:49:12,769 --> 00:49:17,858
I'm not at all delighted with
everything I see around me.

337
00:49:19,109 --> 00:49:25,324
As a man of letters,
I'm being annoyed, insulted,

338
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:30,912
but I swear that for nothing
in the world would have made me

339
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:34,541
change my home country
or have any other history

340
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:36,960
than the history of our forbears,

341
00:49:37,169 --> 00:49:39,755
such as it was given us by God. "

342
00:49:40,422 --> 00:49:46,345
From Pushkin's letter to Chaadayev.
October 19, 1836.

343
00:49:52,225 --> 00:49:54,019
Go, open up.

344
00:50:11,703 --> 00:50:13,997
I'm afraid I've got the wrong
address.

345
00:51:18,145 --> 00:51:20,731
Ignat, how are you doing?

346
00:51:22,774 --> 00:51:24,818
Did Maria Nikolaevna come?

347
00:51:25,027 --> 00:51:30,282
No. Though some woman came,
but she's got the wrong apartment.

348
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:37,331
Find something to do
or invite somebody.

349
00:51:37,873 --> 00:51:40,375
Do you know any girls?

350
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:43,837
You mean from my class?
Oh no!

351
00:51:44,129 --> 00:51:48,800
At your age I was already in love
During the war

352
00:51:50,052 --> 00:51:55,057
With a redhead
Her lips were always blistered.

353
00:51:56,141 --> 00:51:58,852
Our military instructor was chasing
after her, he was shell-shocked.

354
00:52:00,896 --> 00:52:02,439
Are you listening to me?

355
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:12,301
What did you fire at?
You think I didn't see it?

356
00:53:15,804 --> 00:53:18,557
You were firing up!

357
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:23,061
What's wrong with that?
There's no one there.

358
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:24,896
And what if somebody was there?

359
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:28,358
There're only trees there.

360
00:53:28,567 --> 00:53:30,610
And what if somebody climbed a tree?

361
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:39,328
About face! I commanded
"about face"!

362
00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:44,458
Put down your rifle.

363
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:47,044
That's what I did.

364
00:53:47,628 --> 00:53:52,507
Did you learn drill regulations?

365
00:53:55,093 --> 00:54:01,058
About face in Russian means
exactly what I did.

366
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:08,523
About face means a turn of
360 degrees.

367
00:54:09,691 --> 00:54:15,030
What degrees? About face!

368
00:54:25,415 --> 00:54:28,919
To the firing position
forward march!

369
00:54:34,716 --> 00:54:37,344
I'm going to send you
for your parents.

370
00:54:38,345 --> 00:54:40,222
What parents?

371
00:54:42,724 --> 00:54:44,851
You'll know very soon
what parents.

372
00:54:48,605 --> 00:54:51,608
What is the firing position?

373
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,236
Down on the floor mat!

374
00:54:54,444 --> 00:54:57,364
His parents died during the siege.

375
00:55:03,453 --> 00:55:07,958
The firing position is
a firing position.

376
00:55:13,547 --> 00:55:15,590
Markov!
Yes, sir!

377
00:55:17,384 --> 00:55:19,845
Name the basic elements of

378
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:26,643
The rifle.

379
00:55:43,452 --> 00:55:44,870
The butt.

380
00:55:48,665 --> 00:55:51,835
The muzzle.
It's you who's a muzzle.

381
00:56:04,222 --> 00:56:06,266
What is the muzzle then?

382
00:56:35,128 --> 00:56:37,631
Guys! A grenade!

383
00:56:45,555 --> 00:56:48,475
It's a hand grenade!

384
00:57:01,029 --> 00:57:02,572
Don't do it!

385
00:57:03,532 --> 00:57:05,409
Down on the ground!

386
00:57:05,659 --> 00:57:07,494
You'll be killed!

387
00:57:46,325 --> 00:57:47,993
It's only a dummy grenade.

388
00:58:08,555 --> 00:58:13,268
And you say you're from Leningrad
and been under the siege

389
01:01:12,781 --> 01:01:16,284
I don't believe in premonitions.

390
01:01:16,493 --> 01:01:20,288
I have no trust in superstitions.

391
01:01:20,497 --> 01:01:23,750
I don't run from slander or venom.

392
01:01:24,209 --> 01:01:25,919
There's no death on earth.

393
01:01:26,295 --> 01:01:29,047
All are immortal,
Everything's immortal.

394
01:01:29,256 --> 01:01:31,925
Don't be afraid of death
at seventeen,

395
01:01:32,134 --> 01:01:35,762
At seventy as well
There's just reality and light.

396
01:01:36,305 --> 01:01:39,391
There's neither death nor darkness
in this world.

397
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:42,269
At last we all have reached the shore,

398
01:01:42,894 --> 01:01:45,564
And I'm the one who casts a fishing
rod

399
01:01:45,772 --> 01:01:48,191
When immortality is coming
in a shoal.

400
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:51,820
Live in a house, and it'll never
fall.

401
01:01:52,321 --> 01:01:54,698
To any of the centuries I'd nod

402
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:57,743
And enter it, a house I'd install.

403
01:01:58,285 --> 01:02:00,871
That's why with me your children
share board,

404
01:02:01,163 --> 01:02:03,540
Your wives join me at my table,
and all.

405
01:02:03,957 --> 01:02:07,044
One table serves both granddad and
grandchild:

406
01:02:07,419 --> 01:02:10,172
The future's being made right now.

407
01:02:10,547 --> 01:02:13,091
Whenever I'm to raise my hand
in tide,

408
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:16,219
I all five rays of it on you bestow.

409
01:02:16,803 --> 01:02:19,806
With collarbones, as if with
timber work,

410
01:02:20,015 --> 01:02:22,601
I propped up every day of past age.

411
01:02:22,976 --> 01:02:25,812
I measured time by a world-wide
walk,

412
01:02:26,021 --> 01:02:28,857
I passed through it like through
the Urals range.

413
01:02:29,066 --> 01:02:31,610
I chose the age up to my own measure.

414
01:02:31,818 --> 01:02:35,530
We headed south, with dust flying
away,

415
01:02:35,906 --> 01:02:38,659
The weeds smoked up, and at his own
leisure,

416
01:02:38,867 --> 01:02:41,370
His feeler on the horseshoe,
the grasshopper forecast

417
01:02:41,828 --> 01:02:44,665
He prophesied me death, as if
he were a monk.

418
01:02:44,873 --> 01:02:47,793
But with my fate strapped to my
saddle fast,

419
01:02:48,001 --> 01:02:50,629
I'm riding now in the time to come

420
01:02:50,837 --> 01:02:53,256
And surging on the stirrups to my
own drum.

421
01:02:53,924 --> 01:02:56,551
My immortality is quite enough
for me.

422
01:02:57,052 --> 01:02:59,930
For my own blood to flow ages
through,

423
01:03:00,347 --> 01:03:02,975
For steady warmth and a haven
safe and true

424
01:03:03,308 --> 01:03:05,769
I'd give my life self-willingly and
freely,

425
01:03:05,978 --> 01:03:08,730
Had not its volatile, needle-like
sword

426
01:03:08,939 --> 01:03:11,900
Been leading me, like a thread,
throughout the world.

427
01:06:27,304 --> 01:06:31,183
Marousia? And the children?

428
01:06:34,603 --> 01:06:35,854
Where are the children?

429
01:06:39,691 --> 01:06:43,070
I'm going to tell everybody
that you've stolen the book.

430
01:06:45,405 --> 01:06:49,076
What?
I will, you'll see.

431
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:57,960
Now stop it!
Go on, tell everybody!

432
01:06:58,168 --> 01:07:01,588
I will, anyway!

433
01:07:06,843 --> 01:07:08,971
Marina!

434
01:08:32,095 --> 01:08:35,182
You could have come more often.
You know that he's missing you.

435
01:08:38,435 --> 01:08:45,942
Let Ignat live with me.

436
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:52,115
Are you serious?

437
01:08:52,532 --> 01:08:56,453
You said yourself
that he would like to.

438
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,290
With you it's better to keep one's
mouth shut.

439
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:04,461
You mean I'm inventing this
for my own pleasure?

440
01:09:05,545 --> 01:09:09,341
Let's ask him.
Whatever he decides

441
01:09:10,342 --> 01:09:12,386
Besides, it will make your life
much easier.

442
01:09:14,054 --> 01:09:15,764
Why would this make it easier for me?

443
01:09:21,019 --> 01:09:22,688
Have you collected your books?

444
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,317
Go say goodbye to your father.

445
01:09:30,070 --> 01:09:34,616
Your mother and I would like
to ask you

446
01:09:35,701 --> 01:09:36,868
What?

447
01:09:40,914 --> 01:09:43,375
Wouldn't it be better if you lived
with me?

448
01:09:43,709 --> 01:09:45,127
How?

449
01:09:46,128 --> 01:09:52,009
You and I will live together.
Haven't you said so to your mother?

450
01:09:52,968 --> 01:09:58,056
Said what? When?
No, please.

451
01:10:31,465 --> 01:10:33,800
We really look alike,
don't we?

452
01:10:34,676 --> 01:10:36,386
Not at all!

453
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:58,742
What do you want from your mother?
What kind of relationship?

454
01:11:04,331 --> 01:11:07,668
The kind of relationship you had
in your childhood is impossible.

455
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:22,349
You speak of some feeling of
guilt,

456
01:11:22,557 --> 01:11:24,601
of her life being ruined because of
you

457
01:11:26,061 --> 01:11:28,271
Well, you can't get away from it.

458
01:11:30,899 --> 01:11:34,611
And what she needs is for you
to become a baby again,

459
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:38,448
for her to be able to carry you
and protect you.

460
01:11:41,702 --> 01:11:46,707
Why on earth am I meddling in it?

461
01:11:48,292 --> 01:11:49,710
It's always like this

462
01:12:01,054 --> 01:12:03,807
Why are you whimpering?
Explain it.

463
01:12:06,643 --> 01:12:09,354
Should I marry him or not?

464
01:12:16,611 --> 01:12:21,533
  Do I know him?
  No

465
01:12:22,784 --> 01:12:24,244
Is he Ukrainian?

466
01:12:24,786 --> 01:12:26,747
Does it matter?

467
01:12:28,165 --> 01:12:33,086
What is he doing?
He is a writer.

468
01:12:35,297 --> 01:12:37,883
Doesn't his name happen to be
Dostoyevsky?

469
01:12:38,258 --> 01:12:39,676
Yes, Dostoyevsky.

470
01:12:41,887 --> 01:12:45,265
He hasn't written anything
worthwhile. Nobody knows him.

471
01:12:45,974 --> 01:12:49,061
He must be about 40, isn't he?
Apparently he's got no talent?

472
01:12:52,606 --> 01:12:56,109
You've changed so much.

473
01:12:59,738 --> 01:13:02,616
So, he has no talent, he doesn't write
anything.

474
01:13:02,866 --> 01:13:04,910
He does write, but they don't
publish him.

475
01:13:07,621 --> 01:13:11,583
Look, our precious flunk
has put something on fire.

476
01:13:15,545 --> 01:13:18,256
No need to be so ironic about
his flunking.

477
01:13:18,507 --> 01:13:20,968
If he doesn't finish school,
he'll end up being drafted.

478
01:13:21,176 --> 01:13:24,721
And you will go begging
to have him exempted from the army.

479
01:13:27,015 --> 01:13:29,476
This is all the result of your
indulging him.

480
01:13:29,685 --> 01:13:33,480
By the way, the army would be
good for him.

481
01:13:33,689 --> 01:13:35,565
Why don't you call your mother?

482
01:13:35,857 --> 01:13:38,944
After Aunt Lisa's death she stayed
in bed for three days.

483
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:45,367
Wasn't she supposed to come here
at five?

484
01:13:48,036 --> 01:13:50,789
Is it so difficult
to make the first move?

485
01:13:51,581 --> 01:13:53,917
We were talking about Ignat.

486
01:13:57,421 --> 01:13:59,464
It may be my fault, too.

487
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:05,470
Or is it because we got so bourgeois?

488
01:14:06,972 --> 01:14:13,895
And our embourgeoisement is
so dense, so Asian.

489
01:14:14,438 --> 01:14:17,524
With private ownership nonexistent,
our well-being is on the rise.

490
01:14:17,941 --> 01:14:19,609
Nothing makes any sense anymore.

491
01:14:19,901 --> 01:14:21,862
Why do you get so irritated?

492
01:14:22,195 --> 01:14:25,782
I know a family
whose 15-year-old son said:

493
01:14:25,991 --> 01:14:28,327
"I'm leaving you.
It disgusts me to see

494
01:14:28,535 --> 01:14:30,746
how you weasel around
trying to please everybody. "

495
01:14:31,288 --> 01:14:34,124
Good boy.
Not like our booby.

496
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,421
Unfortunately, our boy would never
say such a thing.

497
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:41,882
I can imagine that family of yours!

498
01:14:42,341 --> 01:14:47,179
They're no worse than we are.
He works for a newspaper.

499
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:50,974
And thinks he's a writer, too.

500
01:14:56,688 --> 01:14:58,398
Though he's unable to understand

501
01:14:58,607 --> 01:15:01,485
that a book is not a way of making
money but a statement.

502
01:15:03,445 --> 01:15:06,281
A poet is called upon
to provoke a spiritual jolt

503
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:08,533
and not to cultivate idolaters.

504
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:19,836
What am I going to do?

505
01:15:20,754 --> 01:15:23,590
You're going to get married.

506
01:15:23,966 --> 01:15:28,345
Do you happen to remember
who was it who saw a bush on fire?

507
01:15:29,262 --> 01:15:30,889
I mean the angel as a bush?

508
01:15:31,974 --> 01:15:35,811
I don't remember.
In any case, it was not Ignat.

509
01:15:37,104 --> 01:15:39,648
Maybe we should send him
to a cadet school?

510
01:15:40,732 --> 01:15:46,780
An angel as a flame coming from
a bush appeared to Prophet Moses.

511
01:15:47,698 --> 01:15:50,492
He led his people out across the sea.

512
01:15:51,076 --> 01:15:54,162
Why has nothing like that
ever appeared to me?

513
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:11,972
With an amazing regularity
I keep seeing one and the same dream.

514
01:16:14,433 --> 01:16:18,854
It seems to make me return

515
01:16:20,272 --> 01:16:22,316
to the place, poignantly dear to my
heart,

516
01:16:22,524 --> 01:16:24,901
where my grandfather's house
used to be,

517
01:16:26,361 --> 01:16:34,119
in which I was born 40 years ago
right on the dinner table.

518
01:16:36,622 --> 01:16:40,542
Each time I try to enter it, something
prevents me from doing that.

519
01:16:43,295 --> 01:16:46,632
I see this dream again and again.

520
01:16:50,427 --> 01:16:56,391
And when I see those walls made of
logs and the dark entrance,

521
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:00,437
even in my dream I become aware
that I'm only dreaming it.

522
01:17:01,647 --> 01:17:08,111
And the overwhelming joy is clouded
by anticipation of awakening.

523
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:15,160
At times something happens
and I stop dreaming

524
01:17:15,369 --> 01:17:19,122
of the house and the pine trees
of my childhood around it.

525
01:17:21,458 --> 01:17:23,669
Then I get depressed.

526
01:17:25,879 --> 01:17:29,758
And I can't wait to see
this dream

527
01:17:31,176 --> 01:17:33,929
in which I'll be a child again

528
01:17:35,263 --> 01:17:37,891
and feel happy again

529
01:17:39,059 --> 01:17:44,856
because everything will be still
ahead, everything will be possible

530
01:18:34,865 --> 01:18:36,033
Mommy!

531
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:52,377
Mom, they opened up!
What's the matter with you?

532
01:20:59,635 --> 01:21:01,053
Hello.

533
01:21:04,765 --> 01:21:05,849
Hello.

534
01:21:15,525 --> 01:21:19,821
Are you Nadezhda Petrovna?
I don't think I

535
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:23,325
I'm Matvey Ivanov's stepdaughter.

536
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:26,787
He was a friend of your husband.

537
01:21:27,704 --> 01:21:30,791
What Matvey?

538
01:21:30,999 --> 01:21:35,212
The doctor. He used to live here.

539
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:40,342
Then he moved to Yurievets
and became a legal expert.

540
01:21:43,595 --> 01:21:46,348
Are you from town?

541
01:21:46,556 --> 01:21:49,643
We're from Moscow,
but we have a room in Yurievets.

542
01:21:56,441 --> 01:21:59,695
We were evacuated last fall.

543
01:22:01,571 --> 01:22:05,784
The air raids on Moscow began
and I have two kids.

544
01:22:06,118 --> 01:22:08,996
My mother has some old connections
here

545
01:22:13,583 --> 01:22:17,087
My husband is not here,
he's in town.

546
01:22:22,342 --> 01:22:25,012
Stop scratching yourself!

547
01:22:25,721 --> 01:22:29,433
Actually I came to see you.
It's a ladies' little secret.

548
01:22:36,231 --> 01:22:39,860
Come on in.
Don't stand there

549
01:22:46,658 --> 01:22:50,037
Wipe your feet.
Masha's just washed the floor.

550
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:20,442
Sit here for a while.
We won't be long.

551
01:27:34,363 --> 01:27:38,492
Why are you sitting in the dark?
Did it go out?

552
01:27:40,702 --> 01:27:42,746
You should've called us.

553
01:27:45,248 --> 01:27:47,960
What's your name?
Alyosha.

554
01:27:51,338 --> 01:27:54,841
I've got a son, too.
Not so big as you, of course.

555
01:27:55,425 --> 01:27:58,595
It's not easy having kids now,
with the war going.

556
01:27:59,471 --> 01:28:01,974
I wish I had a girl too.

557
01:28:02,599 --> 01:28:05,268
Want to have a look? He's asleep.

558
01:28:06,019 --> 01:28:08,939
We'll be quiet.
He's such a darling.

559
01:28:55,110 --> 01:28:57,946
The other day he asked his father:

560
01:28:58,655 --> 01:29:02,451
"Why is 5 kopecks bigger
than 10 kopecks?"

561
01:29:02,993 --> 01:29:08,165
I was just dumfounded, and
his father didn't know what to say.

562
01:29:09,708 --> 01:29:14,796
He always wanted a daughter.
He even thought of a girl's name.

563
01:29:16,214 --> 01:29:21,053
And I prepared a pink layette.

564
01:29:22,304 --> 01:29:24,348
Then I had to make everything anew.

565
01:29:25,098 --> 01:29:29,394
He put us up to a lot of trouble,
little rascal.

566
01:29:32,397 --> 01:29:34,691
We woke you up, didn't we?

567
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:38,695
That's your mommy's fault,
she just can't stop talking.

568
01:29:39,154 --> 01:29:44,242
See, we've got company.
Some strangers, aren't they?

569
01:29:44,618 --> 01:29:49,873
You just wouldn't wake up,
would you?

570
01:29:50,707 --> 01:29:55,087
All right, honey, go back to sleep.

571
01:30:04,805 --> 01:30:09,101
Do they become me? And the ring?

572
01:30:10,185 --> 01:30:14,731
What's wrong?
I just felt queasy.

573
01:30:15,649 --> 01:30:19,528
Of course, you've made a long trip.
I should have known better.

574
01:30:19,987 --> 01:30:22,823
Have a drink. It will warm you up.

575
01:30:25,993 --> 01:30:30,914
I just talk and talk
when I ought to make supper.

576
01:30:31,373 --> 01:30:34,209
Oh please, you don't have to do it.

577
01:30:34,418 --> 01:30:40,299
But I can't let you go like that.
We had a meal before leaving.

578
01:30:40,924 --> 01:30:43,427
I don't like his cough!

579
01:30:45,804 --> 01:30:48,265
Well, he runs wild

580
01:30:48,515 --> 01:30:52,644
We must have my husband
examine him.

581
01:30:53,103 --> 01:30:57,399
We can't wait, we have a two-hour
walk to make.

582
01:30:57,607 --> 01:31:01,570
And what about the earrings?
My husband's got the money.

583
01:31:01,778 --> 01:31:06,199
We're going to have a cock
slaughtered. Only may I ask you

584
01:31:07,159 --> 01:31:10,871
I'm three months pregnant
and having fits of sickness.

585
01:31:11,079 --> 01:31:13,915
Even when I'm milking a cow,
it gets so bad

586
01:31:14,666 --> 01:31:19,379
As for the cock
Could you?

587
01:31:21,673 --> 01:31:23,300
Well, I myself

588
01:31:25,093 --> 01:31:26,428
What, you too?

589
01:31:26,887 --> 01:31:31,224
No, but I've never done it before.

590
01:31:31,433 --> 01:31:35,896
Oh, it's nothing. Sure, in Moscow
you ate them already slaughtered.

591
01:31:39,232 --> 01:31:42,569
I usually do it right here,
on this little log.

592
01:31:43,403 --> 01:31:46,657
Here's the axe. My husband
has sharpened it this morning.

593
01:31:47,407 --> 01:31:50,661
You mean, right in the room?
We'll put a basin under.

594
01:31:50,869 --> 01:31:55,874
And tomorrow you'll take
a chicken with you.

595
01:31:56,083 --> 01:31:57,542
No, I can't.

596
01:31:58,251 --> 01:32:02,923
Maybe we'll ask Alyosha to do that?
After all, he's a man.

597
01:32:05,133 --> 01:32:06,927
Why Alyosha?

598
01:32:07,386 --> 01:32:13,600
All right, hold it tight. If it breaks
loose, it'll smash the dishes.

599
01:32:26,238 --> 01:32:29,408
Oh no, I don't feel Well?

600
01:33:18,832 --> 01:33:23,837
Calm down. Everything will be
all right.

601
01:33:25,339 --> 01:33:26,965
I wish I could see you

602
01:33:27,174 --> 01:33:29,885
not only when I feel too bad.

603
01:33:31,595 --> 01:33:34,056
Do you hear me?
Yes.

604
01:33:41,063 --> 01:33:42,856
At last I soared up.

605
01:33:43,065 --> 01:33:45,817
What's wrong, Marousia?
You feel bad?

606
01:33:46,026 --> 01:33:52,240
Don't be surprised.
I love you.

607
01:33:53,825 --> 01:33:58,830
Are you leaving already? And the
earrings? My husband'll be right here.

608
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:03,001
He's got the money.
We changed our mind.

609
01:34:03,210 --> 01:34:07,005
It's fifteen versts to the town.
It's going to be dark soon.

610
01:34:07,214 --> 01:34:09,257
That's all right, don't worry.

611
01:34:22,521 --> 01:34:26,191
A man has but one body,
Like a single cell.

612
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,611
The soul is sick and tired
Of its too solid shell,

613
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:32,990
With ears, mouth, eyes
The size of a nickel coin

614
01:34:33,282 --> 01:34:37,661
And skin all scarred and diced,
Spread over a skeleton.

615
01:34:37,995 --> 01:34:41,581
Through cornea it wings
To a heavenly spring,

616
01:34:41,790 --> 01:34:45,752
To ice-laden slings,
To a chariot birds bring.

617
01:34:45,961 --> 01:34:49,506
It hears through the grating
Of its living prison pen

618
01:34:49,881 --> 01:34:54,344
The fields' and forests' rattling,
The Seven Seas' refrain.

619
01:34:54,928 --> 01:34:59,391
Without body a soul's nude,
As a body's nude without a shirt:

620
01:34:59,683 --> 01:35:04,354
No thought's forthcoming, no good,
No idea's born and no word.

621
01:35:04,938 --> 01:35:08,942
A question that has no answer:
Whoever can come back

622
01:35:09,443 --> 01:35:13,655
From the floor where no dancer
Was ever to leave track?

623
01:35:14,197 --> 01:35:18,619
I dream of another soul,
In quite a different garb:

624
01:35:18,994 --> 01:35:22,581
While shifting between dole
And hope, it burns up,

625
01:35:22,789 --> 01:35:26,877
Like alcohol, and goes
Away, casts no shadow

626
01:35:27,336 --> 01:35:31,381
And just leaves as mementoes
The lilacs smelling of meadow.

627
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:36,678
Run on, my child, do not lament
The fate of poor Eurydice,

628
01:35:37,054 --> 01:35:41,099
Just keep on driving to globe's end
Your copper hoop for all to see.

629
01:35:41,308 --> 01:35:45,520
As long as answering to your step,
However slight might be a tone,

630
01:35:46,104 --> 01:35:50,734
The earth sends signals gay and pep
To every energetic bone.

631
01:38:35,357 --> 01:38:39,236
Mom, the kerosene stove is smoking.

632
01:38:40,737 --> 01:38:41,863
What?

633
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:02,634
Everything will depend on him.

634
01:39:02,843 --> 01:39:05,637
Do you think a sore throat could
have such an after-effect?

635
01:39:09,266 --> 01:39:11,310
A sore throat has nothing to do
with it.

636
01:39:15,605 --> 01:39:18,358
This is a common case.
Common?

637
01:39:25,490 --> 01:39:32,956
A mother dies suddenly,
then the man's wife and child

638
01:39:34,708 --> 01:39:38,337
A few days and the man is no more,
though he was quite healthy.

639
01:39:38,545 --> 01:39:40,589
But no one died in his family.

640
01:39:42,466 --> 01:39:49,348
There're such things as conscience
memories

641
01:39:49,765 --> 01:39:51,516
What memories have to do it with it?

642
01:40:01,234 --> 01:40:06,114
You think he's guilty of something?
He thinks so.

643
01:40:06,365 --> 01:40:08,200
Leave me alone.

644
01:40:12,621 --> 01:40:17,876
Did you say something?
Leave me alone!

645
01:40:20,003 --> 01:40:24,049
I just wanted to be happy.

646
01:40:25,217 --> 01:40:28,887
And what's going to happen to your
mother if you don't get up?

647
01:40:34,601 --> 01:40:39,064
It's nothing, everything will be
all right

648
01:40:41,108 --> 01:40:42,818
Everything will be

649
01:41:58,977 --> 01:42:02,314
Would you rather have a boy
or a girl?
